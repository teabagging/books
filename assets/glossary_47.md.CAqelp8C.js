But lemme tell you how good it is! S. E. Hinton in this book rivals even Robert Cormier (and I don't say that about just anybody). Pony is good and believable character, and so are Johnny and Sodapop and the rest. The ending, while unhappy, is realistic. I think it must be one of the worst things ever to die without realizing that there's still some good left in this world.

This was a wonderful book and I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had to read \\"The Outsiders\\" by S.E. Hinton with my English class this year. When I found out it was about greasers, I was excited because, to me, greasers are like the 1950s and '60's version of punk rockers, except for the fact that they don't play instruments. My favorite characters were Johnny and Dally. It is a great book that I would recommend to anyone. One of the things that I liked about it was that although it involves gangs and other questionable material,it showed the effect of all the bad things on everyone. Like, for instance, all the times when someone gets injured in a rumble or jumped, and whether the culprit is a Soc or a greaser and vice-versa, S. E. Hinton effectively and equally illustrates the hateful, destructive attitude and actions of the culprit and the hurt, shame, and anger of the victim. This ability comes in handy with boks like these, because that way, if a kid reads a part in the book where a kid gets jumped, they won't say, \\"Oh, I'm gonna go jump somebody now.\\", because about thirty seconds later, when they get to the next line and read about how hurt and ashamed and scared the victim is, they'll change their mind. Ms. Hinton also has a good ability for illustrating the consequences of violent and wrongful actions, because when you finish the book, you'll realize that everyone gets the punishment that they deserve for whatever they did tht was wrong;they don't just get away with things that are wrong. I look forward to reading other books by S.E. Hinton."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i had to read this ook as a language project so i thought it would be boring but i was so wrong. the outsiders is about how two social classes the greasers and the socs . greasers are always watching their backs and have to watch out for eachother to survive. socs on the other hand are cold emotionless kids who get their way. the story is about how ponyboy and his friend jonny(greasers)get in a fight with some socs when the one mistake jonny makes changes their lives forever. best book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book called outsiders is a great book for readers of every age.This book have it all action,drama,and mabe a little horror to.The main character of the story he is the one who makes the book with all the excitement.And theirs a gang called the SOCS.Their the gang that poneyboy and them fight its called the rumble.This book is like one of the greatest book i read.And if you read it you think so to."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders is one of the best books I ever read.

It had everything that everygood book has . A good plot and it gets you into it . I would safely call it a new age clasic. It tells exactly what any gang going teen is going through . It takes place a while ago but it realates to now more then then . I would recomend this book to anyone who likes action adventure or who wants to know what is going on in gangs today . The downfalls of this book however are that it moves at an extremly high pace ,and at times the dialect that they use is hard to comprehend. On the other hand though it never looses your attention and it addes alot to the story but the dialect and acent and slang they use. It gives you a feel for when and where the boys are from and how well educated they are. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; by S.E. Hinton is a very good book and I would recomend it to anyone. It's about a group of boys who live in a small poor part of town and belong to a group or gang of greasers. In this gang are some very strong personalities. Pony Boy is the main charictor . along with Johnny , Soda Pop, Dally{Dallas}, Darrel,Steve ,and Two Bit. They have fudes with the preeps from acrost town all the time. The greasers meet up with a girl named Cherry ,whos a preep. After this there is a serious chain of events that you'll never believe. This book deals with issues that teens today are going through .

Well it is about tome of tragedy, fun, struggles, and a lot of fights. It teaches a pperson a lot about life. There is one town and two gangs. &quot;Socs&quot; are rich, snobby, bad guys, and the &quot;Greasers&quot; don;t want any trouble. The Socs don't know when to stop picking on the Greasers. One day Ponyboy's (the narator) best friend, Johnny snapped and killed a Soc. From there the story is a wild goose chase, and keeps you on your seat to the very end. S. E. Hinton makes you want more and more at every turn.This realistic fiction is so real that you will have sympathy for the Greasers. this is one of S. E. Hinton greatest books, but these are a few more The Rumble Fish, Tex, That Was Then This is Now, and much more. If you want a comparision to another book it would be Grease, because of all the people, women problems, and cars. The Outsiders is one of the greatest pieces of writing i've ever read. It may be old but it will still have an impact and relate to your life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book about 35 years ago in grammar school. The only reason I read it was because a friend told me that it had \\"cussing\\" in it. (Those were different times, folks.) All these years later, it is one of the few books that I can't forget from that period. I reread it recently, and found it to be just as relevant today as it was then, and just as interesting. When I first read it, I had yet to live through the high school experience, with all of its associated social negativity, and so did not appreciate it in that sense. When I reread it, in hindsight, the book seemed even more relevant to our society than the first time I read it. Even though the events in the novel occur 50 years ago, it still reads like a modern novel, and is not dated otherwise. Unfortunately, I saw the movie with Matt Dillon between readings, and the second time through I could not get the brat pack faces out of my mind--the movie was good, but I don't really want to imagine the characters looking the way they did in the movie."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton tells the troubles of a young boy and the very stereotypical neighborhood he lives in with his brothers and close friends. The boys live in a small town in Oklahoma which is socially separated by the \\"greasers\\" and the \\"socials\\". This social battle is the reoccurring problem of the novel. The problem starts off when a young social was killed by a greaser. This causes the battle to get more heated but the characters start to see how this battle is taking over their lives and causing more heartache than anything.This book had a plot unlike any others. I was not able to guess what would happen next and it had a very inspiring theme. Although the book was written by a 17 year old female, evidence of this is not present in the novel. It was extremely well written and really creates a movie in your head. You get to know each character intimately and feel a part of the story. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book. It does contain some content like violence and illegal actions so be prepared for that. Other than that, it is an outstanding book that is used in many classes for a good reason."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"During my freshman year of high school, our English teacher had us read some novels from S.E. Hinton, a teenage female writer who wrote about rumbles. Her best and her original was \\"The Outsiders,\\" which told about the lives of two gangs, the Socs and Greasers. Primarily, she told the story of the Greasers and through the eyes of one certain Greaser, Ponyboy Curtis.Ponyboy is the youngest of three, living with his brothers Sodapop and Darry after the death of his parents. He hangs out with a gang that includes a few others, most notably Johnny Cade and Dallas Winston. The novel covers Ponyboy and the many rumbles that he has to fight, how he has his eye on a redheaded girl named Cherry, and the friendship that grows between him and Johnny.This novel is an excellent gem with the strong chemistry it creates between characters and at the same time has a strong development of action throughout the rumbles. This is one of those pieces that should definitely be on a high school reading list and holds plenty points of discussion.Hinton tried and tried again with rumble style stories such as \\"That Was Then, This Is Now\\" and \\"Rumble Fish,\\" but unfortunately didn't hit the mark with those. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a true and original classic that is one of a kind."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book made me think, made me cry and made me imagine. It's well written and it's obviously a classic. But I must admit I could tell it was written by a female. The tale is well crafted and most of the dialog is pretty good. However there are few lines that no young heterosexual boy would say to another. Which just gives away the fact that a woman wrote it. That is really the only gripe I have. The story is powerful and resonated with me. It's a timeless class struggle set in the most confusing years of a young man's life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"We once had to read this during literature class, and everyone in the classroom enjoyed it and the film based on it. The storyline, albeit it contains violence, is interesting and filled with action all while remaining in a basically normal setting, without any extraterrestrial beings from outer space or wizards or mythological creatures. However, the main reason why I felt the need to publish my opinion on Amazon.com was because a boy in my class who usually hated to read finally found a book that he enjoyed after reading this. It did not encourage him to read more, but he found a novel that interested him so that is definitely worth mentioning for anybody who knows a middle school student/reluctant reader. If you find yourself an acquaintance or relative of someone who, like my friend, dislikes reading, this is definitely for you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is a marvelous piece of literature about a teenager growing up in the middle of gang warfare. He just sticks to the status quo, until two friends die because of gang warfare, and then he sits down and writes a paper on gangs for an English class project. This is a deep novel, about the physical and emotional hardship of being in a gang. This created some interesting thinking points, and what made it a remarkable book was that it was written when there weren't any realistic novels about teen life. This novel portrayed a darker and truer world, and enthralled readers with its honesty."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" by S. E Hinton is an early novel based on two warring juvenile gangs, divided by economical and social background, the lower East side Greasers and the upper West side Socs. There was all kind of feelings going through my mind as I read the S.E. Hinton novel \\"The Outsiders\\". Envy, love, roughness, strength, happiness...which leads me to think of this novel as a dramatic humorist nonfiction story that represents the reality that a society in every place on earth has to face with. There are always two sides: the good ones and the bad ones. Obviously it is not possible to define each one because there are different ways of setting a preference for who is the good or the bad. The Socs are the privileged kids from the Westside that as the word Soc means society, they have nice cars, they are rich and they live for bluffing. The Greasers are the unprivileged ones who live in the poor side and have to put up with the Soc's attacks, in both moral and physical ways. A special detail to look at are the changes the protagonist undergoes during the novel which I think is one of the main purposes the author wants us to pay special attention to, since the entire plot is based on Pony's feelings and expectation for his life. In every story there are certain events that will always remain not just in our memory, but within the deepest side of our hearts which will make us remember the story forever. These events happen throughout the story and in addition to telling it, they describe the characters; letting us know how they react to different situations. This novel has different stages in which we can easily identify each character by the specific details described from each one. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a relevant novel to study as in today's society the concept of violence is an ever present theme. It is a theme that dominates adolescents all over the world. As to survive in today's society many adolescents are faced with the turbulence of growing up in a volatile society and many face the prospect of dealing with some form violence or gang warfare or know of a friend who has. I believe students would enjoy this novel because it is about \\"people roughly their own age, contemporary time, the obvious, but none the less potent, parental relationships, challenging authority, establishing one's own personality and future relationship with peers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Not only did this film lead to a good movie, but it is easy to see how it spawned other great films: American History X (which follows largely the same narrative pattern) and Stand By Me seem to be cousins of this book.The author here does one of the best jobs of tailoring the protagonist's inner voice specifically to the character. Indeed, for the whole process, the author seems deep in the mind of Ponyboy, not just pretending to be a junior high Greaser, but actually living as one for the duration of the book.In terms of payoff for reading effort, it is hard to do better than this book, which is less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had been wanting to read this book for a while, but kept putting it off. I finally ordered it and finished it in a couple of hours. It was such a good story, sad at times but had a good message in it. I gave it to my 11 year old son to read, and he enjoyed it just as much."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In The Outsiders, Ponyboy Curtis is a greaser. He lives on the east side of town in a tense rivalry with the west side- the Socs. The greasers are hoods, menaces to society, while the Socs are the rich kids. But Ponyboy is different. He aches for something better, with no Socs or Greasers, just people.His gang of greasers consist of Two-bit, the loud crazy one who never stops talking; Steve, Dally, a tough, hard eighteen-year-old who hates the world; Soda, Ponyboy's laughing brother that could make anyone grin; Darry, Ponyboy's other brother that is older than his years and takes care of Ponyboy because their parents are dead; and Johnny, a quiet, defeated boy who was beaten almost to death by the Socs and is afraid of life. Ponyboy is artistic, intelligent, and wants nothing more than to run away and leave the trouble behind.One night at a movie Pony and Johnny defend two Soc cheerleaders from Dally- who is cursing and messing with the girls. Cherry- one of the Socs- relates to Ponyboy, and he finds himself telling her about his life. Johnny and Pony are walking them home when the girls' dates- who the girls ditched because the boys came to the movie drunk- drive up in a blue mustang. They are the ones who had beaten Johnny. Cherry succeeds in diverting the fight. That night Pony comes home late and Darry in his worry and anger slaps Ponyboy and yells at him. This finally pushes Ponyboy over the edge. He decides to run away.He takes Johnny with him and they eventually decide to go back. But the blue mustang drives up. There's nothing more dangerous for a greaser than five drunk Socs looking for trouble. Because they'll find it.This amazing book was published in 1967, but it is a timeless story that any generation will love and enjoy. It leaves you amazed and you feel like you understand the hard lives these boys live.One of my favorite parts of this book is the symbolism of gold. Ponyboy remembers his mother as beautiful and gold. Sodas old horse that he loved was gold. And pony and cherry can see through their differences because they both love to watch the golden sunsets. One of the character's- I'm not going to tell you which one- dying words to Ponyboy are \\"stay gold\\".I love Ponyboy because he can see through the veil that divides the Socs and the greasers. He narrates the story and once said, \\"We must not be that different after all, we see the same sunset\\". I think this idea can go farther than Socs and greasers but applies to the whole world. We all live in the same world and none of our lives are easy. This theme repeats throughout the story.Ponyboy sees that there is still good left in the world even through the fighting, rivalry, and death. This makes him my favorite character. He doesn't hate the world like many of the others.One thing that makes me sad is how many of the greasers see things. They don't see the good like Ponyboy; they only hate. Dally says to pony in one scene, \\"You get tough like me and nothing can touch you.\\" But what he doesn't understand is that if you live that way nothing can ever let you out. Dally is trapped in his own hatred and protective barrier. He's seen and felt too much for his eighteen years and has been hardened.Something I like about this book is the comic relief it gives. Ponyboy and his brothers will joke around or make fun of the Socs. This really helps you stop and let go of the breath you have been holding since the action began.This story uses suspense and foreshadowing to keep you turning the pages. It is a quick read. I could read The Outsiders over and over and never get tired of. I think the writing style (fantastic) is why this story will never reach a point when it won't be read and loved.The best part of this book to me is Ponyboy's insight on life that is easy to understand, but makes a difference in the way you see things. After reading this story, I find myself thinking about people's motives and trying to understand the ways the live, because no one is that different after all. We all see the same sunset.3 Book Bees Blog"},{"Title":"Fas Ferox - A Modern Day Mythology - World Walkthrough","review":"I found a link to this on James Curcio's website and as I've liked most of what he's put out so far I figured I should check this out as well.I'm not sure exactly how to describe it.

Since the last book left me with a cliff hanger ending, as did every book in the series before it, I was eager to read this one and I was not disappointed. In this book, Milla talon hand, as she has been named since she caries the talon of Danir, is still leading the icecarls in an attack against the castle so as to stop the veil from being destroyed and unleashing the spirits of Aenir into the world. As she does this Tal, his half of the violet keystone taken from him by the powers of evil, is fighting to achieve the same goal as Milla and her icecarls. Together, just as they began the journey, they must save their world from Sharrakor who dreams of controlling both the worlds. It is only here that Tal and Milla see how much they have changed since they first set out on the task, the task that turned into a quest, the quest that turned into a battle. the part in the bok that I think describes the two children best is &quot;somehow the chosen gad almost become an icecarl, and the icecarl was almostt a chosen, both of them blending the best of their two peoples.&quot;I am hoping that there will be another book in the series but I know that there will not be since the end of the book had a note of finality about it that cannot be mistaken. This book was as enjoyable as all the others in the series and, even if it is the end of a series it is not the end of garth Nix's writting and I am looking forwards to reading more from him."},{"Title":"Violet Keystone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Seventh Tower (Pb))","review":"Tal and Milla have gone their separate ways.

If the veil falls, the Dark World is doomed. Tal and Milla will once again have to work together. But Sushin is much stronger than he appears, and his true identity will shake them to the core. Their only hope of defeating him is the Violet Keystone, but will Tal and Milla be in time to save their world? All fans of the Seventh Tower series won't want to miss this thrilling conclusion. I was worried I might be disappointed when I saw this was the last book. However, I am happy to say that this book was a great ending to this great series, and I hope Garth Nix writes another series set in the Dark World."},{"Title":"Violet Keystone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Seventh Tower (Pb))","review":"Tal and Milla have been separated, but each have the same goal, stop Sushin for destroying the veil and letting in the shadows from Aenir.

However she has been separated from the main troops and the few people she have with her are not going to be enought to stop the Chosen and their Spiritshadows. Just when all else seems to have failed Milla suddenly is able to summon her half of the Violet Keystone and does one of the most powerful magic. But unfortunately she doesn't know how to stop it...but Ebbit, Crow, Tal's mother Grail arrive just in time to save them.

If you like Harry Potter than I think you should read this series."},{"Title":"Violet Keystone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Seventh Tower (Pb))","review":"First, I won't give away the ending.In this book, Tal and Milla continue to grow. Milla learns compassion while Tal learns to call upon inner strengths that he never knew he had. Both Tal and Milla learn that all people are people regardless of where they were born and they learn that the only way to judge a person is as an individual rather than what group they are from. Garth Nix has written a great series that breaks the mold in several ways. Perhaps the most profound way is that he tears down traditional gender roles by having a compassionate male hero and an aggressive female hero.

What started out for a search for a Sunstone to save his dying mother has led Tal to an unbelievable adventure -- and a terrifying journey. Milla, Warrior Chief of the Icecarls, is fighting fiercely for salvation. And the haunting power of the Violet Keystone rests in the balance. The two children are fighting a war that holds the key to their destiny. The hideous plan for the destruction of the Dark World may come at last if Sushin is not stopped in time. And the outcome lies in the hands of two children... and one powerful evil.

I won't say much, to avoid spoiling the story for those who haven't read it, but trust me, you will not be able to put this one down! Be prepared for several unexpected plot twists, as well as a character death.Suffice to say, this book was awesome. A triumphant conclusion to a series that was definitely worth my time. I have only a few minor gripes, the first being that since the series is called the SEVENTH tower, it would be more fitting if there were seven books in the series instead of just six. Though the final conclusion was good, it was a little rushed, and a few things that should have had scenes devoted to their resolution (you'll know what I mean once you've read the book) were just explained away in the last scene.

In fact, I think the story is stronger for it.It is often too easy to become distracted by the element of romance, to the point where whoever the main character is interested in becomes merely important as a love element. It is of course possible to have a story where there is romance that is very strengthening to the story and to the characterizations of both parties. That is often very important. But this tale breaks from the love-interest assumption, just as it breaks from many other genre assumptions.Instead, both Tal and Milla experience a different kind of melding of souls. There is of course the joining of their shadows to the Storm Shepards Andras and Odris, and through this they feel a strange spiritual connection. But deeper than this is the sharing of societies that occurs between Tal and Milla. They each become an avatar of their society, yet also an outcast, while also absorbing qualities of each other's societies. They were then separated and pushed through more change, so that when they meet again, they are even more able to recognize the change in each other.This kind sharing and learning is long overdue in the Dark World, and it is an experience that transcends gender; a romance in this situation would actually weaken the story, since then it would be more about the personal sharing that this boy and girl experience. Rather, the strength, indeed the whole point of this sharing, is that His People and Her People are being shared. The sharing has nothing to do with being a boy or girl, but with being a Person.This also occurs, to a much lesser degree, with Tal and Crow, and with Milla and Malen. These secondary sharings, though, are more about Tal and Milla recognizing and dealing with other aspects of their own societies, demonstrated by the presence Crow and Malen; through these associations, both Tal and Milla must acknowledge and come to terms with a previously-assumed superiority that is not entirely appropriate, and with shame of personal failure (by the rules of their own societies), though it was a failure that has opened the door to growth, and so was vital to the health of the entire society."},{"Title":"Violet Keystone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Seventh Tower (Pb))","review":"THis will end up being a hodgepodge review of the entire series becuase each book blends into the other.

And the reader is expected to sympathise with the hard-luck heroine named Lisa (who is based on Roxanne Pulitzer) who is loses her parents in a tragic house fire and takes work as a fitness instructor at the tender age of seventeen to pay her way through the world.This novel has so many flaws, it would take me a much longer post and more time to recount them all. Suffice to say, that there are too few likable characters in this novel to warrant me caring about what happens to any of them. The storyline is old hat with the prerequisite happy ending where the bad people die and the good people live happily ever after. Even a small detail like the heroine, Lisa, and her intended, Bobby, possibly being brother and sister couldn't take the rosy glow off the ending.

Typical stuff you might say, but what sets the novel apart from the many paint-by-the-numbers releases out there is in its unique approach of style. Booth uses a lyrical undertone while building a richer and craftier plot. Indeed, she works hard to create a variation on the same theme.

The authors give a challenging but accessible introduction to the ways in which urban theory has met with literary and cultural studies. The book then covers a refreshing range of cities and texts (nice to see more than the usual New York, London, LA) and often the familiar cities (like Paris, New York) are made different through the subjects discussed - Brooklyn and Harlem rather than downtown Manhattan, Parisian banlieues rather than the city of light.

What a wonderful account of the devastating storm that hit the islands of Assateague and Chincoteague and the relief efforts to rebuild the islands and the devastated wild pony population.It was very heartwarming to read in the epilogue excerpts from actual letters of children that sent in their hard earned money to buy back the ponies sold at previous Pony Penning Days to replenish the wild herds of Assateugue. These children and others like them preserved a tradition that had been maintained for over 100 years and because of them continues on today. In fact, Marguerite Henry dedicated this book to those very children that made it all possible.Marguerite Henry does an excellent job of using local dialect in the telling of the story, especially with Grandpa and Grandma. You can not help but become involved in the characters and their concerns become very real to you.I read this book many many years ago and had forgotten a great deal of the story.

In this, the sequel to Misty of Chincoteague, author Marguerite Henry tells the story of how Misty, now famous through her books, faced delivering her 3rd foal in the middle of a fierce gale that struck the island. Like the other Misty books, this was based in fact, as a powerful gale blew through the area during this time and jeopardized the lives of many of the islanders. Misty's story mirrors the fight for survival and is one of the most gripping pieces of equine fiction I've ever read.There isn't really anything bad I can say about the book. Wesley Dennis' illustrations are amazing in their detail and add to the story. Henry captures the fear of the people in a way that, quite frankly, scared me as a child, but kept me reading; I needed to see how the story ended. There is a particularly poignant scene after the storm where Grandpa Beebee goes to check on his herds and finds the storm toll to be high; Henry puts you in the boat with him and it is heart-breaking. (I found myself thinking about this scene this past fall, when the island was threatened by a hurricane, hoping it wouldn't be repeated.

Like Poe's purloined letter, Viroli would have us see the republican tradition as an overlooked political possibility. Viroli's task, therefore, is to bring out the distinct shape of republican thought from the more familiar trappings of contemporary liberalism. But secondly, he must make clear what has been lost in setting aside republicanism and enlist us in his revival of republican politics.Viroli argues we should see liberalism as a derivation of the republican tradition not as a necessary successor. He calls liberalism an \\"impoverished or incoherent republicanism, but not an alternative to republicanism\\". What liberalism has lost, Viroli argues, is a conception of liberty that takes account of forms of domination that limit individual freedom. He also argues that republican patriotism offers a means of energizing civic life that liberalism lacks. This republican form of patriotism, however, remains distinct from the faults of nationalism or ethnic chauvinism (an argument made more fully in Viroli's earlier book, For Love of Country).To a large degree, the theoretical points Viroli makes regarding republicanism are drawn from two other recent books, Philip Petit's Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government, and Quentin Skinner's Liberty Before Liberalism. Interested readers would do well to address those two books prior to taking up Viroli. But Viroli brings spirit to this revival of republican thought and his book adds a myriad of illustrative examples of republican thinking from the history of Italian political thought. The pages are animated by the hope that the republican tradition might make a return to the peninsula that has given the world so many great republican theorists (the book was originally written in Italian for an Italian audience) and it is here, in the practical advice for animating republican politics that Viroli demonstrates ingenuity in his use of history and argument. \\"Contemporary republican theorists should learn from the wisdom of their classical forerunners and think of disputes over political liberty as conflicts between partisan interests and conceptions, not as philosophical debates whose goal it is to ascertain or demonstrate the truth. ... Evaluations of all political actions tend to be partisan, subjective, driven by passions; disputes in the real world are neither scientific nor philosophical but, rather, rhetorical in the classical sense of the term.\\" One hopes that the next evolution in Viroli's work will bring us more of this practical, rhetorical argument for the practice of republican politics, inspired (but not overwhelmed) by the history of republican thought, and thus succeed at even greater persuasion as to the virtues of contemporary republicanism. ~ J. D. Petersen"},{"Title":"Republicanism","review":"I picked up a copy of Maurizio Viroli's \\"Republicanism\\" a few weeks ago in the Princeton U. bookstore. It has been a very interesting read, about the nature of republic, from an Italian (whose nation produced the likes of Caesar, Cicero, Medici, Machiavelli, Borgia, and Victor Emmanuel).The book's 124 pages is a quick-read in civic consciousness. (I read the entire book on the brief journey home from the bookstore.) Viroli firmly documents his discussion with 12 pages of endnotes.Viroli's analysis is refreshing and provocative. Avoiding contemporary North American political jargon he offers a different look at \\"direct participatory democracy\\". He suggests that all political theory is founded upon basic moral claims. These claims are the sovereign society's choices.He suggests that republican theory is a desire to be free of dependence while non-republican theory (Viroli labels \\"liberal\\") begins with freedom from interference (or capabilities of performance). He believes that absolute republicanism is impossible (emancipation, he says, requires dominance).Civic virtue (whose highest form is love of country) is the basic necessity of republicanism. This \\"patriotism\\" (as independent self-governing) is much different from \\"nationalism\\" (which reflect a collective will of dependence). Viroli sees ultimate problems with republics: they can be maneuvered to served unjust and irrational causes, steering them away from morality. Non-republics may lead to national common dependence and domination (or extreme restraint and restriction), which is capable of manipulating moral principles.Viroli proposes other socio-political ideas through the book (liberty, revenge, glory, equality, freedom, democracy, etc.). It is an interesting and informative read.\\"Republicanism\\" offers a significant political reflection for the 21st century. It could be well used for teaching politics and is a good gift candidate. It is highly recommended to all students of political science, sociology, and history."},{"Title":"Republicanism","review":"Maurizio Viroli ends \\"Republicanism\\" with an insightful, if very pessimistic, view of a contemporty malaise. \\"Democratic institutions today are suffering a serious malaise, a lack of passion, commitment, or loyalty that affects different democratic counstires differently but affects them all . . . Republicanism should propose itself in democratic multicultural countries as a new political vision of a civic ethos that reconnects the words 'liberty' and 'responsiblitity'.Certainly this book, filled with concepts and ideas, can be read and viewed differtly and for many good reasons. A refresher course on what true Republicanism is. A background for students of U.S. history into the theory and theorists that influenced our own form of government. My own sence of this terrific discourse was that our own politics could be greatly influenced if read by pundits and politicians, party leader and voters alike. Step back. Think. Read. What are our guiding pricipals and what form of government do we want. What are we willing to give up in terms of priviledge and liberty for the \\"greater good\\" and what IS that greater good.While this book was written by and Italian for Italians its application is truly universal. It is short. It is packed with ideas. Many, myself included, should read much, if not all, of it twice to comprehend the arguments. Whatever your politics, this book forces you to think about the greater, and more philosophical, aspects of any form of government or power."},{"Title":"Cooking inn style: Clauser's bed & breakfast","review":"I have several cook books, most are adequate in the intended purpose, how to make a dish, but this one goes that extra step. The best thing about Cooking Inn Style was the stories &amp; poetry that were included, and with the wonderful color pictures of Clauser's country kitchen, it all gave you the sense that you were right there while &quot;Mom&quot; had created every meal with pride and love. My favorite recipe so far is the Vanilla Toast, or &quot;Cowboy Toast&quot;, as the Authors sons were so cleverly tricked into calling it. I have also made the Firehouse Breakfast, and the yummy Hello Dolly's. This is a great cookbook that has not only inspired me to make a few new dishes, but after reading about Clauser's Bed &amp; Breakfast and the little town that it's in, has inspired my wife and I to have a few of the meals prepared by Marge Clauser personally the next time we visit Florida."},{"Title":"Wild Tulips","review":"Beth Bruno really knows families, and she really knows writing.

For instance, the section \\"Late Bloomers\\" starts with the story of her now-grown son's attention difficulties in kindergarten and first grade, and ends with a reflection on teacher-student \\"styles\\" and the necessity for parents to be advocates for their children. She says, \\"Significant differences between student and teacher learning styles or personalities may strongly affect learning outcomes for individual students...Parents usually know their children best...Cooperation and persistence will most likely lead to effective changes.\\" Beth Bruno's style is conversational and friendly, and she tells a good story.

The author writes with honesty about the mistakes she has made, as well as about the satisfactions and joys she derives from her family and her work. Many of her pieces are grounded in family values from a gentler, slower time: kids riding their bikes around the neighborhood instead of watching TV, extended family vacations at a cabin on the shores of Lake Michigan, mother-child talks over a sink full of dishes. Yet she is never saccharine: she acknowledges marital conflicts, strong-willed children, and the need for discipline. Her candid style does not gloss over the fact that it is difficult being a stepmother, parenting a teen, or raising an infant. Beth Bruno has spent decades as a daughter, granddaughter, wife, mother, stepmother, teacher, and counselor, and each of her roles as a student of human nature deepens the wisdom from which she draws her writing. Each brief section of &quot;Wild Tulips&quot; indicates that the author lives fully and thoughtfully. She is a close observer of the people around her-ranging from an employer (a former SS commander) for whose daughter she acted as nanny, to a lively four-year-old who would rather count dead flies than answer assessment questions--and she recounts her wide-ranging experiences with them in a way that makes the reader ponder, wipe a moist eye, or chuckle.

It is really more of a thriller. Victoria Jones, an indifferent London typist loses her job in a typing pool for impersonating her boss's wife and meets a charming young man in a park. Only, he is about to leave for Baghdad. Parting is such sweet sorrow! Not so, thinks Victoria. Undeterred by this obstacle to romance, the resourceful Londoner secures a job paying her passage out East. There she becomes embroiled in international espionage, is forced to flee people who are out to kill her, and finds herself working on an archeological dig. Christie writes in a mature and witty style. The descriptions of post WWII Baghdad and Basrah are fascinating, as are the fully-fleshed (for Christie) cast of characters. Does Victoria ultimately find love? Yes, but not where she expects it. A thoroughly absorbing read for any Christie fan. For another exotic A.C., check outMurder On the Orient Express (The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection)"},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"In this 1951 novel -- which is perhaps more relevant today than in its own time -- Christie shows her remarkable talent for spinning a web of characters that, ultimately, entangles and engulfs the reader like none other of her 80 odd titles. This book offers a relatively flawless plot and an intriguing set of characters that are really just side dishes to the staggering atmosphere the reader takes from this book's pages. By the story's end you smell, see, feel, and hear every molecule that the characters experience -- and it's more than you might wish! The story is deep and complicated, and the characters are numerous, but the outcome is really nothing short of intoxicating. This is a dark horse that is very much a must-read for its eerily prophetic 1950s look into the Middle-East, which seems rather more potent in the early twenty-first century given what our world has faced as recent. The vast aroma of the Middle East never seemed so invigorating as when you are on the loose with one of the many elite members of the slow-to-start but increasingly fast-paced plot. Breathtaking description, enough to guide the reader but little enough to let you imagine on your own, sets you down running into a maze of panic and frenzy. I believe this is Christie at her best! Which is not something one should say lightly."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Agatha Christie appears to be harkening back to her earlier &quot;young girl as adventuress&quot; theme in this novel which centers around Victoria Jones, a protagonist who specializes in mimicry and lies. The combination gets her in endless trouble.The story begins when she meets an attractive young man named Edward in FitzJames Gardens one afternoon. They have an immediate bonding, but Edward is scheduled to leave very soon for Baghdad in connection with his job with a cultural arts group called The Olive Branch. Not one to be easily discouraged, Victoria sets about finding a position that will allow her to follow Edward to Baghdad. Her search for him in this colorful city involves her with many suspicious characters, a badly wounded man who dies in her hotel room, and a great look at an archaeological dig, a particular specialty of Mrs. Christie's.It is all wildly incredible, definitely improbable, but still an entertaining work with many likeable and well-drawn characters."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"With all that's going on in Baghdad today, this book provides much more than just a great Agatha Christie read, it provides insights into what Baghdad was like in the 1950's.The plot basically revolves around a young lady who follows her love interest from england to Baghdad. While she is there, she gets caught up in an underground network of people out to destroy the world forever.Interesting imagery and descriptions of Baghdad, the Tigris, and Basrah which are kind of sad when you look at all the violence that has happened in that region since then (Iran/Iraq war, first gulf war, second gulf war).I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"I first read this book several years ago and have subsequently revisited it many times, not so much for the story which is inconsistent at best, but for the great atmosphere. In her real life, Christie had traveled extensively in the Middle East with her archeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan and her knowledge of this region enables her to paint a fascinating portrait of Baghdad. She also successfully captures a real sense of evil that has to be defeated at all costs that makes the story gripping. But the actual plot is pretty implausible - world domination from some remote area of the world? I looked up my atlas and still couldn't identify which part of the world she meant! Also, isn't it a little unrealistic that an untrained Englishwoman could just blunder her way to success when skilled spies failed? Still, I would recommend the book just for its amazing ambience and not focus so much on the story."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"The more mystery books I read, the more I realize just how incredible Christie was at what she did.This mystery centers around, not so much a murder, but the plot of a political overthrow (Is the overthrow a good thing? Or a bad thing? And even, does it exist?). Our protagonist, Victoria, finds herself suddenly placed in the middle of it all, and must decide just how involved she wants to be.\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" has an intriguing blend of all sorts of mystery points: murder, mistaken identity, spies, lies, and even a bit of romance.I think what really won me over was the detailed and diverse cast of characters, headed by the smart and clever Victoria, who has a fantastic imagination, and an ability to create elaborate lies and stories, but whom fails to tell convincing *true* stories. Victoria isn't really \\"book smart\\" and she's not entirely \\"street smart\\" but she's clever and has a wonderful ability to never give up, and an optimistic heart that makes her a pleasure to follow through the pages.Not every chapter is devoted to Victoria's perspective, however, and in the beginning we have several chapters from several points of view. This could have been frustrating and annoying, but for some reason I did not find it so and was instantly drawn in and hooked to each of the mini-stories (if you do find it tiresome, I highly suggest you give the book at least 5 chapters or so, until you settle into the main plot).This book isn't overly gruesome or graphic, and while there *may* have been a few points I'd have liked better clarification on, overall I thought the mystery was explained nicely and neatly.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"When i read this book first, i thought \\"well, that was an average to good Christie, nothing extra special...\\" but now i've re-read it, i am forced to change my opinion!This is an excellent book. Its exciting and tense, there are twists aplenty, which keep the material fresh and interesting. It's packed full of interesting and enigmatic characters. Sir Rupert Crofton Lee, Carmichael, Dakin, etc, all of whom we dont see a great deal of, but we are left wanting to know a lot more about them. A sure sign of good characters and characterisation.The plot is intriguing, and you are never entirely sure of what is going on, who is who, what is what, etc, up until the final pages, then it all becomes clear.The setting is great...the sweltering heat and dustiness of Baghdad is an excellent setting for this type of story (indeed, any type of story) and really adds to the atmosphere.Victoria Jones is a likeable lead character, human and quirky. (Sometimes annoying?) But in the end, you care for what happens to her.The backing cast of characters is large, but great. And overall, the freshness of this story, the excitement and intrigue contained within its pages, all adds up to make this a very different, but very high class Christie read."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"I always felt that Agatha Christie was not at her best when delving into the (for her, fantasy) world of spies, government secrets & espionage. When she does, the results seem more Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. I really don't know why she did it because the results were like THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD.Christie does manage to squeeze by with her very practical knowledege learned from being on real archaeological digs in the Middle East with her second husband. She shows a real appreciation of the people, culture & daily life.If you are a dedicated Christie fan, you're probably going to want to read all her mysteries--including this one. If you're just curious about the Agatha Christie Phenomena, I'd pass on this one."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"You mention Agatha Christie and you may say \\"period\\" and \\"dated\\" where I may say entertaining and inventive. THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD strays a bit outside Christie's patented cerebral whodunits in that it's an espionage thriller, more along the lines of THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT and THE SECRET ADVERSARY. Here, we meet another of Dame Agatha's clever young heroines harboring a romantic yen for adventure.The impending Middle East summit among the leaders of the world's true super powers has the British secret service in a frenzy. A whisper floats regarding a bid for world domination by a sinister organization and an intent to derail the summit talks. The key is British agent Henry Carmichael who is coming to Baghdad with insurmountable proof of this devilish plot. Unknown assassins await him at every turn. Bad cess to him, then, for not being the protagonist of the book.That role falls to the unwitting Victoria Jones, an inexpert typist - but with a facility for telling elaborate lies - who'd rather while away the work hours doing impressions of the boss's wife. Sacked for such, Victoria sits near penniless in the park and chances upon a good-looking young stranger, with the ensuing discourse leaving Victoria charmed and in love. When the handsome gent remarks that he's soon off to Baghdad, Victoria determines to follow, never mind the lack of funds or her dim prospects or dearth of influential contacts. Being kind-hearted, during my initial impression of Victoria Jones, I elected to regard her as \\"indefatigable,\\" although \\"staggeringly naive\\" may also be applicable. What's undeniable is that Christie writes her heroine as very likable. I even relished the character quirk which allows Victoria to spin off outrageous falsehoods, and yet, when it comes to narrating true stories, she has trouble being convincing.In dusty, exotic Baghdad, Victoria Jones pursues romance and finds it from an unexpected source. But when a dying spy stumbles into her hotel room one night and gasps out the cryptic words \\"Lucifer...Basrah...Lefarge...\\" Victoria is straightaway drawn into a world of shadowy intrigue. And this is where her remarkable knack for stretching truths comes in so very handy. Agatha Christie imbues her heroine with quick wits and a wonderful sense of optimism and a terrific \\"I'll see this thru\\" pluckiness, assets that just may be enough to see her through. And the amateur detecting Victoria does engage in would make Hercule Poirot himself proud. Although, the \\"Lucifer\\" clue that Veronica pieces together is a bit of a stretch.THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD, more a thriller than a mystery, has a pace that speeds along. A strength of the book is that Christie has taken time to flesh out her colorful supporting characters, something she sometimes neglects to do. Her immersive descriptions of a post-world war Baghdad and Basrah plant you directly into the scenes, elbow to elbow with the adventurous Victoria. I absolutely recommend THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD, a wonderfully written tale of espionage and escapism, of a villain that ambushed me, and of a hopelessly optimistic heroine who, it turns out, has the brains and the heart to make good on that optimism. Somewhere along the way, Victoria Jones - pursuing love, working her angles, propelling the plot - manages to help save the day. Maybe the world. Not bad for a lousy typist."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Since I'm finding the reviews for Kindle to be somewhat haphazard I'm trying to segregate the Kindle reviews from the reviews of the books themselves:From a non-Kindle perspective this is my favorite Agatha Christie story, and it loses nothing in translation.

I'm not about to spoil the terrific, tension-mounting plot, but the mystery (all of her books are mysteries; this one is no different in that respect) involves spies, both good and bad, leakage, intrigue...no shocking murders in quiet English towns here, folks.Our leading lady is Victoria Jones, shorthand typist and incorrigible liar, her &quot;fertile brain&quot; is ever-ready for cooking up believable stories and she can twist &quot;little indiarubber face&quot; into a remarkable imitation of any person. It's refreshing that she's not pretty; so many heroines have that as well as wit and kindness!

There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now?

They are smitten. Edward, however, must leave for Baghdad the next day. Impetuously, Victoria decides to find a way to Baghdad herself. While there, she becomes embroiled in murder and international intrigue. What message was the spy trying to pass along before he bled to death in front of Victoria? What's behind the pollyanna-ish front of the organization employing Edward and Victoria? Most importantly, will all the people able to make a difference end up dead before the world is doomed?A nicely paced departure from Ms. Christie's usual work. Instead of a sitting room filled with a dead body and a half-dozen suspicious potential heirs, we're given mysterious organizations, exotic locales and, of course, no dearth of bodies. This book is, perhaps, most admirable for breaking Ms. Christie's tendencies. However, it is also a quick and interesting read in that fun-loving mid-century British spy fiction genre. Something of an amateur James Bond without the technological fetish - so don't expect everything to be entirely plausible. Ms. Christie's fans will want to be quite aware that, while there is some mystery, this novel is more a garish spy novel than a proper locked room conundrum."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Although Agatha Christie is best known for the mystery stories that star either Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, there are several books that feature neither of these detectives and instead concentrate on one-off protagonists that range from amateur sleuths to young adventurers. In most cases (at least the ones that I've read) the protagonists are swept up - sometimes against their will - into adventures that read like spy thrillers, filled with danger, espionage and plots for world-domination! There are twenty-three of these types of Christie books altogether (discounting the Tommy and Tuppence novels), so if you like \\"They Came to Baghdad\\", there's plenty where that came from!In this case, young Victoria Jones has found herself between jobs once again, thanks an untimely impersonation of her boss. Whilst indulging in a bout of self-pity in the local park, she meets a young man named Edward and the two find themselves quite taken with each other. On an impulse, Victoria decides to follow Edward to Baghdad and soon finds herself caught up in a mystery when a British spy stumbles into her room and dies on her bed (yikes!) Political forces from around the world are converging on Baghdad, and Victoria ends up being key to the events that will shape history.It would be wrong to give away too much of the twisty plot, suffice to say there's a dodgy cultural-diversity group, a surreal kidnapping and escape into the desert, some wonderful descriptions of an archeological dig and some of the best characterization that Christie has to offer. As an author who is often critised for being too heavy on plot (to the detriment of other aspects of storytelling), Christie fills \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" with a host of intriguing characters, none of whom are who they appear to be - not even Victoria herself, as well as beautiful descriptions of Iraq in the 1950s, both on a political and geographical scale.This is only to be expected considering that Christie spent many months in Iraq - her husband was an archeologist, and Christie obviously picked up on the wonderment to be found in archeology, as when Victoria has an epiphany over an uncovered bowl. It's a surprisingly beautiful passage that holds within it the themes of the novel: the importance of the domestic sphere and the sanctity of the ordinary life over the lofty ideals of political and revolutionary circles.Victoria is a great protagonist: spunky, determined, funny and with an inner sense of right and wrong that gives her the moral strength to make the right decisions when it becomes clear what her role is in the extraordinary situation she finds herself in. I'm far from having read all of Agatha Christie's books, so it may be pre-emptive to say this, but I predict that when I get to my final Christie mystery, \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" will rank up there as one of my favourites."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"I thought this book was extremely entertaining (although I had a bit of trouble keeping up with all the twists and turns)and somewhat in the style of &quot;Passenger to Frankfurt,&quot; albeit not quite. Whereas &quot;Passenger to Frankfurt&quot; had the same basic theme of a someone with an oversize ego trying to rule the world, I'd say that Sir Stafford Nye is just a little more...stable than Victoria Jones, in whom I see just a hint of young Tuppence. &quot;They came to Baghdad&quot; also manages to be more lighthearted for just this reason. It also gives us a glimpse of the Middle East, and especially Iraq, before Saddam and friends. Anyway, read the book, and if you disagree with anything I said please don't tell anyone."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"This was one of those books that keeps you up, constantly drags you on. I would not say it was the very best of her books, merely because of the improbability of most of the events. Such as, who would exchange polite conversation with someone and then decide you've fallen in love? And even more improbable, who would chase that near stranger halfway around the world?This is precisely what happens in They Came to Baghdad. They only other thing I should mention is that once arriving in Baghdad, the heroine sets her foot in a whole lot of danger...and starts to wonder who is on her side and who is her enemy. The best part is when she finds a dying man in her hotel room bed...don't worry, I'm not giving anything away. Do try it, though."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Mysteries usually keep you sitting on the edge, wondering who the guilty person is. In this case, I sat on the edge, wondering what I would find around the next corner in this magical and exotic place called Iraq. Reading this book, I actually forgot what horrors were going on in this enchanted land, and while I was mentally in that land, I found myself wanting to come back again, not just to meet the characters in \\"They Came to Baghdad\\", but to see the old hotels, the tea rooms, the Tigris as it flowed to meet the Euphrates. I no longer cared whether the main characters loved each other or simply wanted to take advantage of each other.If you like mysteries, I think you'll like this one. If not, I think you'll appreciate just being there in Baghdad prior to the horrors we see on nightly news. Either way, it's worth the small price of the book, or a trip to your library."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"This 1951 novel is highly reminiscent of some of Christie's earlier works like THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT or the Tommy and Tuppence adventures as well as similiarities to the later PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT. None of Christie's usual detectives like Poirot or Miss Marple appear, nor does it follow her usual 'cozy' formula.The story opens with Victoria Jones finding herself once again between jobs. It seems that Victoria is not very good at her job of shorthand/typist but what she lacks in clerical skills she makes up for in her skill at lying. While sitting in the park considering her options she meets a charming young man who is just perfect except that he is leaving for Baghdad shortly. Victoria soon decides that this young man is the one for her at sets out to follow him to Iraq. She overcomes the obstacles of lack of funds and not knowing her young man's last name but soon finds herself involved in a vast international conspiracy.As always with a Christie book the clues are all fairly laid out for the reader to follow but there are many twists and surprises along the way to keep the reader entertained.This adventure has much in common with Elizabeth Peters works, lots of action, improbable situations and more than a touch of romance."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"This is an interesting story, entertaining to read. It is mildly exciting. I enjoyed the somewhat flawed heroine and the setting."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Most of the Agatha Christie stories I've read are murder mysteries. Someone gets killed early in the story and then the race is on to see if our heroes can gather the clues and unmask the villain.\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" is more like a James Bond spy thriller. Great events are happening. The reader knows a little but we're larger in the dark at first. Very few people are exactly as they seem. It is about a third of the way through the book before someone dies.This is a fun book. As always Agatha Christie does a great job building characters, providing enough clues that the reader knows some of what is going on, but we don't have the whole story so there is suspense on just what is going on and will the villains be unmasked.If you enjoy Agatha Christie and are willing to try something other than the typical murder mystery, give this book a try."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"One of Christie's spy stories. A couple of unsuspecting individuals get entangled in a dangerous game of international intrigue. Some elements of this reminds me of her other spy story \\"Destination Unknown\\", but this one is more down to earth and more believable. As usual with Christie, you spend the whole time guessing who's to trust and who are the bad guys. All the clues are in front of you, but you will be surprised over and over. Fascinating."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"I have tended to avoid most of Christie's post-World War II novels. Partly because as she grew older her skills began to fade. Several of her last books are really pretty perfunctory. Mainly, though, I think Christie belongs to the pre-1945 world when the Empire was still intact and high tax rates and changed social attitudes had not yet taken their toll on the British upper classes, who are the focus of most of her books. So, I picked up a copy of this book, first published in 1951, without great expectations ... and was in for a terrific surprise. While I would rank this book below her true masterpieces, such as \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" or \\"The A.B.C. Murders,\\" I found it to be one of her most entertaining books.Christie spent some time in the Middle East with her archeologist husband and mined the setting for several earlier books, mostly featuring Hercule Poirot. This book is unusual both in not featuring one of her series detectives and in being a spy thriller rather than a murder mystery. It takes the form of a \\"North by Northwest\\" style thriller with an innocent person being swept up in a tale of international intrigue. The setting of Iraq must have seemed exotic and unfamiliar to readers in the U.S. and U.K. in 1951. Unfortunately, events of the last decade have made Baghdad, Basra, Kirkuk, and some of the other cities mentioned all too familiar. It's rather ironic to have the Iraq of those days described as well-policed and perfectly safe for a young Englishwoman to travel through alone.Although I very much enjoyed the book, it has a few weaknesses. Both the British intelligence service and its opponents seem fantastically well-organized and effective. Much more so than any real world spy service -- although this is a failing the book shares with most spy thrillers. in addition, key plot developments are telegraphed in a way that even I was able to pick up and I tend to be pretty weak in solving mysteries.In summary, while this book is far from the typical Christie, I think most of her fans, as well as fans of period spy thrillers, will find it very entertaining.One last point: I like these new Harper reprints. Although paperbacks, they can be read easily without breaking the binding and they should hold up to rereading. A word of warning, though, the blurb on the back cover gives away a plot point that doesn't occur until more than half way through the book!"},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Agatha Christie's immaculate stories make her a master of suspense and mystery. They Came to Baghdad is different from other Agatha Christie's other books - it's more of a thriller than a mystery. I have not read much of spy novels, just Alex Rider series and that does not come anywhere near Christie's ingenious plots. They Came To Baghdad does not have any high-tech machines or a gripping fight scenes, yet it is a book that the readers will find riveting and electrifying. The strong point of this book is the flawless story telling.For Victoria, the day has not started out well. She has been sacked from her job and does not have much cash to make up for her livelihood. That afternoon in the park, while pondering upon the unpleasant aspects of seeking a new job, she meets Edward. Just one meeting is enough for Victoria to fall head-over-heels for the dashing and polite Edward. Her luck unfortunately seems to have abandoned her as she finds out that he has to leave for Baghdad the very next day. Headstrong Victoria decides to follow the man she has fallen in love with to Baghdad, knowing only his first name and the firm he works in. However, once in Baghdad Victoria becomes embroiled in an international conspiracy when a dying man entrusts her with a message whose meaning she has no clue about. As her life is threatened and a plan to kidnap her is hatched by her rival for Edward's affections, Victoria finds herself getting more on her plate than she had asked for.They Came To Baghdad takes the reader through a roller coaster ride with its suspense, mystery, murder and conspiracy. The book does not centre on just Victoria, it has many characters popping up in almost each new chapter. Sometimes it becomes a bit difficult to keep track of all the different characters and to remember who the bad guy is and who the good one is. Nevertheless each character and the sub plots lead us back to the impetuous Victoria Jones. She may be mediocre in her chosen profession of a short hand typist but she is an excellent actress. Though many would call her a talented liar, she will just say that she is better at making things up than stating the plain truth. This gift of making up rather far-flung yet strangely believable lies do get her to Baghdad; nevertheless these lies come at a great price. At first, Victoria comes across as an airheaded woman who does not stop to think twice before making a rash decision. She has no control over what she says in public; this aspect of her nature makes her a magnet for trouble in Baghdad. She may have been silly following a man half way across the world whom she met for just a few hours and only whose first name is known to her, but it is her sharp perception and intuitive nature that comes in handy once she finds herself trapped in a conspiracy that threatens to topple the world peace. Victoria's plucky and dauntless nature makes her character hard not to adore.An exotic location, a mysterious message by a man who has been stabbed, an international conspiracy that threatens to start another world-war --They Came To Baghdad has everything you would want in a fast-paced thriller/mystery.Quotes:Victoria at any other moment would have been enchanted--nylon stockings having been usually beyond the reach of her purse. At the moment, however, hard cash was what she was hoping for. Mrs. Clipp, however, had been far too delicate to think of giving her a five dinar note. Victoria wished heartily that she had been quite so delicate.Victoria(an orphan) had just opened her mouth to explain how the plight of a mother at this moment suffering a major operation had so demoralized her that she had completely become light-headed, and how her small salary was all that the aforesaid mother had to depend upon, when, taking an opening glance at Mr. Greenholtz's unwholesome gace, she shut her mouth and changed her mind.She heard this time. With difficulty, great difficulty, the young man said two words. Whether she had heard them correctly or not Victoria did not know. They seemed to her quite nonsensical and without meaning.

If you are a fan of mystery novels and haven't read a book by this author - Shame on you! :D"},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" deviates from Christie's usual novels in that it fits into the spy and action genre although it still retains the best elements of her mysteries where a puzzling set of events remains unexplained until the end. It was written after her own trips to Baghdad with her second husband, Max Mallowan,an archaeologist. Two seemingly disparate stories get woven together. Anna Scheele, an American secretary for a bank, visits her sister in London and then mysteriously disappears. Vitoria Jones, a typist, accompanies a sick woman as a nurse to Baghdad and stays at the Hotel Tio. She gains knowledge of a murder and is kidnapped. The book is well worth reading to discover the end result and explanation.The Griffon Trilogy"},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" is not a Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple mystery. It is really more of a thriller. Victoria Jones, an indifferent London typist loses her job in a typing pool for impersonating her boss's wife and meets a charming young man in a park. Only, he is about to leave for Baghdad. Parting is such sweet sorrow! Not so, thinks Victoria. Undeterred by this obstacle to romance, the resourceful Londoner secures a job paying her passage out East. There she becomes embroiled in international espionage, is forced to flee people who are out to kill her, and finds herself working on an archeological dig. Christie writes in a mature and witty style. The descriptions of post WWII Baghdad and Basrah are fascinating, as are the fully-fleshed (for Christie) cast of characters. Does Victoria ultimately find love? Yes, but not where she expects it. A thoroughly absorbing read for any Christie fan.

This book could surprise the lambda reader who only read a couple of Agatha Christie books featuring Hercule Poirot or Mrs. Marple because THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD is pre-eminently a thriller with a non negligible dose of English humour in it. This reader could also be astonished by the quality of the descriptions of Baghdad and his surroundings written by an author not particularly well-known by his propensity to write long pages of description. If he is curious enough to read a few pages of Agatha Christie autobiography, he'll learn that Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan, an archaelogist, spent, after the end of WWII, long months in Iraq digging and hollowing. Hence, the meticulous descriptions found in this book I've enjoyed very much. Recommended.A book for the curious ones."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Victoria Jones is a recently fired shorthand typist with an elastic approach to telling the truth and a hankering for adventure. &quot;To Victoria an agreeable world would be one where tigers lurked in the Strand and dangerous bandits infested Tooting&quot;. She gets her chance at adventure when she meets Edward, a handsome young man on his way to Baghdad to work at an organisation called the Olive Branch, the purpose of which is to foster understanding between nations by getting young people of all countries together to read Shakespeare and Milton in translation. Victoria wishes she could go to Baghdad too, and by an amazing conicidence (or is it?) she is offered a job the very next day, to accompany a lady with a broken arm on the journey out. Victoria enterprisingly fakes herself some references, and claims to be the niece of Dr Pauncefoot Jones an archaeologist excavating at Basra. Victoria is enchanted by Baghdad, but before she has a chance to find Edward, a wounded man stumbles into her hotel room and dies there. Who is he? And who is the mysterious Mr Dakin? And what are the people at the Olive Branch really up to? And who on earth is Anna Scheele? Thi is an amusing and exciting story. Victoria is a delightful heroine, adventurous and imaginative and quite outrageously untruthful. There is an exciting plot and plenty of vivivd descriptions of Baghdad and other places, and lots of humour. Tremendous fun."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"For me, this book was somewhat of a disappointment, perhaps because, right before it, I had read And Then There Were None, which I thought was much better. However, that is not to say that this book was bad. It has plenty of humor(something that's hard to find in books where people get killed), and an amazing heroine. It is, though, farflung and a bit confusing."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"In a theme similar to some of her other works, namely the Big Four, the Secret Adversary, Destination Unknown and Seven Dials Mystery, Agatha Christie moved away from familiar settings of a murder/crime investigation within a confined setting to the global stage for an international conspiracy that sought to manipulate the 2 world powers in 1950. Such conspiracies were the favourite of writers like Robert Ludlum, fleshed out with all the dirt, cynicism and playing hardball, gratuouis sex and violence and profanity liberally sprinkled.Fortunately, or unfortunately, Christie's descriptions tend to be milder, child-like (or childish if you prefer) even. Bringing out a theme which she used a few times in other similar novels, the writer sought to try her hand into the realm of grand-scale conspiracy, extensive penetration of government officers by spies, huge amount of money movement camouflaged in indescripherable financial transaction, and missing scientists brought to a secret remote base far from civilisation.The readers were treated to a prologue scene where a couple of British agents were worried about a conference among the Great Powers to be conducted in Baghdad soon. Their man who had on a rumour gone off in pursuit of evidence of the conspiracy was on the way back but the path is hindered by people who sought to silence him and the evidence at all costs.The scene officially opened with Victoria Jones, orphaned, typical working girl in a London office whose only escape from her dreary existence was inventing juicy tales, the type of juiciness that could only come from the subject being related to familiar characters, such as her boss. Thus when her boss returned early unexpectedly, Victoria Jones found herself shortly munching her lunch in FitzJames Garden, considering her externally imposed career revision.Not the type of girl to let such things depress her, Victoria Jones found herself attracted to a man sitting nearby. Boldly introducing herself to him, Edward charmed her by the simplistic way he reflected on life, universe and everything, probably very much like what Wodehouse's Bertram Wooster would say in candid guiless moments. After Edward took a snapshot of her before rushing off back to his boss, letting out that he was bound for Baghdad the following day, it took Victoria Jones all of a minute or so before deciding she too would go to Baghdad, with her exchequer being of a respectable sum of five pounds, or so.With the kind of serendipitous encounters that could only happen in the movies & PG Wodehouse, Victoria Jones made her way Baghdad, a comfortable trip, legal and all without stowing away like rats on a ship, and with just a bit of the madcap hare-brained (yet undeniably successful) schemes that PG Wodehouse put his poor heroines through. Victoria had to through becoming several different people before arriving in the Middle East and finding Edward. The encounters she had in her journey would serve to provide her with the information later she would need when she found herself involved in the BIG conspiracy.For a change, her first involvement was not due to any of her doing. A man simply got into her room, begged for sanctuary like the room was the Church of Notre Dame in Paris, then most inconsiderately, died. A nearby British agent quickly assisted her through the crisis, and Victoria Jones found herself off in search for clues at the Olive Branch, a literary society where Edward was employed.The mystery deepened when Victoria Jones was kidnapped at the arrangement of a colleague who was just as besotted with Edward. Though she was just an amateur blundering in the dark, Victoria showed herself no less resourceful by escaping, taking on more identities before returning to the Baghdad.Readers can't help but admire her quick-thinking and acting skills when she finally discovered that the truth was ...For its merits, readers would have to consider this book as being about Victoria Jones and how she handled herself through sticky situations, instead of viewing this as a mystery or a thriller."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"This is a pretty good book all the way around. The first part features Victoria, who, on chance meeting the man of her dreams, designs to follow him half-way around the world. Getting completely mixed up in danger, she determines to find out the truth. This, of course, means that everything she once thought was the truth turns completely around in a tangle of lies and deception. See if you can guess the antagonist...it's a classic Christie ending. It's really not too bad a book."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"Absolutely the most enjoyable AC novel I've ever read (and I've read almost all of them). It's got all the elements of an over-the-top spy novel, but with the flair for psychology and setting of Agatha Christie. It's great escapist entertainment, and the description of Baghdad as it once was (and probably never will be again) is not to be missed."},{"Title":"They Came to Baghdad","review":"While many Agatha Christie stalwarts would prefer Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot better, I found &quot;They Came to Baghdad&quot; to be entertaining and a delight! Combining murder mystery with all the unexpected twists of a spy novel, the story is remains grounded in the every-day character of Victoria Jones. Also, don't miss out on the mid-20th century depiction of the Arab lands. I highly recommend this novel to fans of Agatha Christie, or even fans of the TV show Alias (correlations between Victoria and Sydney abound)!"},{"Title":"Hunky: The Immigrant Experience","review":"The title of this book is quite provocative! \\"Hunky\\" is a term of derision and disparagement that was given to the Rusyn people at the time that they first came to the United States from villages north and south of the Carpathian Mountain range in Eastern Europe. The word \\"Hunky\\" is derived from the name of the country from which many of them came, i.e.-Hungary. They were also referred to as \\"Huns\\" as seen in the headlines of newspapers of the 1880's in America in describing the behavior of the striking miners in Latimer, Pa. The headlines trumpeted: \\"HUNS BURN AND RUN WILD IN THE STREETS\\". The author of \\"HUNKY\\" may have purposefully used the word to stimulate and provoke potential readers. The term has usually represented the low esteem in which our people were held when they first came to America starting in the last decades of the 19th century. However, we are no longer called \\"Hunkys\\"! It is now a term that is seldom heard. Indeed, we are quite proud of our parents and grandparents who were once called \\"Hunkys, no matter what they were called. We take pride in their accomplishments and are thankful for what they have passed on to us in our own accomplishments. I believe that the word \\"Hunky\\" is now a badge of honor for what our Rusyn ancestors and we have accomplished. It has taken an author with the stature and reputation of Nick Karas to boldly use the term as the title of his book which describes the struggles of these people to overcome the poverty and servitude that they had faced for centuries in the villages of northeastern Austria Hungary. Karas is a noted scientist, journalist and author who has written dozens of books and hundreds of magazine articles and newspaper columns. He has been on the Staff and written for TRUE, ARGOSY, and other magazines. \\"HUNKY\\" is his first published novel which he wrote as a result of a suggestion by James Michener that he write about \\"something that he knew\\". Indeed, he certainly knows our people! \\"HUNKY\\" is a story of the lives and struggles of Karas' ancestors from two villages in the Carpathian Mountains - Prostisne north of the Carpathians in present day Poland and Vilag to the south in Slovakia. He relies on the stories that he heard from his grandparents and on his own recollections of their lives in America which were first in the coal mines of southwestern Pa. and then to the shoe factories of Binghamton, New York and the mills of Johnstown and Ambridge, Pa. as the mines no longer required their cheap labor. It is a story that is similar to those of thousands of our people who had the courage and fortitude to immigrate to America and eventually to realize their and their children's economic, social and educational ambitions. Karas describes in graphic detail how our people were solicited by agents of U.S. companies to work in the mines in America and how they were escorted to the docks of transatlantic steamship companies in Germany. They were fed and housed and examined and approved for their dangerous and painful voyage across the ocean to New York's harbor and the long train ride to their eventual destination near Johnstown, Pa. The dialogue created by the author gave me a vivid picture of a similar voyage of my own paternal grandparents to the United States in 1895. I now have more than the ship manifests of Ellis Island on the internet to rely upon. \\"HUNKY\\" permits me to re-live more vividly their journey from Bremen. The author grew up the Rusyn communities when there was great religious strife among our people over the celibacy issue. Families and friendships were split and broken. There was bitterness in Binghamton and Johnstown and Ambridge amongst the \\"Hunkys\\". It was his generation and mine that lived through that era. Karas describes other poignant and bitter times: the funeral of his great grand father; his own father's death at the age of three; the struggles of his widowed mother; the plight of alcoholism upon the \\"Hunkies\\"; his life on his grandfather's farm; the impact of the two world wars and the death and destruction during the Nazi and communist regimes and occupation. The book ends with a description of his visit to his two ancestral villages and the chance and tearful meeting with his 103 year old uncle who had returned to his village from America when his wife refused to travel across the ocean. He ended his life as a virtual hermit. The 501 pages of \\"HUNKY\\" are filled with such history and pathos. Some critics may have questions about the author's viewpoint on the Rusyn v. Ukrainian debate. The book is multifaceted; but whether it is a novel, or a history or a biography or a memoir is not important. There is no doubt, however, that anyone who is interested in the lives and history of our Rusyn people during the past one hundred and twenty five years would have much to remember, to learn and to understand by reading this book. Hopefully, a century from now, others will still remember this as well as other accounts of the lives of the \\"Hunkys\\". The book is available through Amazon.com.BY Orestes J.

The section on working in the coal mines and the shoe factories was extremely compelling and correct, right down to the names and locations of the \\"beer gardens\\" on Clinton Street in Binghamton, NY.I will give copies of this book to each of my grown children, so that they can have a historical record of what their ancestors did and how they lived, as seen through the author's family.As a teenager and young man in the Binghamton area (and still today at age 62 in New England) I describe myself as a \\"Hunky\\", and if a fellow-Slavic person called me that, I would not be insulted.

This book will appeal to anyone with family roots in Eastern Europe. Especially those who have Grandparents and Great Grandparents who left their ancient homeland in search of a new life and crossed the storm tossed waters of the Atlantic Ocean in search of this dream called America.Many Americans have immigrant ancestors who crossed over from Europe but I will bet many have never stopped to understand what courage, commitment and even loss that those people had to endure to do start again in a new land. Nicholas Karas uses his family history and stories to explain this to his readers in great detail. From starvation and desperation in Galicia to vomit filled steerage aboard the ocean liners bringing them to America. Then the novelty of arrival and harsh reality of the mines and mills that absorbed the lives and dreams of these people. Our people.For me, I felt a connection since my family immigrated from Slovakia in 1903. I now have a much better idea of what it must have been like for them to leave everything they knew for a dream. No internet, phone, TV or Radio. No planes, color photos and few cars. Most of them could barely read or write if at all, yet they took those fateful steps out of the fields of Eastern Europe, boarded the ships like human cattle to brave an ocean and chase the dream of America. Simply amazing. Mr. Karas has given me a vividly detailed look into my Great Grandfather's life and the sacrifice he made so that me and my family live the life we do now rather than the same one he lived.

I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand the why and how of their ancestors greatest journey."},{"Title":"Hunky: The Immigrant Experience","review":"Most definitely, you can't go home again, especially if you are Ukranian, descended from those who lived in Galicia, Austria Hungary. This story will not be of interest to everyone, but it gives great background for those interested in learning what prompted those Eastern Europeans to leave their country, come to the USA and settle near the coal mines and steel mills in Pennsylvania and similar places. It describes their lives and the reasons that many went back and forth from one country to another until they no longer could do so. The feelings of sadness and satisfaction that Mr. Karas experienced when trying to locate the village his ancestors left are very easy to understand. I am so greatful that he took the time to give us this bit of history in such a personal way.

He's done a lot of research to provide these perspectives and it greatly enhances the story of his family. If any of these are your background I definitely recommend you get and read this book.It's difficult for me to explain what an impact this book had on me.

My widowed mother worked in the Endicott Johnson shoe factories to raise her three children. I was born and grew up in the First Ward of Binghamton, New York. We lived on Baxter Street where Mr. Karas's family attended St. Mary's church.I'm sure at times it must have been difficult for Mr. Karas to write some of his family history.

The term means nothing to me because I'm a third generation American but I understand the derogatory meaning of it and how insulting it must have been.This book was well written and had such rich detail. It spans the Rusyns in the old country, describing their hardships and their decisions to give it a go in America. I loved the chapters describing the journey across the ocean - it was so well detailed that one could almost feel seasick. The author probably did many years of family research and it shows. It was a little confusing to me because there were so many people intertwined in the story. A family tree in the back of the book would have been helpful.Some of the book was very sad but it reminds you that in every family there are bad endings and mistakes made. Overall I think this book was hopeful and I was rooting for them at every step. It is a story about making your own American dreams come true.

Doctrow's poignant look at Depression era gangsterism through the eyes of the young boy after whom the book is named. Much to Doctrow's credit, there is no sentimentalizing or romanticizing of criminals here. Almost legendary gangster, Dutch Schultz, who befriends Billy, is depicted clearly as a vicious, sadistic thug teetering on the edge of insanity.Although it is the Dutchman who takes in the boy, Billy is drawn to Dutch's moll sexually, and to the gang's bookkeeper, Otto Berman, emotionally. Otto is the real key to the book. Billy, like Johnson's Boswell, is drawn to the accountant and his philosophy. Broken down, Otto explains to the boy that things like love, loyalty, knowledge, and spirit are meaningless--none of them can be proven. They are all bound by words. To Otto, words are just words. Numbers, however, are the only true language. One and one will always be two. Numbers never lie. (Spoken like a true accountant.) This has an enormous impact on a young boy whose mother is one step away from the nuthouse, and whose father took off years earlier.I gave this book four stars because I had just finished re-reading RAGTIME, and this came up a little short. On the other hand, maybe RAGTIME was too high a standard to hold it up to. In any event, this is not your typical gangster novel, as I hope this review has made apparent. It is a complex and profound book and should satisfy the most literary appetite.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Rarely does an award-winning work of literature read as easily as a Michael Crichton paperback. If you are in the mood for a quick read, you would normally turn to the pop fiction selections on your bookshelf and find something mindless and plot driven. If you are looking for a higher level of quality, such as a Pen/Faulker Award winner, you perhaps consciously prepare yourself for the added effort that reading a meaningful, elaborate, character-driven novel entails. You will almost certainly be rewarded for the effort, but it is an effort nonetheless. But in Billy Bathgate, E.L. Doctorow blends the depth, substance, and beauty of a quality work of literature with the pace, suspense, and rhythm of a mafia thriller. The result is an imminently readable novel that is also an important contribution to 20th century fiction.The plot itself bears much resemblance to countless other mafia stories, filled with shady characters, ruthless hit men, brutal murders, bribing of government officials, and steamy love affairs. The uniqueness lies in the fact that the narrator is a 15-year-old boy, Billy, eager to earn the trust of Dutch Schultz, the mafia kingpin, and his gang. He quickly progresses from simple errand boy, buying cigarettes and coffee, to a position of modest responsibility in this intriguing world of crime. Through Billy's somewhat nave, innocent eyes, we observe Dutch as he manages his empire, carries out hits against his enemies and disloyal employees, and struggles to evade the attempts of law enforcement to bring him down. The story takes us from New York City to Onondoga, a small town where Dutch's trial eventually takes place. And in the process, we witness the growth of a boy into a young man as he enters a world of big money, intense loyalty, and vindictive violence. Throughout, Doctorow's beautiful prose, gift for understatement, and masterful sense of timing create a remarkable novel that will linger in the reader's mind long after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"An excellent tale of an aspiring young street tough's initiation into the dangers and excitment of the gangster life, circa the 1930's, this book captures its era and the personalities it portrays with an astonishing verve and veracity. The tone and \\"voice\\" feel right, speeding along brilliantly, while the tale, of a young fellow's awakening from gawking naivete to a certain street-smart cynicism, rings remarkably true. If there is a reason for reading fiction today, BILLY BATHGATE offers the perfect example: it is a means for carrying us into places and times now long gone which still may resonate in the contemporary soul. While the hero is a trifle too cloying for my tastes and seems rather more inured to the moral chaos he sees around him than his apparent sensibility suggests he should be, this is, finally, a small fault to find with such a deflty turned tale. Progressing from a 15-year old loner on street corners to mascot of the Dutch Schultz gang, as they hurtle down the spiral of their final decline, the self-named Billy Bathgate insinuates himself into the precarious confidences of this remakably unstable crew. Schultz, himself, the erratic gang leader, has already slipped into a dangerous condition of paranoia and isolation and his hangers-on live from moment to moment in fearful unease, unable to check the excesses of their leader or to separate themselves from him. Billy finds their life oddly mesmerizing as he gets sucked into witnessing outbursts of murder and coldly planned gangland executions, until his role brings him into the orbit of a flighty, if beautiful, society doll. Then a burgeoning adolescent crush seems to awaken him to what he has done and, as in a dream, he begins to seek a way out. The ending comes swiftly and will surprise those who have not yet seen the movie (which captures much, but not all, of the written tale). And yet the wrap-up is a little bit of a let-down (rather too pat, actually) and I longed to know more of who and what this Billy turned out to be. Yet, on balance, this was a fine novel and evidence, indeed, for the solid reputation Doctorow has earned.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Its not easy to grow up without a role model. This book is about the need for a boy, Billy, trying to find himself while growing up in a poor neighborhood in New York. Billy's character was a symbol similar to the character Holden Caulfield in the book Catcher and the Rye but the difference between the two characters was that Billy was a little bit less in control of his destiny and was led on more in this story.The character Billy becomes wrapped up in a gang led by an alcohol smuggler, Dutch Schultz, by doing menial tasks. But also he witnesses something brutal with the execution of one of Dutch's betrayers. Doctorow uses the naivety of Billy to accentuate the emotional scenes in the book and the execution in the beginning is merely one example.Billy is also expressed as an outcast from society trying to find himself a feel like he belongs somewhere. And that is how he gets wrapped up in the gang and never thinks twice about it. He most importantly wants Dutch to like him for its own sake. Other characters in the book are in the gang for ulterior motives from the accountant to the grunts and drivers, that's to be expected. But for Billy, he just wants to be liked.I thought that the scenes were pretty enjoyable. It's similar to the book of \\"The Catcher and the Rye\\" and the famous film \\"The Graduate\\" starring Dustin Hoffman who I believe is in the movie version of this book. Reading this book will make you think like a teenager and might even bring back some memories you might have of being unsure of yourself or wanting to be accepted within a group. It should take a week to a couple of weeks depending on the time in your reading sessions."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Set in 1935, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; tells the story of how its title character, a 15-year-old street kid from the Bronx, apprentices himself to one of the most formidable gangsters in New York. Thomas E. Dewey, the special public prosecutor of New York who later was to run for president against Roosevelt and Truman, is making a name for himself by going after mob figures, and Dutch Schultz is one of his prime targets. Dutch's gang is involved in the operation of breweries, nightclubs, and labor unions, and they're not shy about disposing of their enemies through symbolically gruesome means, as we see what happens to two scab window washers. To evade taxes they launder their money through a small town upstate called Onondaga.Billy becomes attracted to the flamboyant gang and slowly ingratiates his way inside by doing small jobs for them. Besides the charismatic but tragic Dutch, other members include the friendly Otto Berman, who loves playing with numbers and becomes Billy's fatherly mentor, the brutish muscle Lulu, the silently perceptive Irving, and Mickey the driver. Billy narrates in the first person with a unique voice, using run-on sentences that display his enthusiasm to be playing with the big boys.The novel begins &quot;in medias res&quot; with a scene of one of Dutch's disloyal henchmen being fitted for a pair of cement shoes. The man's girlfriend, a voluptuous high-society blonde with a complicated private life, becomes Dutch's moll, and Dutch gives Billy the assignment to keep her company when the gang hides out in Onondaga for the summer. Eventually Billy realizes that her life might be in danger as a possible witness to her ex-boyfriend's murder, and one of the best parts of the novel is his clever plan to get her out of harm's way. In the novel's tense climax, Dutch plots to assassinate Dewey, an event which, if carried out, would certainly change the course of history as we know it.As in &quot;Ragtime,&quot; Doctorow is eminently able to evoke a romantic but realistic New York City of a time long past that perhaps was quieter but not necessarily more innocent sexually or morally. Doctorow obviously enjoys using the city and figures from history as a canvas on which to create his fiction, and his joy is infectious to the reader. I certainly wish I could have spent a teenage summer having Billy's experiences. Invoking the excitement of a boyhood adventure in an entirely original milieu, written with maturity and panache, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; is a novel Mark Twain would have saluted."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I recently finished Billy Bathgate, so the book is still fresh in my mind. I have to say, as a first-time reader of Doctorow, that I was not disappointed, and that I was definitely surprised. The surprise stemmed, probably, from the fact that I rarely read 'modern' authors. I find their work too cookie-cutter, lacking in imagery and effective language,extremely forgettable, and one dimensional. Well, Doctorow is none of these things. Personally, I don't think I will ever forget Billy Bathgate. The title character himself is too engaging to be forgotten, too understandable, human, and too deserving of just the right amounts of sympathy and exasperation. His narrative invokes memories of Holden Caulfield, Nick Carraway, and strangely enough, Dr. Watson. Doctorow peppers his text with delightful run-ons, sentence fragments, and old-fashioned American profanity. I say delightful because all three of these classic no-no's are incorporated perfectly into the words coming out of Billy's mouth and from his memory. Perfect grammar would be undesirable in this case, because Billy thinks in fragments and acts in run-ons. I think we would miss out on half of his personality and being if he didn't come across as a boy made out of the broken pieces of one big, dangling participle. Don't let reviews dissing the grammar deter you from reading this book, I suppose I'm trying to say. The imagery is beautiful, the descriptions (especially of people, but also of places, smells, buildings, scenes,) are sheer perfection. They hit the nail on the head. Sit back and watch the mental movie your mind will unfold for you. This is one of those books that will give you End-Of-Book-Withdrawal.I'm very much looking forward to reading Doctorow's other works."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Coming of age story meets historical fiction meets old timey true crime in this relatively absorbing tale of the waning months of legendary New York gangster Dutch Schultz. Set in 1934-35, the story is narrated by a poor, 15-year-old, Irish-Catholic dropout from the tenements of the East Bronx. Like all the other boys his age, Billy lives in awe of the city's big-time gangsters, and Schultz's money, charisma, and fame are powerful lures. Although Billy is fatherless and his mother is more than slightly unhinged, he's ambitious, and so manages to make himself useful as a gopher at Schultz's numbers-running headquarters, where he catches the eye of Otto Berman, Schultz's cerebral right-hand man.As Schultz's small empire of booze, broads, numbers, and extortion starts to crumble under pressure from the feds and more powerful competitors, Billy evolves from mascot to trusted intimate -- especially after witnessing the Schultz's murder of one of his main henchmen in a scene that results in Schultz's appropriation of the man's moll as his own. The moll turns out to be a kind of young society dame out for kicks, and as the gang lies low in the upstate town of Onondaga, she and Billy develop a secret friendship that implausibly turns torridly sexual. What's nice about the book is that Billy isn't a thoughtless foot soldier, but understands Schultz's temperament and increasing instability, and is honest in tempering the glamorous side of the kingpin's with a clear view of his brutality and excesses. And though Billy can't see an immediate exit for himself (nor does he especially want one), he does recognize that if the woman doesn't leave, she's in great danger. The highlight of the book is his scheme to engineer her separation from Schultz without letting her, or anyone in the gang onto what he's doing.Doctorow does an excellent job of showing the disintegration of the gang and of Schultz himself, as the inner circle stoically stands firm on what is clearly a sinking ship. In the final section, Schultz is under attack from special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (the future presidential candidate), and Billy is sent to follow him and work out a plan for his assassination. This sets the stage for a gripping ending which includes a classic gangland slaying, a meeting with Lucky Luciano, and Billy's attempt to make off with Schultz's rather substantial cash reserve. Which is not to say the book is a mere crime thriller -- there are strong running themes concerning identity and the American mythology of the self-made man. There's also Billy's quest for a father figure, not to mention his sexual awakening, loss of innocence, and more. Doctorow's prose is perhaps a little too restrained and the dialogue veers somewhat toward speechifying at times, but on the whole it reads well. The characterization is fairly vivid, although it's hard to stay away from the usual gangster and Depression-era stereotypes. Billy is somewhat problematic, a 15-year-old with altogether to much perception of the adult world around him. Of course, without this perception, there is no book, and this is a kind of necessary evil one comes across all too often in fiction narrated by teenagers and written by adults. It's a good book,but not a great one, and perhaps of greatest interest to those interested in New York of the mid-'30s."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"EL Doctrow's talent with language is a step or two or three or four beyond that of the average scrivener. And even of the somewhat above average scrivener. Most of us aspire to prose as good as his without ever quite achieving it. But sometimes in this book he is a bit undisciplined in the application of his talent, and gets himself in trouble as a result. It's evident right from the first chapter, when passages like this:\\"He had to have planned it because when we drove onto the dock the boat was there and the engine was running and you could see the water churning up phosphorescence in the river, which was the only light there was because there was no moon, nor no electric light either in the shack where the dockmaster should have been sitting, nor on the boat itself, and certainly not from the car, yet everyone knew where everything was....\\"...and this:\\"But anyway I wasn't thinking of any of this at the time, it was just something I had in me I could use if I had to, not even an idea but an instinct waiting in my brain in case I ever needed it, or else why would I have leapt lightly over the rail...\\"...establish his protagonist Billy Bathgate as a capable, savvy, and colloquially eloquent street urchin. Then, a few pages later, we get this:\\"I think now that the key to grace or elegance in any body, male or female, is the length of the neck, that when the neck is long several conclusions follow, such as a proper proportion of weight to height, a natural pride of posture, a gift for eye contact, a certain nimbleness of the spine and length of stride, all in all a kind of physical gladness in movement leading to athletic competence or a love for dancing. Whereas the short neck predicts a host of metaphysical afflictions, any one of which brings about the ineptitude for life that creates art, invention, great fortunes, and the murderous rages of the disordered spirit.\\"Those of you familiar with Mark Twain's hilarious evisceration of James Fenimore Cooper's literary offenses in \\"The Deerslayer\\" will recognize the problem. For those who aren't, think specifically of Twain's Rule #7:\\"They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven- dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel in the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the 'Deerslayer' tale.\\"Doctrow violates this rule too. Not as egregiously as Cooper, and not within one paragraph, and from the bottom up rather than the top down, but he still violates it. I'd have given Billy Bathgate a four or even five star rating if he'd been more consistent in his management of character voice."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"E.L.

Young Billy Bathgate rides his coattails on a downward spiral as Dutch by the time period of this book is a man gasping for breath and clawing for air as New York City and the infamous DA Thomas Dewey are closing in seeking to destroy Dutch and his dwindling gangster empire.This is a fictionalized account much like \\"Legs,\\" by William Kennedy. \\"Leg's,\\" tale was dished up by Jack Diamond's lawyer and this tale is witnessed by a young boy, Billy Bathgate, who hooks up with Schultz's mob as an errand boy and tries to make his own way upward in the New York City mob.There is a lot to like in this novel. The portrayal of Dutch Schultz is vivid and brimming with descriptions of a loud mad man with a violent temper surrounded by his faithful (pretty much) henchmen. Dutch was off the cuff and there is more than one grisly scene of him beating or killing a man because he just could not control his temper and the rest of the gang always had to contend with the aftermath of his rampages. Billy Bathgate is just a kid witnessing the ins and out of gangster life trying to pull his weight so he can become just like them. It's a good thing he is smart, otherwise he'd not last long, but as is the case he is a great character that this story follows through a suffering city full of heartbreak and triumph.The members of Dutch's gang are all present, in one form or another, such as: Otto (Abbadabba) Biederman, Dutch's financial planner who was a complete whiz with numbers, Lulu Rosenkrantz, the cold blooded killer, Michael O'Hanley, the driver, Bo Weinburg, who's unforgettable role starts off the novel, and many more characters who graced Depression Era New York City with blood, guts, and glory.This is an engaging tale of rags to riches, gun battles and coldbooded ruthless determination during a time when men could rise to power with a gang of devotees and a tommy gun to create his own reality and his own horrific downfall. If you enjoy reading about gangster hideouts, gun molls, illegal gambits and murdering gangsters in New York City during the depression, you'll enjoy this story. Equally memorable is Dutch's soliliquy which in history was a memorable speech that enthralled the media and G men alike with it's stream of consciousness rambling as though it contained important clues to the inside workings of a self-made mobster's livlihood and fortunes and the crimes that were committed to gain them. This alone definately makes the book worth an afternoon's read.This is a remarkably readable book. E.L Doctrow's talents are present on every page and in every gruesome or otherwise depiction of Dutch Schultz's and Billy Bathgate's engrossing story."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"We've all read scores of stories in which a young, spunky kid makes his way up the criminal ladder with his wit and little tricks...but this is by Doctorow, so it's done better than most. The book contains some of the standard themes inherent in the drama -- the thugs, the incredibly sexy woman that no one can resist, betrayal, and death. However, it often defies expectations and leads the reader to really share with Billy's emotions. All the scenes, whether they be about torture, sex, familial love, or childish musings, connect to universal emotions.The only problem I had with this book was the ending. I was thoroughly enjoying it and unable to focus on my work until I finished but towards the very end it just got...unimpressive. While everything did wrap up well, it seemed more like an easy or expected conclusion than one that was original and fitting to the characters themselves.

Although all of Doctorow's books are \\"readable\\", meaning not falling asleep after reading each chapter, i feel that Billy Bathgate clearly stands out among these stories.The story is told through a seventeen year old boy and his life experiences in his neighborhood and in a gang. I found the plot to be extremely exciting in a few places in the book, meaning more than one climax, and it also described the harsh reality of poverty in the early 20th century. To accent this, each scene was described with intracate detail, and seriously, i had trouble putting this one down.My opinion may be biased, as i am seventeen myself, but i found that i could remarkably relate to many feelings Billy experienced. So if you are seventeen also, or if you are just interested in an exhilerating story, i strongly recommend Billy Bathgate over any other book written by Doctorow."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"E.L. Doctorow's descriptive historical fiction follows a period of time during the formative years of young Billy Bathgate a 15 year old fatherless street kid from the ghettoes of the Bronx. The time is the mid 1930's with the U.S. in the throes of the Depression. The advent of prohibition assured that gangsterism ruled the urban landscape.Bathgate who lived in a squalid and tiny tenement apartment with his mentally unbalanced Irish Catholic mom was hanging out on the streets doing juggling tricks at which he was adept. He unwittingly came to be noticed by the notorious mobster Dutch Schultz. Intrigued by the aura of the powerful crime boss, Bathgate soon ingratiated himself to the truculent Schultz. He became and errand boy and good luck charm to the gang. Nurtured under the wing of the fostering Otto \\"Abbadabba\\" Berman, the financial brains of the organization, Bathgate soon had both Schultz and Berman as father figures to esteem. Even at such a tender age he managed to discern both the good and evil in his surrogate fathers.Doctorow begins his novel on a tugboat in New York harbor. Bathgate has secreted himself aboard to witness the dispatching of a previously trustworthy lieutenant of Schultz, Bo Weinberg. Weinberg was being fitted for cement shoes and had been accompanied by a lovely young married socialite Drew Preston. Preston also aboard belowdecks would become Schultz's moll. Bathgate, now a trusted gang member, was commissioned with the duty of being Preston's protector.Schultz, being pursued for prosecution by among others Thomas E. Dewey, successfully petitioned the courts to move his trial to bucolic upstate Onondaga. The gang including Bathgate and Preston take up summer residence there with Schultz running his various illegal businesses by proxy. Schultz acting as the civic minded model citizen is positively influencing the town who will be his jury. As the trial approaches Berman at Schultz's request orders Bathgate to accompany Preston to Saratoga to get her out of the way. As a result of this episode, they have an affair. The lovesick Bathgate protects her from what he fears will be an assassination as she potentially becomes a liability in Schultz's eyes.The story follows further episodes of the inner workings of Schultz gang and Bathgates maturation under the guidance of his mentor Berman. Doctorow's finale assures that evil will be punished yet Bathgate is saved by his ability to recognize the difference between right and wrong and shelter himself from trouble.Doctorow is extremely accomplished in this genre of historical fiction. His expressive articulate descriptions of his settings is his trademark. He successfully manages to tranform fact into plausible intriguing storytelling with well developed and often ambiguous, conflicted characters."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Much of E.L Doctorow's finest writing celebrates the vibrancy, brashness, and diversity of New York City. Doctorow's novels also show a fascination with secular Jews -- with individuals who abandon traditional Jewish religious practice and adopt various other types of life. Thus, \\"The Book of Daniel\\" explores New York City in the 1940s in a historical novel based upon the Rosenbergs. Doctorow's remarkable novel, \\"City of God,\\" explores contemporary New York City in the context of secular Jews and of highly liberal Jews who have adopted beliefs and practices far different from traditional Judaism.In \\"Billy Bathgate\\", Doctorow offers an unforgettable picture of gangland New York City and of Jewish mobsters dominated by the figure of Dutch Schultz, as Doctorow takes the reader away from the humdrum everyday and into a world of rawness, danger, and excitement. Life needs its dangers and risks, Doctorow seems to be telling the reader, if it is not to be stupyfing, dull, and conventional.\\"Billy Bathgate\\" is a coming-of-age story set in the New York City underworld of the 1930s. The book is told in the first person by its hero, the fifteen-year old Billy (who takes the name \\"Bathgate\\" from the chief commercial street in the East Bronx) who becomes attached to the gang led by the notorious Dutch Schultz (1902 -- 1935), born Arthur Flegenheimer to a poor Jewish family in the Bronx. The book is told in a breathy, highly excitable and emotive style appropriate to the voice of its young, naive protagonist. Billy's father had disappeared when the boy was young, and Billy lives with his poor, at best marginally sane mother. He seems destined for a life of petty thievery and cheap tawdry sex until Dutch Schultz notices the boy juggling on a street corner near a beer drop-off. Billy ingratiates himself with the Schultz gang in its declining days. Schultz becomes a father-figure to Billy. Schultz basks in the attention he receives from the boy and in his public notoriety.Doctorow has written a richly-textured historical novel which shows us New York City and the gangland world. While the reader comes to understand and sympathize with Billy, Doctorow does not allow the reader to lose site of the random viciousness of gangland life. There are scenes of shocking violence and killing, the most fully developed of which involves the murder of Schultz' former associate, Bo Weinberg. Dutch Schultz in all his brutality and intensity come to life in this book as do the members of his inner circle. His chief lieutenant, Otto Berman, known as \\"Abadabba\\" Berman, a mathematical genius, becomes a mentor to Billy and is one of the most sharply-drawn characters in the novel. At great peril to himself, Billy becomes involved with Schultz' final mistress. This affair becomes the focal point of his coming to a degree of self-understanding. Rival gangs and New York officialdom, including District Attorney Thomas Dewey also receive a rich portrayal.Much of the symbolism of the book revolves around the use of words and of change, as Billy Bathgate, Abadabba Berman, and Dutch Schultz, among others, adopt names not their own. Billy's skill at juggling, which appears at many points in the book, becomes a metaphor for the importance of adopting to change and of being light on one's feet if one is to succeed in the world. As Berman counsels Billy in many of their astonishing conversations, only the numbers are real while words change. Religion, and Jewish-Christian relations play a role in this book as well, illustrating the theme of constant change, as Dutch Schultz appears to convert from Judaism to Catholicism late in the novel. The book captures the fast-paced, slangy style of speech of its protagonists and includes as well heady, striking, and detailed passages of description.This is a tough-minded novel, a gripping read, and, in its own way, an inspring tale. \\"Billy Bathgate\\" is an unforgettable work by one of the United States' major living storytellers.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I read somewhere that in BILLY BATHGATE Doctorow was writing a myth about capitalism, which seems about right. Doctorow is one of the few historical novelists who has something significant to say about American history and doesn't just appropriate famous historical figures to give their books marketing value (yes, I'm talking about BLONDE, by Joyce Carol Oates.) This book is pretty great. If you haven't read it, you'll enjoy it. If you like a good read -- interesting characters, humour, vivid imagery, and a suspenseful plot -- you'll love it. If you're interested in literary form and ideological engagement (like the capitalism comment above) you'll also enjoy it. This seems to be Doctorow's strength -- combining good old-fashioned narrative with serious literary critique in a way that should make Tom Wolfe jealous. The opening, where the gangster gets his feet cemented, sets a dazzling tone for the rest of the novel, and this is one book that keeps getting better as it goes on. Buy this one and enjoy."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"In Billy Bathgate, Doctorow writes a coming of age book about a 15-year-old boy from the Bronx. The story is set in the late 20's and early 30's. Billy, for all practical purposes, is an orphan who grows up on the tenement-lined streets. His life changes when he ingratiates himself with a local mobster named Dutch Schultz.Billy, at first, runs simple errands; gathering coffee and donuts and delivering money. Dutch, however, likes the kid and starts to train him for future endvours. Billy likes the money but soon realizes he is in thicker than he wants to be. However, the Mafia is his family and there can be no escape. The book takes Billy through the dangerous and exciting rise and fall of Dutch's empire.Doctorow writes a compelling novel in the sense that Doctorow has done his homework. There is a sense of authenticity when reading the historical and scenic descriptions. Billy's love scenes and the gritty action were described almost poetically. However, what turned me off was the writing itself. Too many run on sentences and often times I found that the scene changed, often radically, without any help to the reader. It was like a page or paragraph was missing. While the characters were colorful and interesting, I didn't have as much sympathy with Billy as I would have hoped. There is some sexual content, so young readers should be cautioned. Otherwise a pretty good story, especially if you like this historical era."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Just finished reading this again after many years. What a wonderful story of a boy's fascination from afar with the criminal life and a charismatic killer, and his changing perceptions as he gets up close. The writing is beautiful, the characters--especially Billy and Drew--wonderfully realized in every way, and the story exciting and meaningful. Just a fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Doctorow's early works seem to rely to heavily on literary gimmicks, which is sad, because his writing could stand on its own, without having to resort to trickery.Here, he seems to have a phobia of the quotation mark, which I secretly believe was due to a malfunctioning typewriter he owned at the time.The same thing happened to e.e. cummings - broken shift key. It's true. Look it up.Much of the dialog occurs not as quotes but as statements, or long run-on sentences.This distorted prose makes the book a bit hard to get into initially, and leaves one feeling a bit dizzy. But perhaps that was the intended effect.Overall, a good story without a lot of the political overtones that he puts in his other books."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I had read \\"The March\\" and \\"Ragtime,\\" so I figured \\"Billy Bathgate\\" would be excellent, and it was. On the surface, it's a simple story of the last few months of gangster Dutch Schultz's life. But Doctorow tells the story through the eyes of Billy Bathgate, a teenager who gets in with Schultz's gang as a go-fer. Doctorow's writing is, as always, superb, and more than just a recitation of facts, going deeply into the gangsters' world and their behaviors, and how they operated within society.I'm still not sure if Billy Bathgate was based on a real person or if he is entirely fictional, but telling the story through his experiences as a lesser member of the gang allowed an inside look at Schultz without disturbing the facts.A very readable and fascinating look into the New York crime scene of the 1930's."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I know it seems odd to refer to a &quot;gangster&quot; novel as &quot;beautiful,&quot; but Billy Bathgate is just that. Gorgeous imagery, writing more poetry than prose, with beautiful human touches that stand outside the storyline itself, much like Nabokov's work. It's a great page turner, to boot."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Doctorow, E. L., Billy Bathgate. 1989. New York, Penguin Plume, 1998.If he had never written any other published novel, I would acclaim this one as Doctorow's masterpiece. By subtle degrees, he brings us to sympathize and understand his young wannabe thug, Billy, who desperately tries to gain the attention and approval of Dutch Schultz, a lethal gangster of the 1930s. We're offered a plateful of deft perceptions, believable character drawings, and detailed descriptions of the times, the places, and the violence of the gang world. Obviously borrowing some characters from real life, Doctorow convinces the reader that whatever happened either really did or could have. His writing is absolutely gemlike in its precision. I found myself postponing the final 20 pages so as not to end the account. Enthralling. Five stars."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Expert storyteller E.L. Doctorow wanted to write a novel about the life of the ruthless and slightly kooky 1930's gangster Dutch Schultz, and he chose to do it in an interesting manner. Rather than doing what most every other author might and delivering a straight re-telling of the events late in Schultz's bloody career, Doctorow used the device of creating a fifteen-year-old narrator, Billy Bathgate, to relate the tale and move it forward. Billy, a smart, tough, but somehow innocent working class kid, walks us through the last year in Schultz's life and tells us about the principal players in the story, Schultz's inner circle of thugs, the rival gangs, the accountant, Bo, who betrayed Schultz when he thought his boss was headed to prison (Schultz beat the tax evasion rap with a gutsy argument that involved protection from self-incrimination) and Billy describes the smoking hot redhead society girl, first the doomed accountant's girlfriend, then Schultz's girlfriend and later Billy's, who gets her rich-girl kicks hanging with mobsters, and who ultimately contributed far more to the gang's downfall than she ever cared to know.Billy leaves behind his none-too-sane mother and impoverished New York roots in a Jewish neighborhood and takes up as Schultz's mascot. He moves along with the gangsters as their expansionist ambitions abrade the more cautious goals of Lucky Luciano (a man so scary to Billy Bathgate that Billy never mentions him by name, even the half-century later in which the memoir of his youth is being told). He is there when Schultz plots to assassinate Thomas Dewey, future front runner in the race for the White House and then a prosecutor taking on the East Coast mob. Billy comes into the picture at the moment Schultz has reached the top of his career, and he rides the decline with him, right to the moment of the crime lord's collapse.Billy was a witness to the \\"hit\\" in a chop house that took out the inner circle of the Schultz gang, and somehow convinces us he sneaked into the hosptial room to listen to the dying Dutchman babble through his hours-long final words, in which the fatally-wounded gangster's stream of consciousness is recorded word for word in a version Billy cautions us differs slightly from the accepted transcript.In the closing chapter of the novel, Billy in his post-Dutch Schultz life, makes the stark transition from mobster's adopted little brother to ordinary teenager. He returns home to his mother, he goes to school, gets a job, eventually enlists in the military when the Second World War erupts. He lives as normal a life as possible. But Billy has a secret not even the piercing stare of Lucky Luciano was able to pry loose from him at his interrogation. Billy, you see, clever beyond words, has made off with the Schultz gang's fortune. He tells no one of this for years, knowing he is watched by the agents of Murder Incorporated. But when the time is right, decades in the future, a whole different age of American culture, when the Depression-era criminals like Dutch Schultz are the stuff of history books, he retrieves his justly-gotten gains and spends the crime lord's loot on a legitimate business enterprise of his own, and becomes a very rich man.Billy Bathgate is a novel that kicks some serious posterior. Doctorow is doubly gifted as a great storyteller and a master writer."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Very entertaining, easy to follow, descriptive and hard to put down. Would like to read more Doctorow. Probably will do just that!!"},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I delved into this book expecting the typical mob story: lots of violence, vendettas and brotherhood. That isn't what it is. Its certainly more of a character study, focusing on Billy and the boss, Dutch Schultz. I was disappointed at first, but next thing I knew I was done with the book and I think I enjoyed it. If it had been longer I think I wouldv'e lost interest though. Good length."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"Doctorow achieves a rare success in combining a rich poetic style with coherent and compelling storytelling in this coming-of-age novel which explores both the romantic mythos and brutal reality of classical American gangsterdom. Many writers have earned their reputation in part through their extravagant and experimental style. Yet, Doctorow climbs a step above these word-sculptors by never allowing his rococo flourishes and tangential tendencies to hinder plot and character development. The result is simply what every reader hopes for, a great story beautifully told.Only a couple of things depreciated this otherwise excellent novel. First, while Doctorow has written some of the best erotic scenes in all of literature, the sex in this book seemed almost too good to be true. I expect that for most fifteen year old boys sex with a gorgeous and experienced older woman would have been much more frightening, awkward, and difficult than it was for Billy. He really turns out to be a Don Juan -- that seems out of character for Billy and detracts from the psychological realism of the story. Also, Dutch Schultz's character seemed under developed considering the importance he plays in both Billy's life and in the overall plot. In spite of the flaws I highly recommend this novel. I give it a solid A."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"I've only read two of Doctorow's books, this one and _The Book of Daniel_, and this novel is about as far from daniel as you can get (though both are excellent). It's an excellent story about a boy coming of age in the 20s and 30s as a sort of member of Dutch Shultz's gang. He learns lifes lessons from these men. Doctorow's prose is lyrical, a sort of irony when you put the beautiful language Doctorow uses with the violence and moral ambiguity of the characters. This is a great culmination of Doctorow's work."},{"Title":"Billy Bathgate","review":"One of the great creative geniuses of our time, Doctorow kept me intrigued right until the very last page.

I'd say buy a used copy of the Harvest HBJ edition instead."},{"Title":"Principles of literary criticism (International library of psychology, philosophy and scientific method)","review":"In the years preceding the publication of Principles of Literary Criticism (1924), I. A. Richards was watching the very foundation of literature change or perhaps unravel right in front of his eyes. Authors such as Alfred North Whitehead, James Joyce, and T. S. Eliot had begun writing texts that represented enormous changes in style, tone, and content. Further, the audiences who were reading these texts were no longer composed of the elite scions of Edwardian society. In increasing numbers, middle class and even (horrors) working class blue collars began to seek the university degree that they felt sure would be a ticket to a more prosperous life. The problem with this growing mass of would-be-intellectuals was that they had to encounter and digest what to them was a bewildering and vastly confusing array of theories of learning that were heavily dependent on the aesthetically oriented Romantic vision of emotion and psychology that contemporary professors of literature insisted must be mastered prior to tackling the admitted complexities of the texts themselves. It was this required assimilation of subjective and pseudo-scientific notions that Richards was determined to overcome and eliminate.Richards also took to task the pedagogy that had been transplanted from Germany that required literature students to master history as a prerequisite to reading texts. According to this model if one wished to study Shylock's motivation for his insistence on his pound of flesh from The Merchant of Venice, one first had to absorb the fullness of Jewish culture and anti-Semitism then prevalent in the Elizabethan age. Once one knew all that, then the play itself became quite secondary if not irrelevant. What Richards sought was a method that would focus solely on the words on the page with considerations of history, morality, psychology, and all other disciplines conveniently ignored. It seemed logical to Richards that a methodology of text over context was the only way to arrive at the \\"true\\" and universally accepted core meaning of a text.Alas, almost from the first day of publication, Principles of Literary Criticism caused a huge backlash from critics who were equally determined not to nudge a host of disciplines to the Dustbins of Unwanted and Unneeded Facts. These critics examined Richards' use of terminology to divide all texts into three overarching categories: good, bad, and defective. A \\"good\\" text clearly presented its thesis. A \\"bad\\" text communicated something but whatever this \\"something\\" was it had no intrinsic value. A \\"defective\\" text also communicated something but this \\"something\\" may (or may not) have had intrinsic value. Richards' critics jumped all over his overly vague use of subjective terminology like \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" or \\"defective\\" in what to them was a pre-ordained failure to achieve objectivity using subjective words. Further muddying the linguistic waters was Richards' unfortunate comment that only those who were of sound mental faculties could develop the requisite critical skills. Still, despite the ongoing brouhaha, Principles of Literary Criticism established the need to pay very close attention to reading skills that we now call \\"close reading.\\" One might argue, then, that the very defects of his theories made it possible for the next generation of theorists to tackle texts in such a way as to sweep aside the outmoded and quaint New Critical methods in favor of a myriad of now accepted means to tear texts apart."},{"Title":"John Donne's Sermons on the Psalms & gospels with a Selection of Prayers and Meditations","review":"John Donne's poetic words pierce the heart and ignite the imagination.

Yes, Missie did party and drink and dine, but only at the beginning of the book, when WWII was still called \\"the Phony War\\". She was a refugee from her country, a princess, who had to leave Lithuania because of Soviet rule. She can't seem to, at first, give up her lavish lifestyle of parties and such, but she never complains when it is time to give up that lifestyle. She and her sister run out of money, have to take care of their family, but they never complain. I would love to see a modern day aristocrat adapt the way Missie does.Also, the parties that Missie attends are hosted or attended by some of the most powerful and influential people during the second world war.Later on though, she is bombed out of house and home... the true reality of living in Germany under the constant destruction, fires, bombing, low flying \\"enemy\\" planes, and never being able to go back to how you once lived shines through. She is not a Nazi, she hates the Reich, and gives a great unbiased account of what it was like to live in Berlin during the war. It is a perspective that you've never heard before.She is friends and co-worker of many of those who attempted to kill Hitler, and supports them. She watches as people she loves and respects are thrown into jail and killed for being associated with those who tried to kill Hitler, and grieves that he wasn't killed.This is a great book. I've read as many books as I can about the holocaust experience from a Jewish perspective, and though Missie doesn't mention the Jews hardly at all (they shielded the Berliners from what was going on in the death camps) this is still a great book for me. The way the Jew were killed is horrid, and this sounds bad, I don't mean it, but WWII was more than that, believe it or not. She tells a different point of view.I've read it about 3 times, I am now on my fourth. It is fascinating to watch as Missie changes from aristocrat to a red cross nurse, trying to survive as best she can.get this book. You won't regret it. It is a true sotry of the death of everyone's lives in Europe because of the war."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Missie Vassiltchikov was an aristocratic Russian who was living in Berlin at the beginning of World War 2. At the time the war started Missie was a habitu&eacute; of the diplomatic party circuit and friends with many of the German aristocrats of her parents class.Missie, through her experiences in exile valued people on their own intrinsic worth and not based on their nationality and she proved to be a good judge of character. Many of her German friends were involved in the 20th July 1944 plot to kill Hitler and finish the war. Missy herself was lucky to escape the death squads that combed Germany afterwards and her diary chronicles the deaths of many of her close friends. It also clearly portrays the horror of living under the allied air raids against civilians, especially in Berlin, in the closing years against WW2 where luck, rather than good judgement, was a more assured method of survival.Missie brings home the fact that \\"total war\\" is a horror for all involved and that there were 'good guys' and 'bad guys' on both sides of the conflict, but in the end it was the ordinary civilians who paid the greatest price for the folly of their leaders. Possibly one of the areas that is an eye opener is the closing days of the war. An area little touched on in movies or documentaries. We get to see some of the human costs of the disgraceful Yalta agreement that the allies signed with Stalin and the starvation and ruin that prevailed in Europe the years after the war. For a civilian insight into the war on the continent this book is first class along with her sister Titania's autobiography."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Missie Vassiltchikov's diary is the outstanding source for anyone who wants to achieve any sort of historical empathy with the German aristocracy during the war years. As a diary rather than a memoir we feel the horror of the bombs, or of the regime, at an extraordinary proximity; as a White Russian and not a German patriot, her criticism takes less for granted and, by witnessing everything on a personal level, the acute sensations of terror and loss are not diluted by blood and guts patriotism. An extraordinary woman in extraordinary times the result is a historical source acknowledged by A. J. P. Taylor to be of first rate importance and a testament to the bravery of the German patriots who tried to carry out the July 1944 coup of incredible dignity and persuasion. Having read these diaries I will never again tolerate being told that the July plotters were nothing but a nasty military junta in embryo. Wonderful stuff."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Princess Marie Vassiltchikov, a member of some minor branch of the Russian nobility who ended up in Lithuania and then in Germany for World War II, can sure tell a story. Her diary is a good page turner. You always know what is going on. You're always want to find out what is going to happen next. I finished this book in a day or two and took it everywhere I went, because I had to find out what happened.She is direct and never gets too intwined in her personal musings (although the curious would want to know more about personal/romantic and other dirt in a private diary).Her story is intensified by the big events she is involved in.She begins with Germany's descent into World War. Then, a number of her associates and probably herself (the editor says she is circumspect about this in her diary lest the diary be found)are involved in the aristocratic attempt to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government in the fall of 1944. Finally, the Princess, as a Russian aristocrat emirge who spent World War II working for Germany, flees first Berlin and then Austria in fear of the advancing Soviet Army.While the princess lives modestly on jobs translating and clipping English periodicals for various German foreign policy enterprises, her world is one of the titled wealthy in Germany and Austria. She's continually mixing it up with the descendants of the Royal Houses of Prussia, Russia, Austria and of Germany principalities like Bavaria and Hanover. Her friends are descendants of Bismark and Metternick. Most of her friends are also princesses, counts, countesses, princes, and even lowly barons.For all the ravages of the War she faces, there is always a great estate or castle to stay in if her home is bombed out. Influential friends are able to send a car to fetch her even when she is stranded in the most remote Alpine villages. There is always a friend in high places to sign a special pass, get her an impossible-to-get ticket, offer her a new job, or pull strings for a transfer out of harm's way once she becomes a nurse. While sometimes there is a shortage of meat, there is always champagne. When there is no oil to heat lamps and cooking burners, there is always enough perfume to use for these purposes. While Germans are starving and millions are being murdered by the Nazis, there are often fine meals on provisions sent from friends in the embassies, from a friend's baronial estate, or from their diplomatic posts in Rumania or Hungary.The marketing of the book attempts to paint Princess Marie Vassiltchikovas a progressive fighter given her association with the Von Stauffenberg attempt to kill Hitler and take over the government. Alas, her aristocratic friends were not against the real setup in Germany. They were attempting to bail out of the war now that Germany was being beaten. They had not opposed Hitler when he outlawed Germany's working class political parties and unions and sent their leaders to concentration camps in the early 1930s. In fact, their party, the German National Party, a party more right wing in social policy than the Nazis, merged with the Nazis in the early 1930s. Most of her mail associates had held important posts in the German government for much of Hitler's regime: ambassadors, provincial governors, police chiefs, staff generals, and other officials. None of them were known for sticking up for human rights, democracy, or workers and farmers.Indeed, what's shocking is the apparent indifference that Princess Marie Vassiltchikov and her pals show to the total suffering that ordinary Germans and Austrians faced, ordinary folk who didnt have castles to repair to when they needed housing, retainers to shoot or harvest food from estates when the food system broke down, who struggled to find bread and milk and never touched champagne. If the Princess and her ilk do face such genuine suffering during these years, what became of German factory workers, small farmers, family shop keepers?This does not mean the good Princess doesn't suffer. At the end she suffers from starvation and its complications. Millions of Germans suffered from stravation and malnutrition at the end of the war because the thoughtlessness of the division of Germany by Stalin and Western imperialism cut across the normal lines of getting food from agricultural areas to non agricultural areas.Between the lines you can read in fears and anxiety that must have continued for the rest of her life, no matter how successful it may have been.Above all, whether you like her or love her or not, the Princess knows how to tell a story you will follow through to the end."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"This book offers an insightful look into life in Berlin during WWII. It also offers a look at a lifestyle which no longer exists in Europe. This is an &quot;insiders&quot; look into life with the Nazis.

This is true for the wealthy as well as the poor, however, the pleasures found differ greatly. This book is not about the poor, and readers with a socialist orientation may find it offensive.Amidst hiding from bombs and fleeing from peril, people celebrated, attended lavish festivities, sought comforts whenever possible. This is about a circle of wealthy and recognized families, European, not just German, from whose midst the would-be assassinator of Hitler sprang. Many of them were hunted by the Nazi regime. This diary of a Russian princess is interesting and spellbinding. It is a very different testimony of a war that left no one untouched."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"\\"The Berlin Diaries\\" by Marie Vassiltchikov is an account of wartime Germany from the vantage point of a young White Russian aristocrat. Although not a native German, Ms. Vassiltchikov and her sister penetrated the upper echelons of German society--the surnames of those who they socialize with read like a \\"Who's Who Among Central Europeon Royalty.\\" Despite their privileged lifestyle, the Vassiltchikov sisters are not insulated from the trappings of the war raging around them: their acquaintances die in battle, they experience rationing, cold offices, nurse duty, and most memorable of all, the punishing bombings of Berlin.If the suspense of who will live and perish around Ms. Vassiltchikov were not enough, many of her coworkers in the Abwehr are secret anti-Nazis and were thus implicated with varying roles in the July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate der Fuehrer with a breifcase bomb. Her writings provide an excellent insider's glimpse of the German Resistance and will force any reader to sympathize with Vassiltchikov; even if they see her as \\"the enemy\\" as a result of her residence in Nazi Germany.The book's readability is a final strength that I will mention. Ms. Vassiltchikov's diary entries are often interrupted by factual passages from the editors, one of which was her brother. These passages explain the course of the war at that particular entry and thus renders the diary easily understandable for those with even a limited knowledge on the Second World War. Even as a frequent reader of World War II, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Berlin Diaries,\\" and so did my co-workers who care little for military history or the time-period. The fact that the book can appeal to such a wide audience is undoubtedly one of its most admirable qualities."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Fascinating. Take two Russian princesses who cannot live in Russia because Stalin would have them bumped off, and who find themselves in Berlin in 1939 and they have to find work to live. Because of their backgrounds they both speak numerous languages and so are offered jobs in the Ministry of Information (Goebbels). All of their contacts are the aristocratic families of Europe and so apart from their shortage of money they can build up a good social life in Berlin. This brings them into contact with many of those who opposed Hitler and takes Missie's Diaries take you through to the tragedy of the Bomb plot when dozens of their friends were executed after show trials.

She finds herself in Berlin at the time the Allied bombing raids are really picking up and describes very well how hard daily life was at a time when whole sections of the city were being pulverised. She also happens to be working for a part of the government alongside some of those who plotted against Hitler and tried to assassinate him in 1944. Her involvement in this is never more than casual and it's a sign of her lack of importance that she is never arrested or interrogated. Unlike most of the people around her she is also able to flee Berlin to stay in various friends' castles and country estates when life in the capital becomes too tough. She also attends many, many parties hosted by diplomats and other members of the gilded set. This is an interesting book, but not rivetting."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"She was young, beautiful, spirited and related to the reigning royal families of Europe, a \`White Russian' princess by birth, Marie Vassiltchikov's first years had been filled with luxurious privilege and those with influence and wealth in pre-revolutionary Russia. Worlds away from wartime Vienna at WW II's end and the sick and hungry hospital nurse who, still classed as a \`White Russian', stumbled through the darkened city to avoid being found by the Russian army.The Berlin Diaries 1940-1945 by Marie Vassiltchikov, an understated, stylishly and brilliantly written mixture of optimism and sorrow, is one woman's personal, candid, and often ironically witty, observations of her day by day life in wartime Germany.In many ways the conflict taking place did not seem to have much of a detrimental effect, at least not on her social life, at the beginning of the war.However this situation did not continue for long and Missie kept her brilliant observers eye open while adjusting to yet another change, not only in her own life style but in the world around her.Many amongst Marie Vassiltchikov's friends, who had had held influential positions within the traditionally aristocratic diplomatic and military world, were involved in anti-Hitler and anti-nazi plots. Although the diary does not disclose how much she knew about them, it does describe in painful detail the terrible chronicle of punishments and acts of vengeance, including against the families and children, that followed when the plots were uncovered.Missie's wartime experiences ended in a battle damaged Vienna, a nurse in a hospital filled with war casualties but insufficient medical supplies and water, and the Berlin Diaries concluding stages provide a brief but moving description of the terrible cost to ordinary civilians, not only of the war itself, but of the starvation and ruin that encircled Europe during the following years.A talented diarist, Marie Vassiltchikov left us with an insider's personal perspective and insights into a period of German history from long ago, one that not only shaped our modern world but whose consequences are still felt today.A remarkable and fascinating read."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"The best and most insightful book I have read about what life must have been like in Berlin during WW II.

It's unusual that my opinion of a book stands in such sharp contrast to the majority.While Missie's story was interesting initially, it soon became a laundry list of where she traveled, who she saw and what she ate. Those things are fine in moderation, but I really wanted to read more of her thoughts and feelings as well as gain a deeper sense of how the war affected her relationships with others. Moreover, it seems obvious that she's having an affair with Adam Trott, one of the main conspirators in the attempt on Hitler's life, yet it's never discussed. I understand that he was married, but it left the reader having to fill in a lot of details, and I found myself wanting a deeper look at their relationship.Finally, I agree with another reviewer who felt that Missie--as a member of a highly privileged class--lacked empathy or even a real understanding of how poorer people were suffering. She seems so oblivious with her champagne, private cars and nice clothes that while I absolutely had sympathy for her, I also thought she came off as a bit of a snob.I gave Berlin Diaries two stars instead of one because there are descriptions of the devastation of Berlin and the bravery of many German people--especially Adam Trott-- that will stick with me forever."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"I read this book for the first time back when it first came out in the U.S. All I can say is that it makes me want to visit the places described and also made me re-interested in history again.

I am now buying a fifth copy. 5 STARS!!!"},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"This is one of the most extrordinary books I've ever read. Missy Vassiltchikov was friends with several of the key conspiritors in the attempt to assasinate Hitler, including Count Graf Van Der Schellenberg and Adam Von Trot zu Holz. It is amazing that given her close relationship with the conspiritors (even after their arrest!) that Missy Vasiltchikov escaped arrest and exectution herself. What's more amazing is that she kept a diary of her relationship with these people and documented her own desire to see Hitler eliminated. She filed these pages with the normal dispatches and documents of her civil service job and amazingly was never discovered.I enjoyed this book as a primary source and for the amazing exposure it provides of the conspiracty to assasinate Hitler. But I also enjoyed the writing--which is quite good--and the details of Missy Vasiltchikov's life, which are quite extrordinary.This book isn't for everyone, but if you're interested in modern German history, or in a story of courage and survival then I recommend it."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"This is the best history book I have ever read.

It could be subtitled, \\"How I ate and partied my way thru WWII\\". Shallow reminiscences of a shallow aristocrat. I've never seen so much name dropping in one place. Only valid historical narrative is in the included editorial comments. The inferrence that the writer was involved in the July 44 plot to kill Hitler is a bunch of bull, she just casually met a few of those involved, having met them at one of her many many eating and partying affairs. Total waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Marie (Missie) Vassiltchikov, a white Russian princess whose family was forced to flee from Lithuania in 1939, found herself stranded in Germany at the beginning of WW II. Her family ties to most of the dwindling royal families of Europe allow her entry into social, government and military circles snd provide the background for her astute observations of human behavior. Her fluency in several languages (including English) served her well, as does an almost compulsive desire to keep a record of the events taking place around her.The reader becomes intimately acquainted with those in her vast circle of friends and acquaintances including aristocrats, European royalty and diplomats,(many of whom were also involved in military and government in numerous European capitals and included descendants of Bismark, the Romanov's, and kings and queens of most of Europe's thrones). The book is filled with interesting character portraits and compelling day-to-day descriptions of life in Germany during this most tragic of times.It is a wry sense of humor that fills quiet moments--though she usually saves her wit for the irony she continually encounters--being able to eat oysters freely when everything else is strictly rationed, or being able to purchase a new hat when all other clothing is scarce and rationed, if available at all. She does not provide answers, only insight.A bi-product of this day to day account is witnessing Missie's growth from a carefree aristocrat to that of a thoughtful young woman, who becomes a nurse. John Kenneth Galbraith said it well, \\"One of the most remarkable documents to come out of the war, and nothing will ever quite match its calm and grace in utterly hideous circumstances.\\"The diaries also offer day-to-day, in-depth insights into the minds and motivations of the July 20th plotters who tried to kill Hitler (many of whom she first learned to know while working in the German Foreign Office-1940-1944).The book is also available on audio and is one of my favorites to listen to. Clear enunciation and the excellent accents by Alexandra Karma (narrator) help the listener follow the many characters and episodes described in the diary. I have listened to this too many times to count. I hope to listen to it many more. In terms of an audio/visual experience is ranks in a three way tie, with two videos (the BBC version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Herman Wouk's The Winds of War and War and Remembrance series) as my all-time favorites.For more information about some of the people and events described in the diaries, her sister Tatiana Metternech's book (Tatiana...) supplies some of the answers. Written thirty years after the fact, it is a very different book from that of the diaries, mainly, I suspect because the two sisters were seldom in the same place at the same time. Also, I suspect, Tatiana, the artist was never the diarist her sister was."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Following the collapse of the Romanov Empire (Russia), the Hapsburg Empire (Austria) and the Hohenzollern Empire (Germany) in the wake of World War I, Europe was overrun by aristocratic refugees. Some of them had family fortunes commensurate with their impressive titles, others did not.One of these impoverished, but well-educated young aristocrats was Princess Marie Vassiltchikov, who was in her early 20s when she and her sister moved to Germany hunting for jobs. Both found employment despite their non-German status, but it was tenuous for young anti-Communist Russians, especially when Stalin agreed to a non-agression pact with Hitler and happily carved up Poland and the Baltic states, including Lithuania in which Marie and her family had taken refuge from the Bolsheviks.Yes, she is aristocratic. Yes, she is beautiful and yes, she is generally broke, cold and hungry. Her looks and her family connections provide a safety net of sorts, and as food supplies shrink Marie's diary begins to resemble an extended food quest, typical of anybody who's hungry. She manages to acquire a modest, but apparently elegant wardrobe and admits to gorging herself at parties when the opportunity arises.Like any beautiful, young woman, she comments on the young men (many of whom are also aristocrats) and how attractive they are (or aren't.) Sometimes her blueblood works for her. Sometimes it works against her. During 1944, for example, the official SS journal (DAS SCHWARZE KORPS/THE BLACK CORPS) rails against \\"blaublutige Schweinehunde and Verrater\\"/ \\"blue-blooded piggish-dogs and traitors\\" who'd conspired to assassinate Hitler. Yet, the leader of the dreaded SS, Heinrich Himmler, continued to revel in his tenuous connection with the royal family of Bavaria, one of whom was his god-father.These were dangerous times for bluebloods like Marie and she survived. Not only that, she left some great descriptions of the inner workings of the Third Reich, the July 20th plot and impact of strategic bombing by the Allies.She doesn't moralize or engage in self pity. She copes, eats when she can, and finds shelter wherever its available. She uses the connections she has and she survives.Her diaries are straightforward accounts of a critical period in world history. She is not a model 21st century progressive, but neither were most of those who conspired to murder Hitler at his East Prussian headquarters in 1944. Some were unregenerate Monarchists and Prussian Junkers intent on regaining lost status and privileges.Her diaries and her situation are difficult for a lot of contemporary American readers to fully understand. A Princess, after all, should be wealthy as well as beautiful. The \\"People's Princess\\" (HRH Diana Spencer)is the archetypical blueblood for most Americans. While Princess Marie had the requisite elegant good looks, she lacked the money and power most of us expect royals to have.We forget, or never realized, that Europe during the 1920s and 1930s included lots of people with very impressive titles, good educations and aristocratic bearing, but little or no money. Being a Princess from an empire which no longer existed might get you invited to parties, especially if you're beautiful, but it didn't pay rent or put schnitzel (even the schnitzel made from dead donkeys) on the table.I liked Marie and her diaries and found a number of interesting insights and facts I didn't know about this period in history. If you keep in mind the totality of circumstances which formed her perceptions, her diaries can provide some interesting and unique insights into this tumultuous period of history.I recommend the diaries and gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"While many readers may become fascinated with the book simply because of the author's pedigree, Vassiltchikov unwittingly opens the door of curiosity. Portraying life in wartime Germany as seemingly footloose and carefree (parties at the Adlon Hotel during bombings, for example; or, to even have parties at all with the desperate situation of many around them) gives an astonishing first-hand account of how the &quot;privileged&quot; class viewed and lived the war. Certainly, this is a very interesting read. Quite fast, as a matter of fact. Moreover, the seeds of the nobility resisting Nazism and attendant ideology come through in the diary, but not completely. Many questions begged to be answered after reading this account. How did the nobility react to the rise of Hitler? Why were they not successful in mounting a successful resistance? What did these people believe, fundamentally? Overall, this is a good book. However, it would be well served, that in attempting to understand this period, to follow-up with equally good treatments of nobility prior to and during World War II. Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"With the events of the past few weeks fresh in our minds and the American military mobilizing as we speak, I wish more people would read this book. Although the book does deal with some larger themes, the most poignant part for me was the description of day to day life in a world at war. It's too easy to romanticize the hunger, struggle and fear from a distance. We need records such as these so that we don't forget about the indignity and squalor that war rains down on humanity."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"This is an astonishingly honest and unique book, a diary by a White Russian aristocrat who spent the war years in Berlin and recorded her doings, in English, nearly every day of the war.It is an inside look at European royalty and the growing aristocratic resistance to Hitler which culminated in the July 20 plot, or Valkyrie.You come to know and love Missie, her family, and the brave and courageous resisters who plotted Hitler's demise and an early end to the war. If successful, millions of lives would have been saved. Unfortunately, the plot failed and Hitler reveled in the nearly seven thousand plotters and their family who were summarily executed in the aftermath.A remarkable book and a must-read for any WWII buff."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"A crisp and bright narrative about what WWII was like from the perspective of a young Russian lady living in Berlin.

This is a very personal yet not private story."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"Berlin Diaries, Marie Vassiltchikov; Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. (1985; 1987)A brilliant & dangerous book, as it is written & to have been written, during World War II by a non-German alien - of all things, a Russian - & in of all places, Berlin. I was thrilled to read it. I must read it again.In 2007, David Patrick Columbia, editor of New York Social Diary, wrote an account of her life (with great, good heart), which reminded me of the pleasure derived from Marie's phenomenal account of her family's vagabond & precarious existence as refugees from the Russian Revolution of 1917, and her wartime experiences.The story of a driven & doomed member of the July 20, 1944 conspiracy to kill Hitler, Adam von Trott zu Solz, is particularly compelling; as is also her account of the tragic, senseless bombing of the Vienna Opera House in the last weeks of the war.Marie's brother Georgie was one whose post-war perseverance led to the publication of Diaries, & the reminder of his existence came to pass with the news that Sunny von Bulow had passed away.George Vassilchikov had been Sunny's first choice of a man to wed. But unfortunately, she ended up with both a first failed marriage to someone else; & then, with a second husband, Claus von Bulow - an infamous union which resulted in notorious sorrow & tragedy.That this book has received rave reviews from so many fellow correspondents reaffirms my faith in the discrimination of those who have been fortunate enough to have heard about and then read the Diaries."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"(4.5 stars)This book is quite unlike the typical WWII-era memoir which most folks are used to. The most obvious difference is that Missie is an exiled Russian princess, and not some ordinary citizen or refugee in Germany and Austria. She also wrote her diaries in English instead of in German or Russian, so she's really not a full part of the society she's living in. In spite of the differing perspective, the story is very riveting and well-told. Gaps in the narrative are filled in by editorial comments by Missie's brother George, letters she wrote and sent during the missing periods, and reminiscences from Missie, friends, and relatives years later. For someone who isn't well-versed in WWII history, the editorial comments will be very helpful, such as details of the infamous massacre at Katyn, or more information about some battle or event that's only alluded to.Though she is immune to the suffering and deprivations of the ordinary people around her in the beginning, by 1943 Missie and her circle of friends and relatives start to feel the heat. The Allied bombings raids on Berlin didn't make a distinction between commoners and nobility, and food and fuel shortages affected everyone. Because of her association with a few people involved in the July 20, 1944 plot to kill Hitler, Missie eventually has to get out of Berlin, eventually making her way into Vienna, where she works as a nurse for most of the duration of the war. Deprivations and bombing raids continue in Vienna, though, and as the war nears its final days, she once again is faced with the necessity of escaping to a safer locale. Not only is it imperative that she get out of the way of the fighting, but she also doesn't want to be discovered by the Red Army, as she is a White Russian.While it's always difficult to make value judgments on someone's journal, since we can't put ourselves in that person's footsteps, and because this person probably never dreamt it would be published, I did get the sense that a few other reviewers did, that there's a seeming indifference to the fate of the ordinary people around her. While Europe is going up in flames, Missie, her friends, and her family are still going to parties, hob-nobbing with royalty and nobility, driving around in cars, drinking champagne, using perfume, having strings pulled for them so they can have nice jobs, saving ridiculous luxury items, and staying in castles and manors. Even when the war finally catches up to even the nobility, she still has all of these powerful connections who can get her exit passes, travel permits, castles and estates to escape to, jobs to be accepted at, and cars and trains to flee in.Ordinary Europeans often had to escape on foot and drag their necessary possessions in carts, were left homeless, couldn't turn their noses up at horse meat if that were their only food available, didn't have powerful connections to save them from harm and grant them safe passage through dangerous territory, and cared more about escaping with their lives, the clothes on their backs, and a few needed items, instead of rejoicing that some Count friend of theirs managed to save something stupid like fur coats and artwork in his automobile. And while the selling point of the book is that Missie was intimately involved in the July 20 plot, I didn't see more than superficial circumstantial evidence for that. She was friends with some of the plotters and tried to get some of them out of jail, but other than that, there isn't any compelling proof that she knew way more than she was telling. That isn't even the main focus of the book. And since there are so many people moving in Missie's circle, it's sometimes hard to remember who's who.Overall, though, it is a very interesting book for anyone who's interested in a different perspective of WWII, or who's interested in the White Russian experience abroad. Obviously it's not Missie's fault that she was born into nobility and could have all of these wartime luxuries and safety nets that ordinary people could only dream of."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"The first thing which told me that this would be a very different story was the background of the author. After all there weren't many White Russian Princesses who were working in the German Foreign Service in the turbulent years of the second world war. It must have indeed been very trying times for the author and her family when the Germans were still allied to the Russians, and the constant threat of being deported loomed over their heads. Marie Wassilitchikow's diary is written with clarity and feeling. Some points, I feel however were not properly reflected on. On the subject of Subhas Chandra Bose, the introductory lines say that Hitler completely thwarted the aims of Bose. That is by far a very simplified comment. It is true that Hitler did make Bose's life very difficult. But Hitler could never thwart the aims of a freedom fighter of Bose's stature. The explaination to that lies in subcontinental Asian politics and not in Europe. And lastly the Indian Legion did accomplish many things, but mostly in Asia, fighting to free their homeland, in Europe also a few units did take part in the Normandy Campaign. So again, to completely write off the Indian Legion is too vague a comment. Apart from this the diary was brilliant and told with great insight, it showed the growing stress of the writer as the war went on. Many of those she knew became casualties of the war. Among them her close friends like Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, who was at the time of his death in January 1944 the leading nightfighter ace of Germany. Many others perished as Marie tried to make sense of what was happening in those trying times. All in all, a captivating story told with great poignancy."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"I was not sure exactly whatI would be reading in this book. A close friend gave it to me.

Among interesting details you can find that oysters were not on ration cards. This by itself speaks volumes..... If I chime in is to say that as the son of French folks that got bombed during the war, Miss Vassiltchikov allowed me to get a new perspective to all those tales of woe that I grew up with. If non German folks suffered a lot, it was no picnic for the Germans either, and perhaps a lot of them did not really measure what was really happening to the world as they knew it. This book has a very curious effect: on one hand one blames further the German elite that failed to stop Hitler; on the other hand one does wonder up to what point this elite was in large part a victim too. For better or for worse history belongs to the death camp victims as well as to the airhead elite of Germany. The reason one needs to read this book."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"The author of these diaries was 23 when the war began in 1939, and canot be blamed for the rise of Nazism. She knew many German aristocrats, including ones who suffered the extreme penalty for opposing Hitler. I found fascinating the account of how life went on in aristocratic circles in Germany while bombs dropped and Hitler ran his terroristic regime. This is another view entirely from Victor Klemperer's monumental volumes entitled I Will Bear Witness, which I read with sheerest fascination on June 11, 1999, and April 7, 2000, since Missy, the author, almost seemed to bear a charmed life. But like Klemperer's diary, time seemed to move so slow as one reads, knowing that not till May 8, 1945 would the ordeal end--and not even then because life in Germany postwar was no bed of roses for some time. If one considers the author as the young woman she was, not one in a position to answer for the rise of Hitler or to impede his ruinous course, the diary is a moving tribute to the human spirit."},{"Title":"Berlin Diaries, 19401945","review":"This is an excellent memoir based upon the diaries kept by Marie 'Missie' Vassiltchikov, a White Russian aristrocrat who resided in Germany and Austria under the Third Reich.I particularly enjoy reading about daily life under Hitler from a woman's point of view.

It was my first exposure to narrative poetry and it has been my favorite book since then. When I read twenty years later that it was also the favorite book of John F. Kennedy it reassured me that he would avoid war at all costs. It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark. He is able to impart the real devastation of war on the lives of those affected by it. I would reccommend it to anyone who loves poetry and history. It is a truly American story of a war that should never have been fought."},{"Title":"John Brown's Body (International Collectors Library)","review":"I ordered the book with ISBN 0822205947 thinking I was ordering the epic poem by Stephen Benet.

It was by far my worst experience as a student - the material was far too abstract for that period of my development, and completely without any reference to my life. The entire time we spent on this was torture.Even today when I hear the name Stephen Vincent Benet I cringe in horror - some sort of literary post traumatic stress syndrome. I surely hope that high school teachers are not still inflicting this on their students.Perhaps it is a great work of literature - but it should NOT be required reading for high school sophomores!!! There is nothing in it that such a student can relate to."},{"Title":"In On It","review":"This play calls for 2 male actors and a bare-bones yet ingeniously designed spectacle.I am buying this script because I just finished seeing \\"In On It\\" written by playwright Daniel MacIvor. He also served as director in this particular production. It was extended for an additional 2 weeks due to popularity and word of mouth.I completely agree with the first reviewer in every respect. \\"In On It\\" is everything a play should be and gives new playwrights an example of what excellent playwriting is all about. It's tightly written, builds upon itself, lends itself to being creatively staged, and gives a great body of depth and richness for actors to work with.I could see this play being read for enjoyment (although this play especially, as all plays, is best seen in production); or for classes in acting, playwriting, directing...pretty much all fields in theatre and performance art.Beautifully conceptualized. If you have to choose just one play do script analysis or to teach students - choose this book.\\"In On It\\" is an excellent buy and should be in your personal library."},{"Title":"In On It","review":"I have not physically read this title, but saw a performance of the play recently and it is a wonderful piece of theatre.

What was daily life really like before even these artifacts were tools? Perhaps something else did survive . . . In &quot;The Walking People&quot;, Paula Underwood presents stories of real events lived by real people from the oral tradition of her people. Not a collection of mythological tales, they cover a span of history, geographical locations and events that is intellectuallly staggering and nearly impossible to put down. These are the stories of the Oneida people &quot;from the beginning&quot; which trace their intentional wanderings over three continents including how they crossed what is probably the Bering Strait, explore the events and decisions that made them who they are, and record some of their tantalizing encounters with other people. These are also teaching stories and can be understood on many levels intellectually and emotionally, individually and collectively. They can be seen as a straighforward historical account; an absolute literary delight; the unfolding of a people's culture and society; a presentation of the development of individuality (ego); a process of learning how to learn; an anthropological exlposion of possibilities; the evolution of scientific experimentation and evaluation; a description of ordinary living in various times; stories of individual lives and commitments - and so much more. I have read &quot;The Walking People&quot; cover to cover at least a dozen times, each immersion bringing fresh and expanding comprehension. The language used and the physical presentation on the page combine to make reading this book a nearly &quot;auditory&quot; experience. It invites the reader to walk with these people through time, participating in their experiences, sharing the tears of their misjudgments, the joy in their masterful accomplishments, and the relief that the laughter at their predicaments brings. It is a most extraordinary glimpse into the perceptions and thinking of real people in ancient and historical times. It is very difficult to describe the deep psychological effect of perceiving the actual voices and syntax of people who lived thousands and thousands of years ago - suddenly, &quot;history&quot; becomes an intimate, personal reality. Almost understated in terms of today's world of extremism, rampant emotionalism and dramatic egotistical conflicts, these stories carry a haunting impact quietly hidden in the simple, direct telling that spares nothing. I have no doubt that these stories have been kept accurately for millenia. This is the first presentation I have found that is a sharing of one Native American people's heritage; it has been my experience that such depth has either been lost altogether or is usually carefully preserved as part of the private, heartfelt identity of the Original People of America. Paula Underwood's generous recounting of the Oneida oral tradition is a stunning and manumental achievement in language and scope of material, a very special and unique gift to whoever cares to explore its pages. &quot;The Walking People&quot; blows the western world's catalog of knowledge to the winds, tatters our self-imposed limits regarding what is possible and how the possible may be accomplished, and rebuilds hope in a positive way - provided we can perceive the possibilities contained inthis true epic saga. It is a sharing of the soul for the soul, touching the essence of us all."},{"Title":"The Walking People: A Native American Oral History","review":"This is a great story, compellingly told with simplicity and beauty. It also happens to be the best single book I've ever read on &quot;organizational learning.&quot;The &quot;Walking People&quot; left central Asia and walked across an ocean, over to another ocean and back to the great lakes. On their way, they had to learn to deal with an ever changing circumstance, both physical and social. In order to survive, they learned how to learn as a people more and more effectively.This story deals with issues such as the balance between diversity and unity, how to honor individual styles of learning and use these to help the community, ageism, sexism, racism, cooperation and competition, the balance of long term goals and short term necessities, planning and improvisation, war and peace.Are you beginning to get the picture?

I read several pages each night. It is a big book, over 800 pages, written like a poem, and almost impossibly precious. The wisdom between its covers is astounding. For what this book teaches is something we, at this time in history, desperately need to know: how to start anew after devastation. How to be a whole people after we've been reduced to fragments.

Easy, interesting read!"},{"Title":"A daughter of the snows,","review":"I love pretty much any story about the frozen north-west and this was no different. Some descriptions and feats may be a little overdone, but it was very interesting, and for the most part, realistic. Written in true London style, it fits the territory's view of good heart and good blood succeeding through hardships. I was slightly disappointed that it ended so abruptly, but on further thought decided it fits the book and characters. And this way, I get to create my own ending! If you like stories of the lawless north, you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"A daughter of the snows,","review":"Jack London achieved great fame with his adventure tales of the Klondike Gold Rush, most notably the extremely popular novels The Call of the Wild and White Fang. His very first novel, however, has since faded into obscurity. A Daughter of the Snows, originally published in 1902, tells the story of Frona Welse, a white woman born in the Yukon Territory, who, after being educated in the United States and Europe, returns to the mining town of Dawson to reunite with her father. London deserves to be commended for creating the character of Frona, a strong-willed, intelligent, and independent heroine that was years ahead of her time. Nevertheless, he may have overdone it, as Frona comes across as a bit of an unrealistic superwoman. Not only is she stunningly beautiful, she also excels at everything she attempts, whether mushing a team of dogs across the frozen tundra, acting the part of Nora in Ibsen's Ghosts, or, when the occasion arises, even practicing law.A Daughter of the Snows is not a typical Jack London adventure story. It's more a comedy of manners, like a Jane Austen novel set in the frozen North. Shortly after her arrival in Dawson, Frona attracts two opposing suitors, and the predictable plot revolves around which man shall win her hand. The setting within the Yukon is almost irrelevant. Most of the narrative takes place in the parlors and saloons of Dawson, though some wilderness adventure does occur in the last several chapters. When Frona and friends are not reciting poetry to one another or agonizing over whether or not it is proper to associate with a dance hall girl, they are busily engaged in dialogues in which London showcases his peculiar preoccupation with race. In the opening sentence of chapter eight, Frona asks, \\"And why should I not be proud of my race?\\" Thus begins a series of conversations about how the Anglo-Saxon is destined to conquer the world. Words like \\"race\\", \\"breed\\", and \\"blood\\" are tossed about so casually between Frona and her peers, at times their evening salons sound like the committee meetings of a eugenics society.London's writing is a bit clumsy throughout. There is often a general lack of clarity in simple matters like who's speaking to whom in a conversation, or how people and things are arranged in a given space. It's as if London had a vivid picture of the scene in his imagination, but was unable to adequately translate that scene to the reader. The book is also unnecessarily lengthy. Several of the thirty chapters are merely conversational digressions that do nothing to move the plot forward and could easily have been eliminated. At times it feels the book was padded simply because London was being paid by the word.Enthusiastic fans of London's writing will find some entertainment value here. It's interesting to see the nascent seeds from which sprang such an illustrious career. Many of the themes and plot devices introduced in this book would be developed by London more thoroughly and successfully in later, better works. For the casual reader of London, however, there's nothing here that hasn't been covered to far better effect in the short stories found in outstanding collections like The Son of the Wolf, The God of His Fathers, Children of the Frost, The Faith of Men, or Lost Face. In fact, of all the works from London's Klondike period, A Daughter of the Snows is the least worthy of reading. It's not a bad novel for a beginner, certainly not a horrible failure, but with an author as prolific as London, who wrote masterpieces like The Call of the Wild, The Iron Heel, or Martin Eden, why waste your time reading one of his inferior works?"},{"Title":"A daughter of the snows,","review":"Long time since I have read Jack London. This was not a repeat for me, I never knew this work one existed until I saw it on the Kindle menu. I was expecting an exciting story that London is famous for, and I was disappointed. It's a good story, but not among his best in my opinion. A wealthy girl from a strong background takes on the harsh Klondike. I confess I skipped through much of it."},{"Title":"My Name is Not Gussie","review":"A beautiful book to be handed down to future generations.

The story telling voice is so personal, turning the last page of the book is truly like saying goodbye to a friend...my only complaint, if I might be a &quot;kvetch&quot; like Tante Feindele in the story, is that it left me wanting more, hundreds of pages worth! As it stands, it is a perfect picture book for older children, with an especially attractive layout: each double-page spread offering on one side a two-column anecdote and on the other a brightly-colored, detailed watercolor.

Less successful are works such as &quot;Hymn,&quot; and &quot;Antiphon.&quot; Written during the poet's years at San Quentin, they derive, it appears, from too much Swinburne consumed too quickly and digested too little. Still, there is no such thing as TRULY bad Wantling, and those interested in what was happening at the fringes of what was left of the Beats around 1970 could certainly do worse than search out this book.--Kevin Jones"},{"Title":"On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life","review":"It's on my kindle waiting to be read.

If you have brought up to believe in creation as truth, this is a short-sighted insult to your religious beliefs. For the evolutionists who hold Darwin in high regard, this is a great read, confirming what you already have been lead to believe to be true. Take a step back and pay attention to what Darwin says near the end that he even questions his own conclusions based on actual science, not conjecture. The actual book content is very good for the time in which it was written and what it portrays as his opinions based on his very limited science.

His style of writing is somewhat informal, biological jargon aside, which translates nicely in the audio version. I normally listened to it on the tram, when walking or cycling, so, all in all, an easy, enjoyable read. Naturally, I did not pick up everything when just listening to it at these times (people elbowing you, seeing a cute dog, losing balance on bike etc. all result in momentary distraction and subsequently missing a few lines). However, I was considering buying the written text as well to follow it with when I have the time to study it properly. Maybe that's something to consider?

We've all heard of his famous journey on the H.M.S. Beagle to the Galapagos Islands on which he studied numerous species of plant and animal life. We all know that his observations there lead him to the deduction of evolution. However, how many of us have actually read his original work? Due to an illness, Darwin published On the Origin of Species before he believed it was finished. However, he had spent the better part of 20 years gathering and organizing his information. At the time, evolution was a radical idea, as many scientists believed that species were independently created and incapable of change. In the interest of brevity, Darwin summarized his findings and filed them neatly into titled sections within chapters of specific observations. There observations led him to conclude that present day plants and animals were not stagnant representations of their ancestors, but rather products of a process called natural selection.A famous poster in many grade school science classrooms depicts a series of sketches of an ape slowly standing upright until it finally resembles a present day human. If you recall this Darwinian concept that humans evolved from a single common ancestor, it may surprise you to learn that Darwin believed that some domesticated plants and animals have multiple species as ancestors. He observed that the countless variations among domestic species, such as dogs, were far too vast to be caused by the evolution of a single shared ancestor. By selectively breeding plants and animals, humans are practicing a sort of unnatural selection. Darwin tested this hypothesis of artificial modification as a means to evolution by observing the breeding of two different types of carrier pigeons. This man-made alteration created a fertile hybrid bird. However, Darwin's bird's fertility suggested to him that his idea of multiple origins was correct as the new bird could now produce similar offspring. This way of creating new species is more common in domesticated species rather than wild species as wild species are less likely to breed across specie boundaries. Furthermore, fertile hybrids face much difficulty in reproducing healthy offspring. In order to create more of their new distinct species, the rare fertile ones would need to breed with other hybrids, likely their siblings, which could cause biological detriments. Darwin noted that this theory was only applicable for the offspring of two similar species, such as two types of birds, as there had been no case in which a fertile offspring was produced by two immensely distinct species.Gradual changes also occur in wild plants and animals. In what would become his legacy, Darwin looked at the evolution of undomesticated plants and animals while in the Galapagos. According to Darwin's famous theory of natural selection, only the finest individuals of a given species survive. To demonstrate this, he observed that plants and animals with different features live in different elements. Individuals with well-suited traits are more likely to survive. These individuals were therefore more likely to breed and pass on their traits. Offspring with these beneficial traits continued to pass the traits on. Today, we refer to this idea as \\"survival of the fittest.\\" Additionally, many animals adapt to climate over time. For domestic animals, it may be caused by multiple bloodlines from wild ancient animals that were fit for different climates. For wild animals, the transition from a parent species artic climate to a present day tropical one most likely took many generations of evolution to complete.Constant adaptation as a progression to biological development was not a commonly held idea amongst Darwin's peers. While they had correctly identified that animals in certain areas, such as near the shoreline, had different features than their counter-parts that lived in different conditions, they failed to recognize adaptation because the believed that animals were static representations of their ancestors. Darwin, however, was skeptical of this idea and decided to put it to the test. From the same observations, Darwin performed some of the aforementioned experiments. In a logical deduction, Darwin concluded that it was only over the course of time that these individuals living in a specific environment adapted to the conditions and began to change form.Darwin compared his theory of evolution to the geological processes that have shaped our planet since the dawn of time. No one can see these small changes happening just as one can see the erosion a small stream causes. Only over many years does a small stream carve out a grand canyon. This is how the evolution of species works. Small modifications accumulate until new species are formed. This concept allowed Darwin to explain phenomenon such as the flightless bird. Over many generations, the ostrich began to rely on its powerful legs for protection so much so that it no longer needed to use its wings as an escape mechanism. Today, after many generations of disuse, the ostrich's wings are essentially useless.Overall, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species is a groundbreaking and brilliant book, especially if you take into account the fact that it was first published over 150 years ago. It's well organized and full of evidence from which Darwin's conclusion seems logical. The research in this On the Origin of Species caused the plant and animal development paradigm to shift. In addition, Darwin's work set a foundation on which many present day evolutionary scientists' work is based. If you are looking for a fascinating account of the observations that lead to Charles Darwin's conclusion of evolution, it would be wise to read Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species.Works CitedDarwin, Charles.

What also struck me was that (unlike the IDiots), Darwin was very humble about the limits of his knowledge of the subject about which he probably knew more than anyone else alive at the time. I found myself skipping over the rather tedious lists of supporting detailed evidence he presents for his ideas and instead read the chapter summaries in detail. His arguments anticipate and clearly refute every one of the arguments put forward by the Creationists at the time. It is disheartening that these same tired, defeated arguments (irreducible complexity, failure to grasp the implications of deep time, failure to grasp fundamental statistical concepts, etc) are still being pushed today by religious fanatics of all stripes in their irrational attempts to subvert the teaching of biological science and substitute religious dogma for it. If religious dogma is allowed to substitute itself for science courses at the high school level, we will find ourselves back in the dark ages, with totally unaccountable \\"god ordained\\" leaders chosen for their ability to regurgitate dogma while completely unable to grasp the complexities which absolutely must be dealt with if our technological civilization is to continue to function."},{"Title":"On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life","review":"Great to hear the other opinion, and it IS opinion.

I gave it 5 stars because it is a book that cannot be left unread if you ever wish to argue for or against evolution, or just follow these debates. I read it at the rate of about five pages an hour and wrote copious notes. After reading this book, I came to the conclusion that Darwin's theory was almost certainly incorrect. Don't get me wrong, I believe life evolves, I just have a hard time believing it happens the way Darwin proposes. After reading this book, I read The Decent of Man. This really shook my belief in Darwinism. I recommend that these two books to everyone who calls themselves informed, just wants to be informed about this subject. Also, I recommend they read them in the order they were written. Origin of Species was written almost a decade before Decent of Man.

It is insightful, loaded with an overwhelming amount of empirical observation, and astute interpretation of those data. Darwin crafted a well thought out theory. His book sold out on the first day in 1859, and it has been in print pretty much ever since. His theory has been under attack from the non-science community and under intense scrutiny by the scientific community for the past 150 years. The result is that the theory is more complete and robust than ever.If you really want to know what's up with Darwin and his theory, read his book. Amazon and Kindle have made it available for free.

I began to search for other editions of \\"Origins\\" to see if they included the diagram. And that search found not only that most versions did contain the diagram, but that the full text of this work ran to over 550 pages - twice as many as are included in this version.I should also have known better than to have procured a free version.

But, how many people have actually read it? If you haven't yet, it is well-worth reading.Darwin spent over 20 years researching his ideas, preparing his arguments, and writing this book. He did a great job! \\"On the Origin\\" is surprisingly easy to understand. Just look at the beginning. Instead of trying to leap directly into his basic idea and premise, Darwin chooses to gradually lead the reader up to the basic idea of evolution by first point out how humans have caused evolution to occur in our domesticated animals (something very easy for all humans to see even in the 1850s). Darwin then goes on to point out some of the evidence that he and others had seen at that time that indicated that evolution had occurred.

At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again.The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski"},{"Title":"On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life","review":"Variations exist within populations that compete for scarce resources needed for survival, and many of these variations not only affect the ability of the individual to compete, but also can be passed onto children. Those variations better suited for competition will be passed on at a higher rate than those that are less suited for competition due to higher rates of survival. In this way, nature itself non-randomly selects those variations most fit, thus diversifying populations, creating branches in the Tree of Life.While this book is 150 years out of date, and the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection has been significantly modified since its publication (especially since the discovery of DNA and the mechanisms present in both heredity and mutation), the main principles of Darwin's argument, stated in the above paragraph, remain the core of evolutionary science. This is an important work in the history of science, one that everyone should read for historical literacy. If, however, one is seeking to learn the modern evidence for evolution, collected both through laboratory testing and through field observations, then Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne, or The Greatest Show On Earth by Richard Dawkins would be better choices. Indeed, while the hierarchy of shared characteristics amongst animals, and the hierarchy of interspecies variations interpreted in light of the aforementioned hierarchy of shared characteristics itself constitutes great evidence for common descent, and Darwin's argument for natural selection as the mechanism by which diversity within the animal kingdom has increased remains extremely convincing and effective, it is best to familiarize one's self with all of the modern data, and all of the independently arrived at trees of life from non-overlapping fields of study that are all *gasp* identical."},{"Title":"On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life","review":"If you have never read this book, you really should sit down and take the time to do do.

If you have not than you have no basis to refute it, and can make only the most idiotic of arguments. After all, just about everyone alive now who HAS read it, has read Genisis too.

But how many of us have actually read it? I've read a lot of other books on evolution, and amongst them, I would recommend \\"Why evolution is true\\". But I had never actually read the book that brought it all about. Then there it was, available on Kindle, for free. What did I have to lose?Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I was thinking--this guy lived so long ago. Would I be able to follow his now-dated English? Not being a biologist, I thought that this book would certainly be over my head. But to my surprise, it was not. It's quite readable, by me and just about any common Joe or Mary.This is no small feat. Consider that at the time, most people believed in special creation--that every species had been specially created by a supreme being to fill a specific niche. Looking around at how well creatures fit their niches, this seemed so obvious. Of course, we now know that there are no permanent \\"special niches\\". The geologic record testifies to tremendous changes in the earth's climate, from times when there was almost no oxygen in the earth's atmosphere, to ice ages that covered almost the entire surface of the earth, to mass extinctions due to giant meteor strikes or super-volcanoes. Evolutionary life has been \\"set back\\", so to speak, many many times, and it is only because life is able to evolve through natural selection that new organisms evolve from their ancestors to fill ever-changing niches.Darwin wrote in a clear and simple style--and as one who tries to keep abreast of scientific literature, I can say with a certainty that this is a rarity. Yes, YOU can understand this book, and I have learned a lot about clear writing from it. Darwin kept it simple. As should we all!Darwin was also an honest writer. With his vast knowledge of both human and plant anatomy, he realized and acknowledged the gaps in his theory, and did not shy away from them. Most have been since resolved due to a more extensive fossil record, the development of the science of genetics, advances in geology (including continental drift and more extensive understanding of the earth's geological history) and advanced dating techniques. Consider that without the evidence that all of these scientific advances has revealed, Darwin was able to piece together an explanation of how the different species came to be--an explanation now well-supported by these various disciplines. His ideas quickly took hold, spreading throughout the world in less than 150 years, and revolutionized the way we look at ourselves and our world. I am hard-pressed to think of a single idea that has spread so fast in the course of human history, and with such explanatory force.No, it's not a Tom Clancy thriller.

I trumped the whole girls-and-horses trend that began with \\"National Velvet\\" and ended with \\"My Little Pony\\". I even made a point of avoiding anything horse/wolf/dolphin related for years and years to come. Now I'm in my late 20s and I figure that if I can't put the past behind me and start reading some horsey books then I'm not worth my librarian credentials. I had first heard of \\"Magnus and the Fire\\" when a children's literature listserv to which I belong (Child_Lit in case you're interested) started singing the praises of this book. I was familiar with author Jennifer Armstrong already. She penned the extraordinary non-fiction retelling of Shackleton's ill-fated voyage in, \\"Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World\\". With a keen eye for a good story lurking in history's facts, I found her switch to picture books interesting. This isn't her first, of course, but it's probably the best. Considering the fates of those work horses utilized by fire departments until 1900, she gives us a touching story of one horse who had a hard time letting go of his job.At the Broadway Firehouse in Hope Springs, three big gray horses were needed whenever a fire broke out. Strapped to the heavy steam pumper when the fire bell would clang, Magnus, Billy, and Sparks knew how to pull the equipment to the source of any and all fires. All that changes the day the firehouse buys itself a newfangled motorized fire engine. Suddenly the horses are put out to pasture behind the firehouse. This is all well and good, but they have a hard time hearing the fire bell and not attending to the fire themselves. Magnus becomes so disturbed at being left behind that he constantly leaps over the fence, sometimes busting through it when the firemen try to pen him in. This seems like a huge nuisance until the day the new fire engine breaks down and Magnus is needed to pull it to the flames. After that, it becomes clear that while Magnus was necessary one last time, he isn't any longer. He's taken to the country to live with the old Captain and his grandkids and the only bell he hears is the dinner bell. \\"And pretty soon Magnus learned that the sound of the bell meant one last hug from all the kids before they ran inside, where the fire in the stove was nice and warm\\".Much of what determines how good a picture book is comes in what an author and an illustrator DON'T do. For example, Armstrong knows that her story stands strong on its own two legs. She doesn't need to add fantastical (some might say sickly) elements like Magnus and the other horses talking amongst themselves or with the firemen. Similarly, artist Owen Smith gives us beautiful and realistic paintings for each scene. And there isn't a moment in this book of a child trapped in a firey building only to be saved by a heroic horse. Armstrong isn't going for the easy emotions or the cheap sentiments. \\"Magnus and the Fire\\" is a class act through and through. It is not, I should point out, based on an actual story. The author includes A Note to the Reader at the back of the book explaining the history of the firehorse, saying that no particular animal was the basis for Magnus himself.The illustrations by Owen Smith take this already well-written story and elevate it to a kind of picture book classic status. Though the bookflap says that he is most influenced by muralist Diego Rivera, the figures in this book look to me more like modified Thomas Hart Bentons to me. The book's endpapers show sepia-toned images of Magnus from the story. 1930s picture books, for lack of money, used similar colors and the choice to make the endpapers look this way is nothing short of inspired. As for the paintings, they fairly swell with color. The only one I objected to was the last image of Magnus. As he stands majestically under an autumn tree, Smith has painted an oddly unconvincing child reminiscent of those 1960s big-eyed children on velvet. It is the sole flaw in an otherwise enticing title. For the kid obsessed with firemen (a common obsession) this is a go-to book.The book is rather similar to those other tales in which someone is replaced by a technological advance. \\"John Henry\\" comes to mind, though the ending of \\"Magnus and the Fire\\" is a lot happier than John's, I should think. For one thing, I half-expected Magnus to fall over dead after pulling the heavy engine at the end. He doesn't (he wouldn't anyway) and the ending is a satisfactory one. I hesitate to use the words, \\"future classic\\" when referring to children's books, but \\"Magnus and the Fire\\" deserves it. A beautiful book that will be much loved by anyone you give it to."},{"Title":"Magnus at the Fire","review":"This book made my four year old son very sad.

There are no pictures of the various trees used, but he gives a good description about how and where to get good stick material.The latter book is more complete, however, listing sources for suppliers. The former does have an appendix of tips, a chapter on judging, and directions for assembling a ring-horn cane (Horn Disc Sticks). In all other respects, I'd say The Craft of Stickmaking is equal to the latter in information, interest, and comprehension, just not as many color pictures, although there are enough black &amp; white pix to illustrate to my satisfaction."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"I had a very hard time plowing through this book. Tried to read through it 2-3 times, and found it difficult. I don't have a background in philosophy, but I do have two doctorate degrees, and this book gave me a headache. There are too many long lists of titles that mean nothing to me, as well as too many diversions to explain the life and thought of all the men and women Emerson met in a lifetime. I felt that the author could have pared down the information a bit more. There were clearly some details that diverted like the fact that Waldo's brother got paid for writing another student's essays and then the students got together to see if it was a good deal or not. What does this tell us about Waldo? I enjoyed learning about Emerson's life but felt like it required more effort than it should have."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"When I first read Nature, I was impressed and inspired, but overwhelmed. Just as when I read Walden, I viewed the author as this paragon of human genius who thought on a plane much higher and nobler than myself. Through Richardson's excellent prose, uncanny insights, and dear familiarity with his subject, I find a human being, flawed as much as I am, who has innate genius but is influenced by his times, the broil of philosophical and scientific thought surrounding him, and his own driving desire to know truth. I found a kindred spirit (though Emerson himself detested the phrase!). He has inspired me to go on to read Goethe and de Stael and all the other great thinkers of the early to mid-nineteenth century. I only wish I could have had a conversation with him! He is truly a unique and gifted individual, and I am glad to know him and consider him a friend."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Robust account of one of the seminal figures of early America, one attempting the creation of an indigenous culture cast in a more universal mode than that of the provincial Christianity of his roots. The courage to give up his secure life as a minister for the uncertainties of exploration and creative renewal marks Emerson's trail through a pioneer's psychological American wilderntess, to touch on and integrate everything from the post-Kantians, to the Buddhists/Hindus to the Persians and Sufis. That Emerson evolved into a near firebrand abolitionist is an aspect of his life unsufficiently told, and this part of his later career runs clear in this book. All in all, a first rate pioneer story of another kind."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"This is the only biography of Emerson that truly matters. Richardson locks in on the essentials - the development of a seeking mind is search of the ground of being and the nature of reality. Emerson is our Founding Thinker and to do him justice, a biographer has to grapple with the how and why a mind grows, changes, struggles and reaches new heights. Even if you haven't read much Emerson, this biography sheds light on what Emerson meant when he said, \\"Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.\\""},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"If you have a desire to know one of the greatest inspirations in American history.. Richardson's biography on Emerson will bring you as close to the real man as any historical perspective can! Richardson's research and flowing phrase truly do justice to one of the most engaging writers, lecturers in U.S. history. The biographer not only highlights Emerson's work--he puts it into detailed context: through Emerson's thoughts and through the societal and political currents that were shaping the United States, at that time. Robert Richardson has carefully preserved an american icon: both the myth and the man that was Ralph Waldo Emerson."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Richardson does something that is very rare in the world of biography. . . he makes Emerson come alive.

And in this case, I'm almost as impressed with the biographer as the man he reports. This book has 100 chapters, each one as full of outstanding ideas as some entire books I've read. I owe many wonderful evenings and mornings to Richardson who has given me the keenest insights into my favorite teacher and author. Richardson so accurately portrays Emerson's journey of a self-realized soul marching in his conviction of the final authority of the individual Self, that at times I felt I was making the same journey myself. In so many moments, something swelled within me while reading this book, and I thought perhaps even such a one as myself might grasp these elevated concepts Richardson so lucidly explains. Emerson himself said, \\"only that book is good which puts the reader in a working mood.\\" While reading this book I have felt encouraged in my quest to do the work of unfolding my own nature with reverential awe--as Emerson admonishes us--by keeping a journal and studying to unify myself with the eternity at the core of my being.Richardson not only studied Emerson to write this book, he studied the books that Emerson studied, thereby showing Emerson's method, intellectual origins, and native genius that courageously broke with contemporary traditions to create a cohesive world-view so inspirational to many.Emerson, more than any other author I have read, believed in the grandeur of the soul--not just his own--but in each of us. He wrote in his journal, \\"When I look at the rainbow I find myself the center of its arch. But so are you; and so is the man who sees it a mile from both of us. So also the globe is round, and every man therefore stands on the top. King George, and the chimney sweep no less.\\"If you are looking for a book to not only stretch your limits of understanding but help you realize the helping hand at the end of your own arm, enlighten yourself by studying Emerson with Richardson. You might also consider spending the extra few dollars and get the hardback . It'll last a lot longer under the wear you'll give it referring to it again and again."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"I must confess that I don't understand the reader review below who found this biography of Emerson to be a difficult read. Although not quite a page-turner, I managed to read this in very little time at all. I must also confess that I do find Emerson himself incredibly difficult to read. But what I find to be the case in Emerson himself, I did not find to be true in Richardson's biography. While I find that Emerson constructed one stunning sentence and aphorism after another, I generally find his essays to be slow going. Nonetheless, while I am not his biggest fan, he is unquestionably one of the four or five greatest figures in American intellectual history, and Richardson's biography does him great justice.The great merit of this biography is that at the end of it, you feel that you have gained considerable insight both into Emerson and New England intellectual life in the 19th century. I was especially intrigued with Richardson detailing of Emerson's reading. Emerson was, without any question, a great reader. Great readers rarely read books from cover to cover. Samuel Johnson, who was himself one of the most accomplished readers in the history of civilization, once said that we have more of a need to reread than to read. But he also once quipped, &quot;What, you read books all the way to the end?&quot; Emerson did not read books all the way to the end. But like Johnson and other great readers, he had a genius for picking out the most important points. What Boswell wrote of Johnson is true also of Emerson: &quot;He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end.&quot;One comes away from the book also enormously impressed with Emerson's character. He seems by any standard to have been a remarkably good human being. He was both a man of high principle, and a man of powerful attachments to other human beings. I found the accounting of his various friendships, many to equally famous individuals, to be of the utmost interest. Also, he seems to have met virtually every important thinker and writer in the English-speaking world, from Coleridge to Carlyle to Melville.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a deeper knowledge of Emerson's life and work. By any standard, Emerson is one of the giants in American life. His influence on American thought is incalculable. Consider: not only was he the major influence on such American literary figures the magnitude of Thoreau and Whitman; he was a profound influence on artists such as Thomas Cole, Moran, and Bierstadt. America's deep-rooted environmentalism is steeped in Emersonian Transcendentalism. John Muir was a devoted reader of Emerson. One could make a case for Emerson having had perhaps more influence in the shaping of American thought than any other individual. This biography is an outstanding introduction to that person."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"A remarkable biography of an enduring genius in American history.'Emerson: The Mind on Fire', is a reading experience that was at once moving, educationally rewarding and, above all, inspiring. The book is a well- crafted, well- researched analysis of 'the' American philosopher of the 19th century. After completing the work, I felt as though I knew the great man intimately, and found myself feeling sad that he wasn't in the phone book or had an email address to invite him and his family over for dinner. As Thoreau once wrote, &quot;Surely joy is the condition of life.&quot; And this is most certainly the leading emotion that I felt while reading this book. And as Emerson wrote: &quot;The purpose of life is individual cultivation, self expression, and fulfillment.&quot; At the risk of sounding too praiseworthy, Richardson's commendable biography has given me the opportunity to experience all three of the above. Since a freshman in highschool, my predelication to Transcedentalism has moved in and out of my life like a warm breeze. This particular work has re-lit this old philosophical spark,causing the winds to rise again, so to speak, creating a kind of intellectual excitment. I have read hundreds of biographies on many great individuals, but this one ranks as one of the best. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Once I started reading this book I could not stop for very long. It was so good I did not want it to end. This book traces Emerson's intellectual and spiritual path in such great detail that it enables the reader to further investigate Emerson's sources if he or she so chooses. The biographical information was quite complete as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Emerson or Transcendentalism. I noticed that Richardson has also written a biography of Thoreau and I will likely read it. This book represents a very high degree of scholarship and a great effort on the part of the author. I also greatly appreciated the photos of Emerson and the people close to him.Personally, I would have liked to have seen a few more photos of his second wife and his children. I would have also liked to have learned how his wife managed after Emerson died and perhaps some information regarding his descendants. However, these are my own personal preferences and are in no way meant to diminish the excellence of this book.The material is well structured into about 100 brief chapters which I thought made the reading easy. I never felt bogged down due to the length of the book. This is not a short book.I really came away from the book with a sense of the man and an appreciation of the events and societal pressures of his time. After reading this book I think anyone familiar with Emerson's writings would feel like sitting down with the man to have a discussion to clear up a point or two."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"This is clearly a superb piece of scholarship, which I very much enjoyed. One caveat: if, like me, you do not have an extensive background in philosophy, there is much you will not understand. The author frequently uses phrases like neo-platonism without explanation. In addition, much of Emerson's thought revolves around some quite challenging philosophical points, and the author does not attempt to explain them for an amateur. I can't say this is a criticism, because it is probably impossible to write an intellectual biography and explain basic philosophicial concepts at the same time. And, despite this, I feel at the end that I have a good understanding of Emerson. Non-philosophically trained readers, however, should be warned that many discussions will simply fly over their heads, as they did mine."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Mr. Richardson's 'Thoreau A Life of the Mind' was not only the best biography I've read on Thoreau, but one of the most exhilerating and enlightening reading experiences of my life. So I decided to read his 'Emerson The Mind on Fire.' And it was every bit as intimate and intelligent.There are times you feel that you're intruding upon Waldo and Henry on one of their walks. It was an endless stroll of two intellectuals and humanists on the path of being very human. Each of the one hundred chapters (both books) are kept short, which helps move the reader from topic to topic without ever feeling put upon (too much detail can drag what is otherwise very interesting.) Though, for me personally, I would love to savor every moment these two great men shared. I don't think I could ever get bored.Emerson has many close friends with whom one gets to know intimately. His personal address book was a whose whose of literary and intellectual greats.The relationship between Emerson and his second wife, Lidian, is of great interest. She was also intellectual and as much a partner in life as she was a wife. Her presence is everywhere in Emerson's life.Emerson's essays are pure poetry. And the behind the scene snippets into how they became a part of his legacy was both insightful and relevant to the day to day interactions and causes he committed himself. His transformation from the unremarkable child into the neverending 'student' of self-education and commitment to social conscience throughout his entire adult life is one to be admired.Mr. Richardson is one of the best biographers of nineteenth century literaries. He is truly one with his topic."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Robert Richardson's biography of Emerson is superb. Though, as Richardson reminds us, Emerson did not like superlative language when precise and adequate language would do, it is the case that at times the superlative, the precise and the adequate converge (as, in fact, they often did in Emerson's writings). Richardson's biography is indeed superb in its unfolding of Emerson's life -- the loves, the friendships, the losses, the intellectual and spiritual hunger, the religious quest, the writers in America, in Europe, in Persia and elsewhere to whom Emerson owed and acknowledged debts, the grasping at and for a world, the determination of a single, brilliant human being to find his way and to see his life, and all individual lives, as imbued with the divine and thus worth living.The book is also superbly written. Each short chapter offers enough substantive insight to urge the reader into the next. It is a long book, but not long-winded. Richardson provides the reader with some morsel of insight in a few pages of narrative, and then offers a rest to digest what has been said. His placement of quotations from Emerson's journals, essays and other works is brilliant, offering the reader a useful sketch of Emerson's metaphysics and ethics. In my own case, this has allowed time to reach for other literature more fully descriptive of the events or scenes offered in a particular chapter, or to reread chunks of Emerson's writings while moving through the biography. The book is a useful tool not merely for a study of Emerson's life but for a study of Transcendentalism and of the interplay of ideas across the Atlantic that shaped American thought in so many ways. One sees more clearly where and how such writers as Nietzsche and Thoreau obtained the seeds of their own truths from Emerson's works and thoughts.Richardson has set the standard for the writing of future biographies. Again, simply superb."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"In the past, my experience in reading Emerson has been similar to reading the Tao Te Ching; interesting, non-mainstream in its point of view, puzzling to understand what exactly it means. So I would pick up the Tao and read it at different times of the day and different frames of mind, hoping that it would resonate with me, but it never did. Maybe it was the cultural difference, or the language, or not being able to easily identify with Lao Tzu. Such had been my experience with Emerson. I wanted to understand him better because what little I did understand made me want to learn more, but I just couldn't get there.This biographer, Richardson, really did his homework and any who want to understand Emerson better should appreciate this work. Emerson kept exhaustive journals and collections of his thoughts for many years. He read widely and deeply, kept detailed notes, and thoroughly indexed the notes. What perfect material to access for writing a biography! Apparently Richardson went back and studied much of the source material that Emerson references in his journals and brings into this biography an understanding of who Emerson was reading and what it meant to Emerson, so we receive the pleasure of following along on a journey in the development of a powerful mind. Then Richardson is able to write about this development so that it is easily readable to us moderns. It's quite a remarkable achievement.\\"Mind on Fire\\" shows me that Richardson is certain that studying Emerson and his message is worthwhile. So much consideration has gone into this biography that when I laid it down after almost non-stop reading for several days over the holidays, I felt like I really understood Emerson for the first time, and now have much better insight. I plan to let this book simmer in my mind a few more months, then pick it up and read it again.If Richardson could also write something as lucid and detailed to help me understand the Tao Te Ching, I wouldn't have 10,000 questions about the 10,000 things. ;-)"},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Most biography is history, and Emerson: The Mind on Firs is no exception. The reader learns more about a segment of mid-eighteenth century New England society and the people around Emerson than about Emerson. Margaret Fuller, Aunt Mary, even Henry Therou are as much a part of this book as Emerson.Enjoy, too, the lists of books mentioned, and the notable people he met. Ideas and issues of the day come into view as a natural process in reading about these lives. I learned more about transcendentalism and understood it better from this book than I did from a college course devoted to the subject. I also saw the civil war from a different perspective--if you can believe that from the masses of print on the subject.The book seems to move in small, slow steps -- 100 short chapters might explain that -- and may be a good book for the nightstand for a tranquil moment of thoughtful repose before sleep."},{"Title":"Emerson: The Mind on Fire","review":"Robert D. Richardson, Jr. writes so masterfully that the great RWE seems to show up in your livingroom and tell you about his life, his times and what mattered to him most. The book also reveals that Emerson was an abolitionist and valued, sought out, and was influenced by female intellectuals of his time. As Emerson is my favorite American, I found this book nothing less than thrilling. I was sorry to see it end. It's a great work and even in these busy times, worth a second reading"},{"Title":"People of the Dawn: Volume 2 in the Holme Trilogy","review":"This work is the second volume in the Holme Trilogy. This is an interesting &amp; unique body of work, because the hero in this Viking saga isn't the traditional warrior - his slave is. Holme has freed himself &amp; his family from the homestead that kept them as slaves all their lives. Venturing to a fictionalized trade city, based on the actual town of Birka, Holme ends up becoming a master smith &amp; a man well-respected (by some) &amp; feared (by all). Holme is not satisfied with just his family being free, but goes on to fight for all thralls to become freemen. Another theme in the trilogy that gains more importance in this book, is the spread of Christianity into the heathen land where most people worship barbaric &amp; crude wooden gods. As Holme gets used to being around people, his intelligence &amp; philosophy become sharper, &amp; as in the last novel, there's virtually no dialogue and the book will slip from a modern-day narrator to Holme or other character's own stream-of-consciousness narrating the tale.

Better Read Than Dead is the 2nd book featuring Abby Cooper, a gifted intuitive in Michigan, and her friends and loved ones. Where the 1st book really introduces Abby and her friends to us, this book pulls out the stops and lets us see the world of the paranormal. There is a favor a friend calls in to read fortunes with Tarot cards at a Greek wedding reception that lands Abby in some hot water indeed. The plot is believable as she deals with the unsavory consequences of having read a hit man's cards at the reception. This brings her to the attention of a Greek gangster, who wants Abby to advise him about his 'business' and subsequent heirs.Having lived in Detroit and suburbs of Detroit, I can remember Greektown and working at RenCen. Ms. Laurie is hitting her stride, very comfortable in Abby's skin and effortlessly gets us involved in her life and friendships of Dutch, her hunky FBI boyfriend, and their friend Milo, a great cop, her sister Cat, her handy man Dave, and her sweet pooch, Eggy.This book gives insight to the world of the psychic and their responsibility of their readings - what if someone not skilled read fortunes and completely misinterprets what is before her like Cat did? or visions were read another way than intended? It is a great responsibility that professional psychics face, and Abby is a great example of that - dealing with her Crew - her guides etc who help her from the Other Side.Ms. Laurie is a delightful writer and gifted psychic herself, causing this reader to see her website and get a reading - she was excellent and a super person. Highly recommend you try too. If you are a fan of Abby Cooper's, you are interested in the paranormal. Follow your guides and read Abby's adventures and see how special this series and their writer truly is."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Yes, I'm very grumpy today.

This is a very well written book. I love the fact that we are immersed in Abby's world as we follow her to work and home, get involved in her sister troubles, as well as worries about her house.Abby always explains who she is and how life as a Psychic works, or not, depending upon just how much information she gets and if she understands what's being said to her.The story has several twists and turns and I always find myself worrying about her life as well as the lives of the people who surround her.I don't want to write about the plot or lay out a list of what happens because that's why you read the book. I do recommend this if you love mystery, intrigue, witty dialogue, great writing and most importantly, good fun.I see a great writing career for Victoria Laurie and I hope to see a long run for Abby Cooper. It won't take long for her to join the ranks of \\"Stephanie Plum,\\" or \\"Kay Scarpetta\\".I would buy or borrow this book today as it's a great read if you're interested in detective stories, the Pyschic world, great characters, and an author who takes you places you've never been.

As soon as someone tells Abby not to do something, she goes out and does it just to spite them, even if it means putting herself in danger. At 30 something, I would think she'd be a little more grown up. Also, Cat is just plain annoying.I'm sorry.

It is such a fun experience, especially for us weirdos who can relate to the descriptions of funny feelings of intuition and little voices. Abby's character is charming, wonderfully real and grounded for being a little weird. My absolute favorite part of this book is Abby's perfectionistic sister's attempt at a Tarot party. I \\"knew\\" where that one was going. Thanks again Victoria and please keep up the good work!!!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Love, love, love this series, wit, charm, humor, suspense, mystery, what more could you ask for. I recommend you read them in order. Victoria Laurie brings a fresh new plot to the mystery world and for me she can't write fast enough.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"I read this book because I liked the first one enough to want to know more. Abby is an intriguing character and her being a psychic gives the whole mystery novel thing a good twist but this book was just kind of boring.I was hoping for Abby to become more dimensional in this book. For Laurie to explore the character, but Abby didn't grow at all in this book and for a 30 something year old she seemed immature. The story line was also kind of passe, the first book was all about Abby and Dutch ( a detective she fell for) and their tango into love but at the beginning of this book you learn that Dutch is going to be MIA for most of the book and even when he is present all you want to do is hit him. And then two story lines are weaved together (not too convincingly) for a predictable but way too contrived ending. And Abby seems to have varying levels of psychic abilities throughout the book. I get that sometimes a psychic is on and sometimes they aren't but the differences in her abilities seemed a bit too extreme for that excuse.However, I do still like the idea of the character and I can see potential in the writer. The skills need to be honed and the style needs to be a bit cleaner but in the future I might give one of her stories a read again.I would pass on this book... Give the third one a try maybe, I've heard that Abby starts to round out at some point."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"This one is just as good as her first, Abby Cooper, Psychic Eye. It's fun and serious and managed to keep me from putting it down until I finished. Abby Cooper is about as real as any character gets (except for the psychic part, don't we all wish we were?). Victoria Laurie created a character that you can't help but love. I will be reading her 3rd and I hope she continues to write.Also, as I wrote in my review of Abby Cooper, Psychic Eye, if you love the Stephanie Plum series, you should seriously consider this one. I can't put either down once I start. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Better Read Than Dead by Victoria Laurie is amazing psychic mystery ride. This book has rape, The Mob, The FBI, Kidnapping and amazing chase. I bought her next book this weekend and can't wait to find out what the next adventure will be....They just get better and better!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Love these pyschic eye mysteries! They are a little different than the 'run of the mill' junk out there now. Abby is funny, sweet, but fiesty too. She's no super-hero, but she can still solve a mystery. I love that she plays detective while still doing her normal life stuff, going out with boyfriends, talking to her sister, getting chased around the house by a ghost! Good reading!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"I truly enjoyed this installment of the \\"Abby Cooper Psychic Eye\\" series. Victoria Laurie is a very entertaining writer, and I love her sense of humor. Abby is just as loveable and confused in this book as she was in book one, but there is much more action and intrigue in this plot. Abby unwittingly gets mixed up with the mob, puts her love life in danger, and puts her loved ones in danger. It's action from start to finish and it's a super-fast read that I thoroughly enjoyed. So why only 4 stars? I like to leave room for improvement within a series!I read the criticisms that Abby's character is too romantically immature for a 30-something. What? Do you know many single 30-somethings? I know plenty who are immature! I interpret this to be a consequence of Abby's psychic gift; she is quite comfortable and even content giving readings to her clients, but she is unsure of herself in normal relationships. I don't think she is immature, just naive. After all - if you could \\"read\\" other people, wouldn't you be just a little skittish? :)"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"I am going to make this short and sweet. I loved this book! I could not put it down and absolutely had to finish it this morning before work. Read it!!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"A murder/rape suspect is on the loose and Abby does everything she can to help find the man. Once again, she teams with the Royal Oak Police Dept., although Milo is her main contact since Dutch has joined the FBI. This book has dual storylines - one focuses on Abby/Milo as they search for a rape suspect and the other storyline focuses on Abby and her connection to the mob. After she helps her friend Kendal read tarot cards at a wedding reception, Abby finds herself right in the hands of a mob hitman. The suspense in this book was actually quite good and I wondered how each of the two cases would be resolved. I found the writing style and characters very believable and fun and, all of the characters from the first book remain in this one. The part I didn't like was how strained Abby's relationship with Dutch was/became through the course of the book. Their relationship has a lot of angst and I didn't particularly like that - Dutch and Abby belong happily together! A really great book in a series that is fast becoming a fave of mine."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"This is the 3rd story (the second one was a novella inDrop-Dead Blonde) in the Psychic Eye series from author and professional psychic Victoria Laurie. I enjoyed the first two, and the next two are in my TBR pile.Abby Cooper is a professional psychic. She's looking forward to reuniting with her FBI boyfriend Dutch on Halloween after a two-month absence, but her friend and colleague Kendal asks her for a favor: he's contracted to read tarot cards for a wedding party and he needs another psychic to help out. She'd like to refuse, but she owes him big.After a quick tutorial in tarot-card-reading (not Abby's specialty), she's doing fine, until she realizes that a) the man whose fortune she's reading is a hit man and b) the family of the happy couple is The Family--the mob. She feigns illness and she and Kendal leave, but the mob boss has heard of her accuracy, and insists on consulting with her.Meanwhile, Dutch's ex-partner in the police force asks for Abby's help with a serial rapist.Abby refuses the first and accedes to the second, but true to form, the mob boss won't let her refuse--she faces increasingly severe threats to her business, her dog, her home, and her life.And on top of everything, her sister decides to visit, and her reunion dinner with Dutch turns into a threesome--with his attractive, female partner who makes no secret of the fact that she'll try to get Dutch into bed when they leave--immediately--on their next undercover assignment. Dutch, being male, is oblivious.Abby being a psychic is a great door-opener, but it doesn't make the series. The wonderful writing does that. There isn't one mis-step in this book. Abby's gifts help her out, but only so far. She still has to use logic to interpret the psychic clues she gets, and she's not infallible. She sticks to her principles, but not to the point of being TSTL. She's hurt and angry with Dutch, but not to the point of overreacting. All the characters behave exactly as you'd expect them to in real life, and there are quite a few characters, all of them with distinct personalities, so that's quite a feat.The mystery is intelligent as well, though the adventure plot, with Abby trying to stay one step ahead of the mob, overshadows it. There are several plot threads woven through the story, and none of them is given less than its due.Being a romance reader, I have to mention how much I appreciate Dutch's character. He's worthy of Abby's affections, but he's also very human, very real. He screws up, gets defensive, doesn't know how he screwed up, figures it out, apologizes, grovels a little, etc. So much nicer than those too good to be true pretty boys. That said, though, the romantic interest thread of the plot is only a small portion.Abby's relationship with her \\"perfect\\" sister is another example. Even in the smallish portion of the plot allotted to it, their relationship is clearly drawn, and Abby in particular ends up coming away with a better understanding of her sister and herself.And to top it off, all the threads end up intertwining somewhere along the path--and not in an awkward, coincidental way.I truly enjoyed this book, and I'm planning on digging those next two out of my TBR pile soon."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"I needed to read this book out of the series Unfortunately the library did not have a copy. I received this so fast, I didn't have time to finish the book I picked out to read while I was waiting.Book was just as good as the other books in the series"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"This book was fabulous. I love the main character and all that she goes through. I think Ms. Laurie's books are fun and very entertaining. The mystery keeps you guessing until the end. Another great novel in the Psychic Eye Mysteries."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"It started out so simply. Detroit psychic Abby Cooper was just going to help out her friend, Kendal by reading some Tarot cards at a wedding. (What kind of nut has Tarot Card readings at their wedding). That should have been her first clue that things weren't going to go well.Her second clue was while doing a reading, she realizes that the man, wearing a mask, (As are all the guests) sitting in front of her is a hit man who's killed a lot of people.Leaving the wedding in a hurry, Abby isn't too pleased when she realizes that she had just been doing psychic readings at a mob wedding.She's even less pleased the next day when the mob boss, Andros, father of the bride, has her hauled to his house. It seems he has a little problem with having paid for two Tarot card readers at his little girl's wedding, only to have them run out at the beginning. He'd like his money back and he'd like her to do a little job for him, find his wife, who disappeared over twenty years ago and hasn't been seen since.Abby has enough on her plate, as she's helping the police find a masked man who has been attacking women and killed his last victim, so she turns down the job, although she does write a huge check to cover their leaving.The mob isn't that easy to put off and Abby finds herself not only trying to outrun the mob but convince the police that they've arrested the wrong man and worrying about her boyfriend, \\"Dutch\\" who is on his first assignment as an FBI agent with his superior, a gorgeous woman who seems to want more than a partner relationship with him.Highlights:Although I don't believe in psychics, the character of Abby Cooper is very believable.I love that fact that she has several different storylines going on at one time. A lot of characters and a lot of things happening which really get you into the story.Dutch - the almost perfect boyfriend.Kendal - who finds his boyfriend in bed with another man when they get home from the wedding and running off to think things over, taking the mob bosses money with him, leaving Abby holding the bag.Lowlights:Minor one. Why if Milo (Dutch's former partner on the police force), asks her to help find the killer and listens to her clues, suddenly acts as if he doesn't believe in her psychic ability when she says he's arrested the wrong person.This also goes to Dutch who had seen Abby doing incredible things in the previous stories, suddenly act as if he didn't really believe she had any abilities at all.Great heroine, and a very enjoyable series."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Abby is at it again. This time as she repays a debt, she gets sucked into the unsavory dealings of the mob. She again handles herself well, staying true to herself, and makes sure the bad guy gets it in the end. The romance with Dutch still leaves a bit to be desired, however, I think that will be corrected in the next installment. I eagerly await the release of her next book in December and will definately tell all my friends about her. If you haven't read Victoria Laurie yet, you're missing out!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"This one may even be better than the 1st in the series!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than the first in the series. Abby was toned down and not nearly as unlikeable.If the author stays on this course with the character and the series, then I think she has a winner."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Abby Cooper is a psychic intuitive. Her friend Kendal gets her to help him read Tarot cards at a wedding reception. This isn't her forte, but she owes Kendal. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for them to realize they're doing some readings for very shady characters. They leave immediately.If only that were the end of it. A Mob boss hears about it and wants her to help him with some business. She tries to say no, but he doesn't take no for an answer. Before long, Abby finds herself deep in trouble.At the same time, her FBI boyfriend Dutch is off on a special assignment with a beautiful new partner. And Dutch's old partner Milo has Abby helping him find a masked man who is attacking and raping women.Abby tries everything to stay out of trouble and get her life back, but she almost loses her life along with everything else. Can she survive and get free from the Mob?I am not a believer in psychics, but I really enjoy this series. Abby is a fun and likable character. Dutch and Milo as well as Abby's friends and family really enhance the story. I like the way the author has made Abby so that she doesn't always understand the messages she gets. This lets her bumble her way through life which can get her into trouble without her always knowing. I do like the way she works with the police, but they are still quite skeptical.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"This is a really good new series.

Thanks for sharing intimate parts of yourself through Abby which we can tell you've done, she is just too genuine and real to be anything but. I highly recommend her books for anyone who wants a good mystery and a book you simply can't put down."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"What a fun series! While I have no psychic abilities, it's not hard to see a great future for Abby Cooper! After reading Psychic Eye, I looked forward to the release of Better Read Than Dead, and was not disappointed.When Abby's friend Kendal asks for a favor, her intuition was buzzing in her head, warning her away. But, since Abby owed Kendal a favor, she ignored her guides and ended up reading Tarot cards at a mob wedding. YIKE! The mob don \\"contacted\\" Abby seeking her services, very persuasively, and Abby found herself complying, afraid for the safety of herself and her family. I love Abby's sister Cat. Though Abby does not take advantage, Cat is wealthy. She has \\"everything\\", yet is a teeny bit jealous over Abby's psychic gift, trying her hand and failing at Tarot card reading.The book moves smoothly, with many interesting examples of Abby's ability guiding her along. For example, the picture in her mind of a mailman represented the post office, which she realized too late. Also, I love her inboard lie detector - how handy would that be! My kids would sure be in trouble if I had that ability!I don't see much of a future between Abby and Dutch. I suppose since he's a cop he is skeptical. But he's such a jerk about it! And blindsiding her with meeting \\"Joe\\", his partner who turns out to be a woman. Sheesh! Well, I guess it keeps me rooting for Abby. I mean if his character was sugary, we'd be bored.I look forward to the next book coming in December!"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Read the first Abby book and REALLY liked it...This one is even better.

Of course we all read some that are difficult to get through and are unworthy of our time. But we have also read some that we can't put down; a one day read. This book is all that and more. I was hooked on Victoria Laurie with her first book and anxiously awaited this one. Her stories just keep getting better and December can't come quick enough; when the third installation of the Abby Cooper series comes out. Definitely pick up this book and enjoy the ride. Better yet get the first book and extend the trip.

She and her friend skip out of the wedding reception after that - but word of Abby's psychic abilities reach the mob boss who hosted the reception, and Abby simply can't say no - well, she does, but it doesn't matter. This, obviously, places her in a very delicate position. While Abby tries to help the police with a current case, she also is working out a way to not work for the mob, without letting either the police or the mob know of her involvement with the other. Another great story with a (for me) realistic point of view from a practicing psychic. December 2005 will herald the next in the series, A VISION OF MURDER."},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Though he won the lottery and retired from the Royal Oak, Michigan police department, Milo Johnson works part-time helping the understaffed police with solving crimes.

Meanwhile her main squeeze Dutch Rivers is an FBI agent in training is embarrassed that his Abby is a psychic. All three of Abby's situations come together in one final reading that could leave her joining her crew on the other side.This reviewer foresees a long run for ABIGAIL COPPER, PSYCHIC EYE as her second tale BETTER READ THAN DEAD is a fabulous paranormal detective thriller with Abby yanked by both sides of the law as well as her disillusionment with Dutch. Abby keeps the plot focused whether she is jealous or fighting with Dutch, talking with the crew, helping Milo solve the case, or accepting an offer she can't refuse. Victoria Laurie provides a lighthearted entertaining psychic amateur sleuth novel that will entertain the clairvoyant cozy crowd.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Better Read Than Dead (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 2)","review":"Others have given the plot of this book in their reviews, and done it very well, so I'll stick to giving my opinion of the book. Abby does a favor for a friend and ends up trapped by a Mafia boss who pulls no punches in getting Abby to work for him. I found this book to be slightly darker than the first, because the Mob boss is one REALLY bad dude. All the characters that I love are here, starting with Abby herself. Ms. Laurie makes her such a real person, and such a likable one, that I wish I could meet her and her troop of friends. (Especially Eggy!) This is a great murder mystery and had plenty of psychic insight for those of us who love that sort of thing. I loved this book and have read it twice so far. Like revisiting old friends.

Amateur sleuth, Abby Cooper, a psychic with powerful insights that earns the trust of her clients and the police, also comes across as a vulnerable and sensitive individual. In fact, she seems so real you might want to be friends with her.It is fast paced with lots of sleuthing action and enough baddies to make Abby sweat it out with them. Psychic readings by Abby gives the book the added chill, suspense and nail biting sessions that urges you to read on and on. Tend to agree with some reviewers who mentioned that Dutch, her boyfriend, is not the right fit for her. Initially led to believe that something might be brewing in the relationship towards the end but with a clever twist of the plot, Abby & Dutch are.....fill in the blanks.

When I sit down to read the book it is like sitting down to coffee with a friend I haven't spoken to in a long time. The story unfolds at a superlative pace. I certainly didn't want to put the book down.I loved visiting with Abby's handyman Dave and her dog Eggy - I can't say the same of her boyfriend Dutch. I'm surprised that Abby would be with someone simply did not believe that psychics exist. I don't believe for a moment that he treats her as well as she deserves!

It takes one of her clients to suggest this solution.The whole mafia harassment story arc was annoying rather than entertaining.Abby's reaction to Dutch's boss Joe was way too over the top.

Better Read Than Dead is the 2nd book about Abby Cooper. Abby is a gifted psychic who lives in Michigan. In this second book we learn more about Abby's friends and relatives and we also learn more about Abby's psychic gift and how she handles her abilities. A friend of Abby asks her as a favor to read the Tarot cards at a Greek wedding reception, and it is this favor that causes Abby a great deal of trouble.

The story of Delmore Schwartz has been told well by biographer James Atlas, but this literary treatment has the drama and humor of a Shakespearean history. Here, as elsewhere, Bellow mixes gangster antics with philosophy, with scenes that make one cry with laughter. There is the gorgeous Mercedes pummeled by the baseball bat swinging, maddened Chicago punk. There is the weirder than ever meeting held in a wash room behind the swinging doors of a toilet booth. There are, as ever, the demanding, beautiful women, but here there is Humboldt, the manic genius who gossips about T. S. Eliot, and dies one day while taking his garbage out of a flea-bag hotel. Bellow plays himself as Charlie Citrine, the guilt-ridden former friend of Humboldt/Schwartz, who agonizes over his own success and his brilliant friend's failure. New York intellectuals in the American laugh machine, Tolstoy in Disneyland: it's Bellow's subject. How does the serious man make a life in America?"},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is one of the three bests books I've ever read. Better than anything I've ever read, this captures the tension between ideas, action, and human relationships. Bellow's prose is packed and his characters here are unforgettable."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Saul Bellow's style of fictional writing, with its philosophical digressions and intellectual heft, owes alot to the fictional writing of the poet/short story writer Delmore Schwartz. And this roman a clef is a touching ode to Schwartz, presenting the reader with a sad and poignant portrait of the poet as he was descending into alcoholism and madness. If you have an interest in Schwartz and/or the relationship that Bellow and Schwartz had, then the novel is a must-read.Much of the philosophizing in the book concerns the difficulty of achieving success as a \\"serious\\" artist in an American culture that only values art as another commodity. And the book shows how that kind of culture can break an artist like Von Humboldt Fleisher (the character based upon Schwartz). Although it's true that the American culture that Bellow depicts in this novel is from the mid-twentieth century, the issues explored here are just as relevant today."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"this book is captivating only if you have loads of patience to go through all the intellectual material loaded in it by the author. it is not the kind which can be whole heartedly endorsed to everyone. the plot is about Charles Citrine a famous author- now in decline- and his poet-friend Von Humboldt and their internal struggles. like everyone else, Citrine too faces all the common problems of life. these are all encompassing interms of physical (hairloss), material (eluding success, lawsuits and money), emotional (ex-wife, gold- digging girlfriend, ambiguous friends), and intellectual (philistinism, deciline in arts, Humboldt's failure etc). but the most important quest for him is to define consciousness. he is forever struggling with this enigma. he is in search of an answer for the following mysteries of nature. what is this consciousness, is there a spirit and a soul, what do they mean, is there a higher form of consciousness like the spirit, does this consciousness remain after death and if so what are its consequences and so on. he is scared of a conscious entity after death but again if there is none, he argues the futility of a single life. these enquiries of his range from topics like meta-physics to mysticism and spiritualism. though Bellow may not have actually attempted to deal with this subject, it forms the most interesting part of the book. the rest is in the higher realms of intellectualism which one may neither follow nor comprehend. but one is helped in tiding over these parts by Bellow's typical humourous and satirical prose. if you are really hounded by the enquiries mentioned above, then this book will prove an interesting read."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Many of the reviewers in this space are out of their minds!

A must-read for 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"They should have given Bellow his Nobel Prize a couple of years earlier, to avoid the aspersion this novel throws upon it. While this novel displays as well as any Bellow's stylistic fluency, the story really has no serious moral or intellectual interest, and thus the ornaments of style are wasted. The protagonist is capricious to the point of carelessness and free of the burden of any serious commitments, ethical or otherwise. He is so narcissistic that the reader is forced to doubt either his intelligence or his humanity. It would be comforting if the novel meant to expose a pathological frame of mind - albeit not of the most malignant kind - but the character's picaresque adventures, inconsequential struggles, ephemeral desires, and his shallow reflections upon them, are given far too much space for such a purpose to obtain. It is a matter of genuine puzzlement to me why Bellow chose to give such a generous platform to this impoverished character, whose moral substance is nothing beside, for instance, the much more weighty Mr. Sammler, through whom Bellow successfully accomplishes the only purpose this novel could have been meant for (and fails in), which is to examine the pressures which modern American society forces upon the articulate mind, evaluate the resulting changes in relations with others and oneself, and to convey the pathos of our failures to repair what is damaged thereby.In a word, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"A wonderful book by one of the most insightful writers of our era.

I listened to the tapes!!! I had a difficult time trying to determine whether Bellow was pulling our legs or whether he meant this work to be taken seriously. He mentions every person who wrote something that would fit into the &quot;great books,&quot; but never clarifies any meaningful concept that would be found in any of those works. Bellow had to be kidding us when he describes his sexual fantasies. These are the fantasies of a 50+ character who is supposed to be a great intellectual?? No wonder they have come up with Viagra!!! And what is all that stuff about communicating with spirits??? Is that supposed to be serious, as well. No -- Bellow was trying to do for novels what Stravinsky and Picasso did for music and painting.... One big put on!!! It must be!!!"},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is my favorite Saul Bellow novel of the several I have read. It is based on the life of the amazing poet Delmore Schwartz, and chronicles the deterioration and fall of a man of genius. Bellow obviously loved Delmore, and the protagonist in this work is viewed sympathetically, but with candor. Bellow was at the height of his powers when he wrote this fine novel. I recommend it highly for its fascinating plot, great character development, and style of prose."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I loved reading \\"Adventures of Augie March,\\" \\"Herzog\\", \\"The Deans' December, but \\"Humboldt's Gift\\" was my favorite Bellow novel. So full of rich narrative and characterizations, and like any good writer, some ambiguous passages to keep readers on their toes. All the criteria of a great novel are within it's pages - catharsis, redemption, neurosis, scholarly research, the edict of modern society to change it's ways or face annihilation. Along with Roth and Updike, Bellow has to be one of the greatest 20th century writers."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This novel won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The author was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature the same year. In reference to some of the other reviews, I would note that readers need to decide whether they want to read literature or to read brain candy. This novel is literature and requires some amount of concentrated thought. The author digresses and backtracks to fill in details of various characters. He also has a tendency to philosophize. It is past page 300 before you actually get to Humboldt's Gift. It took some effort to get into the novel but, once involved, it was worth the effort. Some parts are more interesting than others, especially the parts set in Chicago.Charlie Citrine is a writer who is at a crisis point in his life. His ex-wife is trying to strip him of everything he has. He is in trouble with the IRS over past tax returns. Investments have gone bad. He is threatened by a hoodlum, who really wants Charlie to help his wife on a PhD dissertation. He is having some conflicts with his girlfriend. He is almost out of funds, but everyone thinks he is rich.Charlie had been the protege of the poet Von Humboldt Fleisher. Humboldt had early success, than went downhill. He could be compared to Vincent Van Gogh, i.e., people were not buying his work; he was considered psychotic; and he died in poverty; but is now well regarded after his death. He was not as crazy as people thought, and he leaves a surprising legacy.The novel is a story of Charlie turning his life around, and rebounding to new found fame. He has help from Humboldt from beyond the grave."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Based on his encounters with the brilliant but doomed poet Delmore Schwartz, Humbold's Gift is like much of Saul Bellow's novels in that it's well-written and flows nicely. However, what makes it different from earlier works like \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\" is that the narrator is such a drip - a man who squanders his good fortune on bad gambling tips and dubious concubines. Bellow's characterization of the narrator Charlie Citrine is almost too convincing. Citrine becomes absolutely insufferable at times, and this makes sometimes it difficult to continue reading without wanting to slam the book down in disgust instead of reading on.However, for those with a penchant for flawed personalities - and for fans of Delmore Schwartz, there is much here to entertain."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Charles Citrine's fascination with death (although not his) seemed to pre-occupy him to the point where he was unable to understand his own living. If this is part of the main theme, Bellow succeeded in crafting ingenius moments of narrative that enlightened the reader and developed an unpredictable (somewhat meandering) plot. To many readers, this book will come off as very showy- an exercise in exhibiting how well read and studied Bellow is. In this book, if the narratives are Bellow's strength, the dialogue is his weakness. It seemed to suffer from the same malaise as the ending- it was too compact and forced - especially for a book focusing on someone that is desperately searching to lift the weight of the dead off of his shoulders. Nothing in real life (or death) is as tidy as the ending of this book."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is my first attempt at reading Bellow and I was distinctly underwhelmed at his writing style. It would be nice to round up all our contemporary novelists, sit them in a lecture hall, and explain to them in no uncertain terms that it takes more than Realism and Stream of Consciousness to make a good novel. In Bellow's case, he overdid both techniques."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I loved Bellow's two short novels, Dangling Man and Seize the Day; tightly packed, concentrated thrilling accounts of alienation. But while Humboldt's Gift begins as well, it quickly tapers off into a diffuse mass of self-indulgent, theory- dropping nonsense. I think Jame's Atlas's comment in the brand new bio of Bellow is very apt here, that Bellows, like many people from an impoverished, immigrant background, is trying too hard here to make up for the deficiencies of his youth. Detached readers have a legitimate complaint about Bellow's penchant for self-indulgence, which repeatedly pads a potentially excellent 200-pager into 300-plus page behemoth of tedium and name-dropping. A real shame, because Dangling Man and Seize the Day are American classics. The uncommitted reader may wish to start with those."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Charlie Citrine was such an incredibly tedious character that about three quarters of the way through the novel I just started skipping over his pseudo-philosophical detours. Like another reviewer mentioned, I often times would be unable to determine whether such deviations were written in a sardonic or serious tone. I came to really dislike Citrine's character by the end of the novel; sure, the guy has read a lot, but it doesn't seem like he's actually digested any of it. His thoughts and dialogue are nothing more than pretentious, name-dropping and theory-dropping gobbledygook. This man approaches problems both philosophical and practical without an ounce of logic or any attempt at coherence."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I love the exquisite irony of clearly mental midgets trying patheticallyto assualt the giant that is Saul Bellow who can say more in any oneof his stray thoughts than today's best selling authors in entire novels.One thinks of dung dazed flies buzzing over the vast corpse of a lion.Saul Bellow is our Tolstoy and Dostoyevski blended in one splendid author.He has the range of the first and the depth of the other.

Saul Bellow is not one of the best authors of the 20th century and this book is not or should not be an American classic. Bellow suffers from what I like to call the Heinlien syndrome. He wrote concise short books with good stories at the beginning of his career and then increasingly got sidetracked by ethics, morality, intellectualism, and name-dropping in his works. Not to say a great book can't contain a moral but at least concentrate on the plot and story to support the moral.This book is agonizing to read. There is no straight forward time line. The narrator skips back in forth through time to different events and memories at such a bewildering rate that it becomes a chore just to keep everything straight. That wouldn't be so bad except for the absurd conversations between Von Humboldt and Citrine. Neither of these characters came off as believable to me in the least.The central focus of the book is the relationship between Von Humboldt, a poet, and Citrine, an award winning author but the plot actually takes place after Humboldt's death. Citrine comes off as one of the stupidest intellectuals I have ever had the misfortune of reading about. The all time lamest scene is when Rinaldo, a low level thug, kidnaps Citrine and then forces him into the bathroom at gunpoint while he relieves his bowels. WTF?In short, if you want to read about the depths of the human soul you would be much better off reading Rimbaud, Celine, Sholokov, Hesse, or even Hemingway. Stay away from this author and his pretentious and absurd novels."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Saul Bellow's model for Von Humboldt Fleisher is Delmore Schwartz. The Bellow stand-in, the narrator, is Charlie Citrine. Humboldt was inspired, shrewd, nutty. The book registers the past, using flashbacks to show the life and times of Humboldt as observed by C. Citrine, and the present, detailing Citrine's encounters with the mobster-like figure, Rinaldo Cantabile. It seems that Cantabile's wife is doing a thesis on Von Humboldt Fleisher.Citrine describes Stendahl, Kierkegaard, and Baudelaire as experts on boredom. When Citrine tried to get his play into suitable shape to run on Broadway, his debut was interrupted by Humboldt telephoning the theater from Bellevue. Humboldt collected psychoanalysts and lawyers. He had no old friends, only ex-friends. Leonard Lyons wrote of Charlie Citrine, but Humboldt was famous at the White Horse Tavern. Citrine was developing the notion for his projected journal, THE ARK, that the French were especially sensitive to boredom. The Rinaldo Cantabiles of Chicago and elsewhere gave Citrine the opportunity to experience a Runyonesque life.Another of the novel's characters, Thaxter, the supposed editor of the never-to-be-issued journal, THE ARK, possesses the attributes of the fathers of Geoffrey Wolfe and John LeCarre. Citrine's friend Renata claims that Charlie is self-absorbed but doesn't know the first thing about selfishness. Melville and Poe were solitary geniuses. The truth is is that there is no literary life.Dying, Humboldt had left Kathleen, his former wife, and Charlie Citrine with copies of an outline for a movie. On the other hand, a movie script Humboldt and Charlie had completed years earlier has turned into a hit, giving Charlie another avenue to riches.Humboldt had always contended that Charlie's hit play had been based upon his portrait. Thus, Humboldt is given reburial and his old uncle receives a substantial share of the payments. The focal point of the book, the madness and accomplishments of Von Humboldt Fleisher, is surrounded amusingly by the filigree of Charlie's domestic and foreign entanglements."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"As in Bellow's &quot;Herzog&quot; and &quot;Seize the Day,&quot; the protagonist of &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; is a highly educated late-middle-aged man who's made a minor mess of his life but weathers the storm with any resources of which he can avail himself. Charlie Citrine, an Appleton, Wisconsin, native transplanted to Chicago, is an author and a briefly successful playwright who spends the novel reminiscing about his longtime friendship with the late poet Von Humboldt Fleisher, an eccentric genius and self-diagnosed manic depressive, and describing the people and events in his life that somehow seem to shape themselves around his relationship with Humboldt.Humboldt once had a goal to raise the esteem of the poet's role in American society. In 1952 he believed an Adlai Stevenson presidency would allow the involvement of more intellectuals in government; when this hope crumbled, he sought and won an ephemeral poetry chair at Princeton, where he and Citrine concocted a strangely Sophoclean movie treatment about a doomed Arctic expedition and a man who became a cannibal. This was not the last of their show business aspirations; Citrine's play, &quot;Von Trenck,&quot; based loosely on Humboldt's life and therefore vexatious to Humboldt, was a hit on the theater circuit and was made into a movie.Citrine's dubious fortune attracts all kinds of problems with love and money. His ex-wife Denise is straining him over an uncomfortable divorce settlement; his new girlfriend, a much younger woman named Renata, takes advantage of him and leaves him stranded in Madrid to babysit her son. A simple poker night results in an undesirable association with a small-time gangster named Rinaldo Cantabile from which he can't seem to extricate himself.Character creation is where Bellow really excels; he seeks the individual in every person he invents and never exploits stereotypes or resorts to caricatures for the sake of broad humor. Observe the swaggering confidence of Citrine's friend George Swiebel, an actor turned construction contractor; the smug demeanor of the dapper, cosmopolitan Thaxter, whom Citrine hires as an editor for a magazine yet (and probably never) to be published; the affectionate gruffness of Citrine's older brother Julius, a wealthy, sickly businessman who never shed his working-class sensibilities. These are people you'd be no more surprised to meet in reality than on the pages of a book.A criticism against Bellow is that he has a tendency to sacrifice cohesive plots for the random portrayal of human hysteria, a collection of disparate people thrown together haphazardly. The problem is not that his novels lack believability; rather, they are often too believable, and sometimes I think they would benefit from just a little more artifice. In that regard, &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; strikes me as one of his better novels along with &quot;Henderson the Rain King,&quot; built upon a substantial story that achieves a certain amount of closure because the protagonist is finally entrusted with a responsibility (the &quot;gift&quot;) that, handled properly, could change his life for the better."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I think this is Bellow's materwork. An author who has always searched for evidence of the human soul in contemporary society, the questions Bellow raised in each of the novels leading to this point (Herzog particularly), finally find a resolution in this book, his last novel before winning the Nobel Prize.This is a story of Charlie Citrine, a sucessful author who finds himself struggling for meaning while confronting the ghosts of memory, particularly in the relationship with his friend, mentor; and, at many points, antagonist, Von Humboldt Fletcher. Curiously, the novel is thrown into action and suspense through Citrine's dealings with a minor gangster, Cantible. The relationship, though, turns out to be one that brings Citrine back to the &quot;here and now.&quot; Just as he is on the brink of being lost in transcendental wanderings, Citrine is snapped back to his resposibility by Cantible.And, from such an unlikely source, the novel begins its reach towards resolution: to be fully human, Citrine must be spiritual but remain part of the world. Meaning and true spirituality come through compassion, empathy, caring. Once Citrine and the reader discover this, the novel reaches a resolution that marked the end of an era in many of Bellow's themes. This novel is simply a must for anyone who has enjoyed any of Bellow's earlier works, as well as for anyone who, like Chalie Citrine, struggle to find a place for the soul, the human spirit, in a world that seems to have forgotten such a thing may exist."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Transcendental. Profound. Scholarly. Challenging. Invigorating. Agile. A literary treasure. Citrine lives and breathes with the perspective of a real writer surging against great existential issues like Walt Whitman's ultimate question. Humboldt is brilliant, pitiful, hilarious and, ultimately, victorious from the grave. The gangster, Cantabile, is Citrine's cosmic foil: the Dionysius of Nietzsche to Citrine's Apollo. This is potentially a life-altering work: it can change your outlook on life and death. Bellow redeems late 20th century American literature with writing so rich it has bestowed upon him a mantle of immortality. He will be long remembered as one of America's most brilliant 20th century writers. This novel confirms Bellow's consistent gift for writing as evidenced by his prolific virtuosity in Herzog, The Adventures of Augie March and Henderson the Rain King. What a masterful literary legacy Bellow has left us! Bag the NY Times Best Seller List and Oprah's mind numbing, witless wonders and read Bellow. Hardly anything this substantive is likely to be created hereafter."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I have a hard time understanding what there is not to like about this novel. The only thing that I can think of is that it is a book very uncontemporary in its style, but I find this to be one of its greatest strengths. I find that so many contemporary fiction writers have been overwhelmed by the presence of movies and TV that they are no longer able to write novels, but instead are forced to create what amounts to screenplays without stage directions.Humboldt's Gift is not this. It takes the time to revel in the sheer joy of words. The characters are developed in depth. Bellow prevents them from becoming interchangeable, and this is as it should be, for people are not interchangeable. Bellow is obsessed with bringing every nuance and quirk of his characters to your doorstep. You could probably even pick them out on the street. What's more, Bellow has succeeded in bridging the amorphous world of high-minded ideas and the tangible world of reality with a prose style that is conversational and wise. You are learning something about what it means to be alive here. You are learning something about the breadth of the human condition. You are learning something about what it means to be American and what that means given the backdrop of the rest of history. If you would find such a journey tedious, don't bother reading this book. If you are anxious to take such a trip, take this book with you as a map.Some of Bellow's books -- Sammler's Planet and Henderson the Rain King, in parts -- can be overly pendantic and essay-ish. But not this one. This one is a masterpiece of English literature. You are missing an American experience -- love it or leave -- if you are not reading this book."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Saul Bellow's HUMBOLDT'S GIFT is one of his last major novels. It's narrated by Charlie Citrine, a writer (playwright, biographer, essayist), who's tormented by a Chicago hood, a financially-draining divorce, an unfaithful girlfriend, and the memories of his recently deceased one-time mentor and close friend Von Humboldt Fleisher (loosely based on Delmore Schwartz).There's not much action in HUMOBLDT'S GIFT. Much of the book is taken up by long passages of reminiscences, hyperactive philosophizing about the artist's--and any human's--place in modern society, and more general existential angst. These are written in furiously paced and often hilarious prose. The cadences of Bellow's sentences have unique rhythm and momentum.At the same time, this is often a deeply moving novel. Charlie is haunted throughout the book by his memories of Humboldt, and in particular the moment when he saw Humboldt--down and out--on a NYC street and avoided him. It was the last time he would see Humboldt before his death. The many emotionally-charged and elegiac reflections on Humboldt and his ambition and his friendship and his manic depression and his eventual break-up, make up the heart of the book.The first half of the novel is extremely strong. Then it tends to get a bit indulgent; the contrivences -- the character of Cantabile, for example -- begin to wear, and the penultimate change of setting to Spain seems to take the energy out of the book. Bellow's prose is often awesomely brilliant -- the language seems to jump off the page -- but it too has its moments of carelessness and self-indulgence.Ultimately, I don't think this novel is entirely successful, but it is often magical, often moving, and continually thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I read several other of Bellow's novels and frankly found none of them very memorable. I was disappointed and a bit surprised; I'd enjoyed virtually all of Roth's work and couldn't understand why Bellow left me cold. I'd started Humboldt's Gift and given it up after a hundred pages. I finally thought I'd give it another try, and I'm very glad I did. Maybe it was that I had to be in my 50's to fully appreciate a novel about a man in his 50's, facing issues that are much more remote and theoretical only ten years earlier. His use of language, which I'd never found remarkable before, is extraordinary. He grapples with psychological realities and ultimate issues with both great humor and true profundity. The characters are fully realized, and at least to me, easily recognizable among the people I've known in my own life--most certainly myself included. While it's not a short book, if you give it a chance and can relate to the main character, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is the first Bellow book I've read and I finished feeling ambivalent about his talents.Humboldt's Gift is the story of a successful writer, Charlie Citrine and his fascination with his friend the poet, Von Humboldt Fleisher. Woven within the text are his relationships with a mobster, several women, and an unreliable literary friend.Citrine is an intellectual and a thinker. Interspersed throughout the story are philosophical thoughts and conjectures about life. Sometimes these further the story or provide more depth to a character, other times they seem like extraneous rambling.The strength of the book is Citrine's strong and unique narrative voice and the portrait of literary and mob life in Chicago, New York and Europe of the 1970s.What disappointed me about the book was that the lack of a strong story line made it difficult to continue reading. I felt the same story could have been told in a few hundred fewer pages.Overall, not a terrible book, but not especially memorable."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Humbolt's Gift is a wonderful story about themes of individuality and creativity, American society in the 1940's and 50's, and about alienation. The characters are wild and eccentric. Charlie, Humbolt's hero, escapes the dominations of society through personal transcedence, but can he really? I ask. HG also brings up questions about how we are influenced by our mentors, and that sometimes we must go beyond their influence to become ourselves. I think the ending is a trick. You get the impression that Bellow wants us to think transcedence is the way, but also he puts some doubt in our minds about Charlie, can Charlie really transcend when he's filled with so much love for his fellow man. An interesting, thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Charlie Citrine's many troubles involving friends hoodlums women and the meaning of life will appeal to readers who have realized that they were more or less idiots until about the age of 40.

Humboldt's Gift proves that Great Literature can be fun to read."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I am a Bellow fan and have read 12 of his 13 novels and created an amzon guide: \\"A Guide to Reading Saul Bellow.\\"In case you are new to Bellow, his writings and themes reflect his life, his writings, and his five marriages during his five active decades of writing. He hit his peak somewhere around the time of \\"Augie March\\" in 1953 and continued through to the Pulitzer novel \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" in 1973. He wrote from the early 1940s through to 2000. His novels are written in a narrative form, and the main character is a Jewish male, usually a writer but not always, and he is living in either in New York or Chicago. Bellow wrote approximately 13 novels plus other works. Bellow progressed a long way as a writer over the five decades. This story was written at the end of the prime of his career and is nothing like the early novels \\"Dangling Man\\" or \\"The Victim\\" written 30 years earlier. Those were heavy slow reads. \\"Dangling Man\\" is often boring, and Bellow was in search of his writing style in that period of the 1940s. The present novel is light reading, written in an easy to follow style.\\"Humbolt's Gift\\" has all the trademark Bellow ingredients: a writer struggling to create his next work, a messy divorce, travel - here to Madrird, problems with money, the relationship to a wealthy brother, and a tie to a fellow writer or celebrity. Here the other writer is a former friend now dead, Von Humbolt Fleisher, a poet from Geenwich Village in New York and one time Princeton Professor. It is one of his more upbeat and entertaing novels. It has one flaw: a weak plot. Somewhere around the middle one realizes that this is all about writing and entertaining the reader with prose, and less about a coherent story. It is mostly a series of narrative stories and flashbacks, with the flow of the narrative making tangent after tangent off the main story line of the novel. The book is not as detailed nor as rich in prose as \\"Herzog,\\" which I consider to be a brilliant novel, but this present work is an entertaining and certainly an enjoyable read.The narrative is by a Bellow like character, Charlie Citrine, an older 60 something writer with a 20 something girlfriend, Renata, and a wife, Denise, seeking support payments. He is befriended by Cantabile, a Chicago minor crime figure with a Ph.D. student wife. The latter is studying Humbolt's life and works.This is an entertaing read and I recommend it as an introduction to Bellow. It is set mainly in Chicago, but has travels to Houston, New york, Paris, and Madrid. There are many flashbacks in the style of \\"Herzog\\" but it is lighter than \\"Augie March\\" and more entertaining than \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" or the later novel \\"The Dean's December.\\" Is it his best work? It is definitely one of his monumental works, and won a Pulitzer - his only one. It is not as complicated as a few of his other primary novels such as \\"Augie March\\" and \\"Herzog\\" but it is a solid 487 pages and entertaining. In reading the novel, after reading about eight other Bellow novels, it became clear to me why he was awarded the Nobel Prize and other awards. He is able to create the right balance between his narrative style, the story, the characters, the prose, and the sometimes futility of modern life.As a side note Charlie Citrine makes a number of comments on writing - which one assumes are Bellow's own philosphy - and we learn that primary is the consideration or goal to entertain. This seems to be reflected in all his novels and especially in Ravelstein, where it is hard to separate the real professor Bloom from the Ravelstein caricature.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Citrine and Humboldt, Bellow and Delmore Schwartz. This is literary fiction which continually plays with its real life parallel. But more importantly it is yet another brilliant work of one of America's great writers. Bellow can knock the reader out with a simple description or a stray thought. His idiom is such a rich one and the references to high- minded things just comes natural in it. I myself think the work gives too much time to the petty crook Cantabile and his pitiless shakedown of hero Citrine. I do not feel for Citrine the way I was led to feel for Herzog. Here so much seems random a kind of Augie March adventure taking place more in mind than in physical reality. Still the work is Bellow and brilliant. And its insights into the literary world make one appreciate just how hard it is to really get anywhere in it."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Bellow brings forth another of his ragged souled protagonists. Intellectual dreamers, lost in the turbulence of the American 20th Century. Charlie Citrine is a historian of ideas, obsessed with literature, poetry and ideas and the legacy of his poet friend, the legendary Von Humboldt.As a cruel reminder of how America can break its most sensitive artists (witness the tragic David Foster Wallace), Humboldt is a warning backdrop to the whole novel. A feted success in his day, he winds up in mental turmoil chewing on pretzels in a New York flophouse while Citrine flies overhead in a helicopter, flush with the success of a Broadway play.Citrine struggles with this particularly American dilemma - to use his mind for material success, knowing in his heart it doesn't achieve the beauty and spiritual fulfilment he craves in his wild philosophical monologues, riven with the inspirations of thinkers such as George Steiner.Meanwhile, the real world dilemmas of his mid life unfold in Chigago - that brutal, steel pressed, mercantile city. His wife is divorcing him and cleaning him out, he is hustled by a reckless gangster Rinaldo Cantabile who pursues him through bath house, toilet stall, skyscraper construction and Citrine's apartment to tap into his intellectual resources and try and make a fast buck. If this wasn't enough, he is involved with an elusive and manipulative young Latin woman, Renata - a distinct copy of Ramona from Herzog - in the typical middle aged man's doomed pursuit to regain his youth through sex.At one point Citrine focuses on how to live a life of the mind where there is no culture. And this is the key dilemma Bellow grapples with in so much of his fiction. The plot - Humboldt's eponymous gift - is ultimately fairly inconsequential. But this big novel is worth reading for its mature treatment of middle aged American masculinity, power and artistic struggles."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Having read Mr. Sammler's Planet, I had high hopes for this novel.I pictured something loaded with insight and jewels of descriptions on every page. This book has scant few of these things and lots of name dropping, rambling unconvincing philosophy, and boring characters...(Where are all the wonderful characters in Sammler's Planet?).In short it is a dud and long. I especially liked the commentator who said realism and stream of thought do not automatically produce a good novel.Where's the beef?"},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"What a read! and listen. I simultaneously read and listened to this book on tape. And that was a good way to get through it and appreciate it. Fabulous combination of James Joyce and Woody Allen. This book won the Pulitzer (1976) and that same year Bellow won the Nobel Prize. Surely Cantabile is one of the most marvelous characters in all literature."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I'm not up to the long discussion this book deserves but will say that for every element of it that is sublime and breathtakingly novel, there are corresponding parts that are tedious and self-conscious.

My problem with the novel is that I felt that I was wading through endless digressions and pretentious ruminations of the main character Charlie Citrine to get to the hidden gems. I struggled to finish this and frankly wouldn't recommend it. Citrine in the end is neither a believable or sympathetic character and his inner dialogue becomes a study in boredom. Since at one point he goes into great detail to discuss boredom in modern life maybe that was the point. I almost felt like the author was intentionally testing the readers ability to endure the pacing of this book."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Humboldt's Gift is a disappointing foray into what could have been a deeply moving meditation on The Big Issues. But it fails, primarily due to the laughably narcissistic and irritating nature of the faux-intellectual narrator, Charlie Citrine.So ridiculous and UNintellectual is Citrine (unless regurgitating, in vastly dumbed-down fashion, the theories, thoughts and theses of great Western minds qualifies as intellectual) that I wasn't at all certain Bellow intended Citrine to be taken seriously. Except that he's neither comical nor satirized. Charlie and Humboldt are both classically well-educated, but neither manages to move beyond the syllabus and into the realm of truly creative thought.Citrine is nothing more than a shallow, pseudo-intellectual in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Okay, even shallow, pseudo-intellectuals are entitled to their crises, but dressing them up in existential stoles and passing them off as profound doesn't work.Bellow's prose, however, is lovely as always."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Humboldt's Gift is one of the greatest American novels of the XX century; I have confirmed it myself after reading and rereading it. And as it's expected with a major work like this, many have complained about it. Really I have nothing to criticize this book, but I would have put more descriptions in it. Anyway, the use of literary technical devices (as Bellow was aware of this) for making the prose alive is superb.A story as this had to be told in the First Person narrative voice. The novel is mostly retrospective, and the speaker, Charlie Citrine, the typical consonant/dissonant narrator. One begins to read it and seems like a dreary ocean of words: there are no chapter numbers, anything but spaces, to tell you that something had just been said. Anyway, these spaces separate the meditations of Charlie on Von Humboldt, his many women, some major parts of his life... like pauses, from one thought or remembrance to the another... But what is the present of this novel that takes us to review Citrine's life since the 1930s? You really can't easily find it, but the \\"narrative present\\" consists only of four months (from December 1973 to April 1974). The rest of the novel's temporal structure lingers between the 1930-40s (when Citrine's friend, von Humboldt, was at the peak of his career), the 1950s and from there on.So, much happens during the four winter months of 1973-1974, but is little told, because the account of the past will complete it all... His remembering of his past, Charlie Citrine's own account, its furious and full of anecdotes, and Bellow's continuous scene changes help us to be entertained permanently. Not expect to find an ordered restrospective of a life here: the book is quite inductive, built from particular bits to finally give a whole panorama of a life. Memories come and go, and later are completed; we happen to be reading a passage in 1956, but then we are back ton 1974, and then back to WWII time. Past events are simply evoked through the exercise of voluntarily recalled memories: Bellow collects them as they are pertinent to the story, bit by bit, so you don't know everything until you have read the whole book.So why to read this book that seems so monstrous in size and so difficult at first glance? Well, it's worth the tour through America's last 60 years of existence. And it's also a way to understand better Saul Bellow, as a writer, an intellectual and a human being. There is so much faith and hope in this book that you can compare to Henderson The Rain King or The Adventures of Augie March, both picaresque-like. It's a page-turner, something rare to find in a pure literature roman. And not that boring (not in theme, but in prose), as The Victim, or Dangling Man. But among all, it's beautiful, because is us, humans, and Bellow knows how depict our flaws and virtues in an almost unnoticed manner; he is a master of depicting naturally human life.Writers physically die, but prevail in their books. Joseph Brodsky once said that the battle against time was always going to be won by writers and poets. Saul Bellow, who passed out in 2005, has prevailed.This is not a book to relax; is one to read and enjoy, because an individual's life story is not relaxing; in fact, can be dissappointing."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This novel is a well-fitting companion to those who often nurture thoughts of the meaning of death, e.g., how our knowledge of its certainty affects our daily lives. Charles Citrine is displaced from normalcy at this point in his life and suffers greatly for it. His only excuse is that he spends his time musing over more &quot;important&quot; things than his personal life and finances. He is Humboldt's protege, but he never realizes the same greatness."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"In HUMBOLDT'S GIFT (1975), Bellow starts with the character Von Humboldt Fleisher, who is a rich and contradictory personality. He's brilliant about high culture but fascinated and informed about low culture; he's benevolent and caring but also a bully; he is committed to high-minded pursuits but also wants money and success; he's impractical yet also shrewd and litigious; he feels qualified to advise the President but ends in a flophouse. For about 200 pages, Humboldt is like a great glitter ball rotating above a dance floor, with each flash of Bellow's light creating a subsidiary character that has elements of Humboldt's immense personality. He's the big tent. All other characters are inside.But then, we're in Chicago, more than a decade after Humboldt's death, and in the life of Charlie Citrine, the narrator of this book and Humboldt's buddy. For this time and place, Bellow once again creates characters that are reflections of elements in Humboldt's personality. But these are not just canny explorations of Humboldt's contradictory needs and values. Instead, the characters tend to be extreme parodies of elements in Humboldt and explode the book's character-based structure. While they make sense in Charlie's out-of-control life, the personalities and shenanigans of the characters Cantabile, Thaxter, and Renata are grotesque or hurtful variations of forces within Humboldt and mismatched with the start of the book. It's Humboldt-gone-wild. As a result, the final 280 pages of HUMBOLDT'S GIFT reads like Bellow has no structure. While a lot happens, this part of the book seems undisciplined and sometimes arbitrary and very very long.There are, by the way, many similarities between HUMBOLDT'S GIFT and the great HERZOG (1964). In each there is a brilliant and successful male protagonist, a crazy ex-wife, interaction with cops that involves a gun, and so on. Each book even has a character with a limp. Just speculating here: but surely Bellow was aware of these similarities. So in HUMBOLDT'S GIFT, maybe he decided to explode already strong character into grotesque parody. This is the opposite of HERZOG, where continuums of character narrow to sanity.HUMBOLDT'S GIFT is a long but worthwhile journey. It helps to show why Bellow is a great author."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"A warning to anyone thinking of buying this book: stiftle the urge, borrow it from a library, if you must. I agree with three out of seven reviewers here who have panned the book. This deserves the word &quot;bloviated,&quot; if it exists. Having spent some time this year reading some &quot;classics&quot; of 20th c. American lit, I can say this is the worst. A huge bore."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Charles Citrine is an author. The man isn't stupid. Yet, like other leading characters in Saul Bellow's books, he lives his life in a foolish way. He has the kind of friends who eliminate the need for enemies. If he had a dog it would bite him daily, and he'd feed it.The title character, Humboldt, is another writer, suffering from manic depression at a time when lithium wasn't widely prescribed. His gift to Citrine is a manuscript, and is left to Citrine after Humboldt's death. The manuscript turns out to be valuable, but I doubt that it will straighten out Citrine's life. He can be counted on to insure himself a complicated and unsatisfying life. It's frustrating to read about this intelligent dope."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"\\"Humboldt's Gift is a slice-of-life novel with undertones of dark comedy. From the perspective of Charlie Citrine, a poet and essayist of considerable success, it examines life in America from the 1930s through the mid-1970s. Much of the novel consists of Charlie's memories of his childhood in Chicago and his days in Greenwich Village with his mentor, Von Humboldt Fleischer, who has already descended into madness and death at the time of the telling. Charlie is driven throughout the novel by memories and recriminations of Humboldt.\\"Citraine intersperses his reveries over Fleischer with his adventures or incidents with Rinaldo Cantabile, a try hard mobster who attaches himself to Citraine after a card game.This is wonderfully written and gives a fine view of America into the early '70's with the start of the celebrity culture. The novel was published first in 1975.Charlie is too weak for my liking wandering through life semi-detached due to his success- he has money troubles, women troubles, gangster troubles - all due to his desire that all life should be \\" nice\\" \\"artistic\\", for a want of better words. In the end Charlie was frustrating, he needed a good slap to bring him back to the real world.But in saying this, I will read this again, it is great and I can see why Bellow is Martin Amis's hero and I can also see why Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities is very similar, a man completely out of touch with what is happening about him.There is several layers to everything written in this novel and I was not able to comprehend them all at the first go, but I will go back as there is much more to get from this."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Humboldt's Gift showcases Bellow at his very best. There are the long digression we find in his other work; but in Gift, they are somehow more relevant and soothing. Bellow takes all the threads of his story and ties them together in a way he does not in many of his longer works. On completing this novel, there is no feeling that something has been left undone; the author has accomplished what he wanted to do and we know it. And most astonishing of all, Humboldt's Gift makes grand and lofty statements about the American condition without sounding self-conscious, righteous or preachy. Bellow created a novel with the American moral tone of a great work by Melville, James, Twain or Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"If you ever doubt about why you decided to devote your life to business, law or any other money-making but potentially mind-killing job, why you disregared your love for poetry, then read this book, and compare Humboldt to Charlie Citrine.."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Saul Bellow writes not only about what takes place in the story, but about what takes place in his mind.

Do not deprive yourself of this great treat.Yes, there are many references, but Bellow is child of culture, and what can a writer write about except about his experience, the time he lives in, and the people and books that influenced him along the way? Bellow has great experiences to write about, and knows a great deal about the culture in which he grew up. Phenomenal amount."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"The Humboldt of the title is Von Humboldt Fleisher, an American poet, but he is not the main character; indeed, he is already dead by the beginning of the novel. The main character is Charlie Citrine, a one-time friend of Humboldt, who has himself enjoyed success as a writer of plays and biographies, but who in late middle age is going through something of a crisis in his life. His inspiration has dried up, he is divorced and enmeshed in a bitter lawsuit with his ex-wife Denise over alimony, his new and much younger girlfriend Renata seems to be just as mercenary as Denise and he has become involved with a petty gangster named Rinaldo Cantabile. He is proud of the fact that he has been awarded the French Legion of Honour, but his pride is diminished when he learns that he holds the lowest grade of the order, the sort of award that would be given to a successful pig-breeder or the inventor of an improved type of dustbin. Many of Charlie's thoughts dwell on his youth and his friendship with Humboldt, even though that friendship ended acrimoniously when Humboldt took offence at a character in one of Charlie's plays whom he believed to have been based on himself. Humboldt, in fact, was widely seen as a failure by the end of his life. Once regarded as a poet of brilliant promise, he became a mentally unstable alcoholic, and Charlie is haunted by fears that his life will also end in failure, until he receives an unexpected legacy- the \\"Gift\\" of the title- from Humboldt.Saul Bellow writes with great fluency and his prose reads easily. I would agree with the reviewer who said that character creation is where Bellow excels, because the book contains some memorable characters- the tormented, self-destructive Humboldt, Denise, the sort of woman who wants to be divorced from her husband but not from his bank account, Charlie's philistine businessman brother Julius, Charlie's friend Pierre Thaxter, forever taking money off him for a projected literary magazine that will probably never see the light of day, and the comically blustering Cantabile. Above all, there is Charlie himself, who narrates the story in the first person. (The novel can be seen both as a character study of a modern American intellectual and as a satire on the twentieth-century literary establishment). Charlie's crisis is not just emotional and financial but also spiritual; the more serious side of the novel concerns his search for a philosophical or metaphysical meaning to life. Many of Charlie's observations on life, such as his musings on the role of boredom in politics, struck me as either pertinent, or amusing, or both.My main criticism of the novel is that it lacks a coherent plot. I found the first half of the book particularly meandering and diffuse, often confusing as it switched back and forth between the details of Charlie's mid-life crisis and his earlier life. It is not until quite late in the novel that we learn the details of the \\"gift\\" that is to transform his life. The second half was more satisfactory, but even here there were some tiresome parts, such as the subplot in which Charlie is abandoned in Madrid by Renata who has jilted him for an undertaker. Even the character of Cantabile, at first entertaining, became rather tiresome later on. Despite the author's fluent prose style and his powers of characterisation, this lack of a strong plot meant that I often found it a difficult read."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This 1976 Pulitzer Prize in Letters winner is a literary treat for the serious reader. This thought-provoking novel by Saul Bellow shows his stylistic fluency and insight into the characters he invents. Charlie Citrine, the narrator of this story, struggles to find a place for soul and spirit. Charles is an anti-hero with an altogether flawed personality. He is capricious, narrcissistic, shallow and an impoverished character which, of course, makes for a hilarious protagonist. He squanders a fortune, gambles badly, and makes bad choices for lovers and friends.This story is best understood as a parody of the intellectial life-style. Charlie's hapless encounters with an exwife who is draining him, a girlfriend who strands him with her son while she runs off to marry a mortician, and his relationship with Rinaldo Contabile, a minor league mafioso, all lend to making this a most memorable read. Other characters are richly portrayed; Swiebel, actor turned construction contractor, Thaxter, hired to edit a never-to-be-published magazine, and Julius, older brother to Charlie and in most every way a perfect opposite to Charlie in philosophy, lifestyle, and ambitions.While this is not an easy read it is a rewarding piece for the thoughtful reader. It is best enjoyed by the reader who is in tune with the satirical tone of the work."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Saul Bellow. What a book it is!! I strongly recommend it on two levels. First Mr. Bellow is a master of the language. His descriptions are so unique. I am afraid to mention them here because I don't want to spoil them for you. I will share one of my many favorite lines from the book. At one point, he describes an old man as having &quot;a head like a blown dandelion.&quot; How on earth did he come up with such a terrific description. This book is filled with lines like that.The book also has a great story. It in fact reminds me of another favorite book &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot; This is, in a sense, a more serious look at the same type of character as the main character in &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot; Humbolt himself is a provocative character, but then there is the reaction to him by the people around him. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Humboldt's gift (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"\\"Humboldt's Gift\\" is a steady unresolved current of introspective reconciliation, punctured occasionally by a rock of solid plot. This is less a complaint than an observation. One's enjoyment of the novel depends heavily on the reader's intellectual and spiritual commonalities with the somberly bewildered narrator, Charlie Citrine, whose multi-dimensional qualities are drawn at the expense of others I might have expected from a personality such as his. As such, the nature of Bellow's novel, at least the nature presented us, was, to me, uneven.In glass-cut prose, where every sentence is a fine trinket, Bellow unfolds a world of tensions, and shows how such tensions have manifested uniquely in Citrine. \\"Humboldt's Gift\\" is, in fact, one man's long conversation with himself, fed by material from which he is trying desperately to detach through New Age-like principles. It is here where Bellow was either a success or a failure; Citrine *is* detached, yet we aren't entirely sure if he has achieved the spiritual disjunct sought or if he is spiraling further into a depressive self-loathing. Most money might be on the latter, but Bellow keeps it relatively vague. Despite hundreds of pages of his voice, we are not really plunged into Citrine. For a Pulitzer Prize winner with a clear knowledge of and respect for the powers of literature, he betrays a remarkable lack of passion for his craft. It seems his prior works were more accidental bodily functions than labors of blood and sweat.One of the grand themes of \\"Humbolt\\" is the still-relevant (now even more so) tensions between the commercial artist and the Artist. Both sides are more or less personified in the novel: the former as the hapless gangster Cantabile, the latter as the titular Humbolt, Citrine's beloved but deeply flawed late mentor. While Citrine expounds often on art in America, quoting names along the way, these tensions aren't nearly as palpable in the novel as one might expect, particularly because, as mentioned prior, Citrine seems to no longer care much about his work. More could have been confronted head-on, with direct action, or direct thought. The title refers ostensibly to a physical gift, but one could posit that it belongs just as much to Humboldt's legacy of belief that art can literally save souls, save a country, save the world. I wish Citrine had realized this on a more conscious level."},{"Title":"Meeting Prehistoric Man","review":"Meeting Prehistoric Man by GHR Von Koenigswald is a journey throughout the world in discovery of early man as paleoanthropologists understood him during VonKoenigswald's time, circa 1950's (the bookhomo erectusNariokotome Boywas written in 1956). Because the early iterations of man's genus, Homo, was widely spread throughout the world, Koenigswald took his research to those disparate locations, in search of what our progenitors were truly like.* to Java where a 1.8 million year old skullcap of a young boy was discovered in 1936 (Mojokerto child). The youngster suffered a violent death--the hind part of the skull was crushed by a mighty blow and in places the bones were not broken, but telescoped one over the other as is only possible with fresh bone. The upper jaw was also broken. Scientists speculate he might have been killed by Gigantopithecus (a pre-human species). This was followed up by Eugene Du Bois' discovery of Pithecanthropus erectus, or Java Man, what DuBois considered the missing link but turned out to be a wonderful representation of Homo erectus.* to China where he discovered 1.8 million year old bones of Gigantopithecus, a giant pre-Australopithecus early man. This is also where the 800,000 year old bones of Lantian Man were discovered in the Shaanxi province* to South Africa where the 2 million year old bones of an Australopithecine were found in a limestone cave called Sterkfontain Cave. Dubbed Mrs Ples, this is the world's most complete skull of Australopithecus africanus, and were discovered by Dr Robert Broom and John Robinson in April 1947.* To Europeo to Sussex Forger and Lascaux Caveo More recently, Gran Dolina in Spain has been a site of an 800,000 year-old shelter inhabited by Homo antecessor. These representatives of early man present some spectacularly \\"modern\\" characteristics, particularly its face, together with other traits which are very similar to those of Homo ergaster. The Gran Dolina face is almost like our own: flat and very gracile.* to East Africa where a plethora of early man's bones have been found over time, most after Von Koenigswald's work there, most during the Leakey's groundbreaking research in Olduvai Gorge. These include:o Turkana Boy (1.6 million year old Homo ergaster. This early man had no apelike reliance on trees. His narrow pelvis and barrel-like chest emphasize bipedalism. A narrow pelvis in females implies a constricted birth canal, limiting the amount of brain growth before birth, and prolonging infancy, as in modern humans. A reduced digestive tract indicates a diet containing more meat and tubers.o Nariokotome Boy , discovered by a team led by R. Leakey and A. Walker in 1984 (well after Von Koenigswald was there). This is the most complete early human skeleton ever discovered. The specimen was dated to 1.6 myr, and is considered by some as ergaster, but to most researchers it is erectus. The relative completeness of this specimen allowed detailed examination of the anatomy of erectus, and has led to many influential ideas about this species. It is the skeleton of a 10-12 year old individual (generally considered male). The teeth are unworn. Shovel-shaped incisors. Nariokotome Boy was 5'3\\" (168 cm) tall at death, and may have been as tall as 6'0\\" (183 cm) if it had reached maturity. His cause of death is unknown but there are no signs of trauma or toothmarks that might be due to his being killed by a predator.

And the answers he received to the questions 'Where do I come from?', 'What is man?', although they made him poorer by a few illusions, gave him in compensation a knowledge of his past that is vaster than he could ever have dreamed. For it emerged that the history of life was his history too.* As late as 1650, Archbishop Ussher of Ireland said that our earth was created on Oct. 4, 4004 b.c.* Today, hippos are confined to Africa, but as fossils they also occur in Europe, India and Java.* A single discovery may change the whole state of affairs* To judge by the thigh bones, Peking Man was about five feet two inches tall in the case of the male with the female some five inches less* After all this, there could be no doubt that the orangutan, which is today confined to Borneo and Sumatra, was originally a native of China as well.* the region of Borneo was somehow connected with Asia. Java itself lay beneath the sea until towards the end of the Tertiary.As an aficionado of early man, I found this book highly readable, just detailed enough to learn from without the complicated jargon that only a PhD in paleoanthropology can understand."},{"Title":"Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel","review":"The book came on time and in good condition.My late mother recommended this book.

Herbs where given just down right ridiculous meanings, half truths, or down right lies.The book is good for medical uses, but for God sake don't go bringing out your cauldron mixing up potions with this information.I'll give the author 2 stars for the medical uses but that's about it!"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"Perhaps descent enough for a beginner; but devasting and unsatisfactory for an advance or an expert.

This book stays on my bookshelf, one of the wisest purchases I've made yet!!"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"As somebody just getting into the field of herbalism, this book has proven invaluable. With convenient indices, an easy to read layout, and a very distinct separation between the remedial and magickal uses of the herbs contained within, it has proven to be a great introductory study guide, and one which I do not foresee myself outgrowing any time in the immediate future. Combined with a more exhaustive herbal guide, this can potentially be a lifelong reference for your entire practice as an herbalist."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"I got this book when it first came out, a long time ago. I was surprised back then about how much information it had and thought it was a great addition to my herbal collection. I still after all of these years keep referring back to it, and it is the one I grab first. This book does have some small inaccuracies but not enough to keep you from using it. As with any herb book make sure you check uses and information in many resources, new information is found all the time. The information is invaluable. Also remember to talk to your doctor about any herbs you use, these should be considered medicine and can effect the prescriptions you use.I would buy another copy of this book in a heartbeat. :)"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I bought this book, in addition to others on herbalism.

It is a great pleasure to read this book and discover the lore together with the remedial uses, all beautifully presented with a wealth of lovely illustrations. Each herb is carefully described and lovingly presented. The long section on the herbalist as magickal practitioner is useful as well as interesting. The appendices are very helpful and the thoroughness of this book is demonstrated throughout all of its well written pages."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"Even though this book was first published in 1984, it is still as valuable today as it was the moment the first copy came off the presses. Providing us with a sophisticated explanation of and introduction to herbology (as well as an encyclopedia and general reference guide), Beryl goes above and beyond any other book on the subject devoted to the advanced beginner by creating a work that will serve as an indispensable reference for the remainder of one's career as an herbalist. Teaching herbs as they have been used in folk magic by our ancestors, he embraces the inseparable nature of medicinal herbalism and magical herbalism, imparting to the reader the value of both the historical and modern-day-adaptable perspective that lays within. He provides us with an unparalleled reference of terminology pertinent to herbology, and teaches us to understand different herb classifications. He tells us the lore of the herbs. He even discusses the magical energies of some different stones, and devotes an entire chapter to Herbs and the Tarot. This is the best book on herbalism I have ever encountered, and it is so full of dimension and contains so much raw info that it requires many hours of study to master. If you are looking for just one good book on herbalism, make this the one!"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"While not as comprehensive in the number of herbs covered as Scott Cunningham's _Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs_, it more than makes up for that lack by his in-depth coverage of the herbs he *does* include. And he still covers plenty of herbs, enough to suit any magical situation. He does go into remedial uses as well, but this is not the focus of the book. If your looking for that sort of herbal info, I'd go elsewhere, although the information he gives is very useful and pretty thorough.There are also sections on astrological aspects of herbs, how to consecrate herbal preparations and amulets, the use of stones in connection with herbs, methods of preparation for remedial use, classification of remedial herb by effect, correspondances to deities, and lists of herbs appropriate to various ritual observances such as the holidays and handfastings.This is a book I have turned to, for a wide range of information, so often I have literally worn my copy out. I would like to see future editions with more herbs included, not because the number is insufficient. But because he is so insightful, and with such interesting little &quot;a*ha*!&quot; tidbits of information, I find myself wondering what his comments would be on various herbs he has not written about. He is a Wiccan Priest, so he is in tune with that sort of gentle sensiblility, yet his information crosses all lines of religion, to focus on the herbs themselves. He seems to write from long years of experience, not just of repeating lore found in other books. I highly recommend it, particularly to Neo-Pagan herbalists."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"After 17 years I still find this book not only an invaluable reference book, but a thoroughly enjoyable read as well.Other books may feature a more exhaustive list of herbs, but none present the herbs with the love, care and extensive background as this fine guide does. The author gives life and history to each one, presenting the herbs with the honor, and respect they deserve. (In the same vain the author includes a decent guide to magickal stones with the same loving care given to the details of each.)If you are new to herbalism or Paganism, I can't say enough about the importance of having this book for your collection."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive books on magical herbalism I have read to date. The one drawback is the insufficient cross-references to herbs known by multiple names, including the failure to list the scientific name with each entry. This is vital if you plan on ingesting any herb(s) listed."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"Owning just about every herbal book on the market right now, I can say with confidence that this is one of the best, and by far, my favorite! Paul's work is, as always, thorough, well researched, and infused with Spirit. He has referenced and cross-referenced everything, and covers enough plants for anyone to work with for a long time. His way of writing makes you feel as though a Wise Sage has gently taken you by the hand, and is leading you down a beautiful garden path, teaching you the meaning and usages of every plant you find along the way. This volume is so complete in that it touches on every aspect of working with plants from classifications to correspondences to remedial use to energetics and ceremonial usages. My favorite parts of this book are the sections on the plants themselves, how to use them and make them into medicines, and then the energetic usages, including astrological and tarot correspondences. I really loved the section on the ritual use of herbs. If you can only buy one book on plants, plant medicine, and working with plant energies...start with this one...it's a beautiful work!"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"This is an excellent and very well written book to be used as a reference guide with regards to the remedial and magical use of many common herbs.

It is a must have for any Wiccan and anyone with an interest in Magick."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"This is an AMAZING book on both the metaphysical/magickal and medicinal/holistic properties of a variety of herbs. It was written at the same time as Cunningham's Herbal Encyclopedia (AKA the BIBLE!), and independently from his works. It includes things Cunningham's does not, and vice-versa. The two are complimentary and should NOT sit on a Pagan's bookshelf alone. I regret not discovering this until just now! Recommended HIGHLY.OakRaven"},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"After years of reading old, really bad ,and hemp crowd herb books,I stumbled into this book. It completely changed my life. It is straight forward and direct with a touch of humor. It confirmed my suspision that I was on the right path, and more importantly, provided direction from an author whom I know practices what he preaches. Anything Paul writes is a must read. He makes learning the craft feel obvious."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"I have repeatedly heard nothing but good things about this book from others involved in herbalism and the use of herbs in a neopagan manner. I finally broke down and purchased a copy for myself as a Yule gift, and I was not disappointed at all. The book contains handy references according to traditional magical uses for the herbs described, in addition to traditional medicinal uses for the herb. I find that this book expounds upon information one might have already gathered from other books on the subject of magickal herbalism, but is also handy for a beginner in that everything is clearly explained and at no time is the language as such to lose or confuse a beginner.I seriously recommend this book and the author to anyone interested in the subject of herbalism and magickal uses of herbs. I look forward to adding another well-reviewed title by this author on the subject to my collection soon. If you loved Cunningham's Encylopedia of Magical Herbs, you simply MUST add this to your library as a companion edition. The two books work well together."},{"Title":"The Master Book of Herbalism","review":"This invaluable book was given to me by a mentor when I was in my late teens and a newbie many years ago; it has remained the most used herbal in my collection!

This guide has an extensive list of catalog numbers, which will help you determine the recording dates of your records."},{"Title":"Science Fiction Television (The Praeger Television Collection)","review":"I bought this book for a \\"history of sci-fi television\\" class and had to read pretty much the entire book throughout the term. The book has a lot of information and the author definitely has a grasp on the subject but the way the book is written is very \\"meh\\". Most chapters simply consist of the author recounting or summarizing plots from various tv episodes with little else in the way of info. If you are looking for a book that is more history and behind the scenes oriented about sci-fi then pass on this. If you want a book that quickly spoils the plot of every sci-fi series but accurately summarizes entire seasons in a few chapters then this is your best bet.Also whatever typeface they used for the body copy of this book is horrendous. In combination of a wacky font and much too tight of leading you will quickly find your eyes strained and overwhelmed. Poorly designed interior. Decent looking dust jacket. 2/5 for book design as well."},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"In this modern era, elves fare poorly. Creatures of light, the air is no longer clean to them, and they are too crowded by human construction. Atlendor's people are on their way north beyond the Bannawg to far Prydein, to aid the last kingdom of the elves. But they must stop to rest and recover with Cadellin Silverbrow in the caves of the Fundindelve. And thus unsuspecting, they are drawn into battle when the Brollochan, an ancient terror, is inadvertently set free.In this is the sequel to 'The Wierdstone of Brisingamen' we finds young Susan and her brother Colin still staying at Highmost Redmanhey. Their time with Gowther and Bess Mossock in Cheshire has been peaceful since the defeat of Selena Place (the Morrigan). Now that time comes to an end, when, seeking to speak with Cadellin, they become part of the hunt for the Brollochan. For the first time they meet with Albanac, one of the elder men, and the dwarf, Uthecar Hornskin. And proud Atlendor who is impatient to continue north.Shortly thereafter, the Brollochan seizes control of Susan's body, and it is only by virtue of her bracelet, the Mark of Fohla, that it is driven off. Then Colin must undertake a quest along the old, straight track to find the magic that will bring Susan back to the living. But unlike the first volume in this series, this time there is a price for the use of Angharad Goldenhand's bracelet. It calls on an older magic than that of Cadellin, and soon ancient forces walk the land. And this is only the beginning, as the children find they must once again do battle with the Morrigan to protect the human world from the dark powers that lurk on its edge.Once again, Alan Garner creates a world half from his own imagination and half from the vivid tales and legends of the British countryside. Evil palugs and fierce bodachs course through the night in a landscape filled with strange places and names that seem to have double and triple meanings. Best of all, the Old Magic is awakened, and the Wild Hunt rides again. There is so much in this short volume that the reader is literally stunned into belief.Garner does not people his books with an excess of characters, and all, from Colin to Cadellin are larger than life. Everyone plays true to archetype, but all are individuals with their own wisdom. And so there are few players that one cannot come to love. In a tale that is a conflict between good and evil, Garner does not let the good become shallow or too monochromatic. The Moon of Gomrath is a powerful story at all levels, from child's adventure to morality play, and resonates long after the last page is turned. Garner proves once again that magic is never really lost."},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"Perhaps the biggest problem with Alan Garner's Alderly tales is that there are only two. Rich in mythology and haunting magic, these stories are a must-read for fantasy fans, especially those seeking something different than the usual sword-and-sorcery fare.The story picks up not long after the events of &quot;Weirdstone of Brisingamen,&quot; with Colin and Susan encountering magical creatures yet again. While walking in the woods, they encounter an elf named Atlendor and a dwarf called Uthecar, near where Cadellin the wizard guards the sleeping knights. (For a better explanation, read the first book) The lios-alfar (elves) are migrating to Alderly, because a mysterious force is causing some of them to vanish, and Atlendor the elf king is bringing his people together to gather what magic he can. Unfortunately, proximity to the ugly constructions of humans is causing the &quot;smoke sickness&quot; in the elves, and Uthecar asks that Susan lend him the bracelet that Angharad Goldenhand gave her.But Susan is suddenly kidnapped by an evil force, and reappears quiet and strange. She has been taken over by the evil Brollachan, and the dwarves and Cadellin are able to help Colin restore her to normality -- though she will never be quite the same. Unfortunately, evil is still stirring in the form of the Morrigan and her sinister cohorts. And when Susan and Colin light a fire to keep warm on a hill, they inadvertantly set off the band of magical horsemen, the Wild Hunt...There is no lag in quality in &quot;Moon of Gomrath,&quot; and perhaps the biggest flaw is that to understand anything at all, you need to read the first book. Such things as the lios-alfar, Cadellin and his knights, Angharad Goldenhand and the bracelet, and the kids' relationship with all of the above.This is not a retread of the first book, either. Instead of the hideous svart-alfar (goblins), this time we focus on the beautiful lios-alfar. These &quot;elves of light&quot; are as entrancing as Tolkien's elves, though significantly shorter and slighter. The descriptions of their smoke-sickness is heartrending, as their &quot;changing&quot; from what we think of as life is saddening. Cadellin and the dwarves are featured less prominently than in &quot;Weirdstone,&quot; though we do have the evil Pelis the False adding a little spice to the dwarves as a whole. Other creatures are added, such as the bizarre bodachs and the savage palugs.The elves are not the only sad things about this book, and that give it the feeling of a book for older kids. We are told that if someone wears Angharad Goldenhand's bracelet it &quot;leads her ever further from human life,&quot; and that someone who uses a certain object &quot;may not know peace again, not in the sun's circle or in the darkling of the world.&quot;The writing is still quite formal, but evocative of the landscapes and the various unusual creatures present in it. Garner is among the most talented of the minimalist fantasy writers, and he never overburdens the reader with too much information. Colin and Susan are the same excellent characters, but in a sense they, too, are older as they seem to be growing into individual personalities. That doesn't stop them from inadvertantly causing a lot of trouble. The Morrigan is hideous and malevolent, needless to say, and Cadellin is the same wise and thoughtful wizard as in the previous book.Perhaps the worst thing is that there is no third Alderly tale to look forward to. But the two that exist are some of the best fantasy ever penned."},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"The moon of Gomrath is part of a duology along with the very highly recommended 'Weirdstone of Brisingamen'.I first read this book over 20 years ago, and having picked up a copy recently was as enchanted now as then.Garner's greatest strength as a writer (personal opinion) has been his ability to describe, to evoke the mood and time and place for his fantasy - and by doing so to juxtapose the real and fantasy elements of his world in a way that makes both seem somehow more real than either would be alone.In addition, if you move past his technical craftsmanship, he has managed to bring the world of Celtic myth to life in a way and with a realism that I have never seen equalled.Ignoring both of those factors, the two books comprise a fantastically good read that I couldn't possibly put down.My only regret in reading these books, is that given the time since their origional publication it seems unlikely that there will ever be a third, and there VERY definitely needs to be - there was too much story still to be told.Read, enjoy, love - I did!I must correct one thing in my review above - at the end of August 2012 the third volume in the series, BONELAND, will be published. Even with a space of some 40 years, I couldn't possibly be more eager!!!"},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"This powerful tale of magic old and new, low and high, is as fiery as the wendwood burning on Alderly on the Eve of Gomrath. A little scary for the very young child, but brought this ten year old (as I was) to tears and thrills by turns! I still search for elves among the treetops, and I am very careful which wood I burn and when!"},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"This is the second in Garner's ALDERLEY books, and can certainly be read alone -although one will perhaps do better by beginning with THE WEIRDSTONE OF BRISINGAMEN. In both books we are given a wonderful mix of the magic and the &quot;real&quot; and invited to share in a world that seems to hover at the edge of peripheral vision. MOON is perhaps a bit &quot;older&quot; than WEIRDSTONE, my Clare admitted to being scared by some of the things that happen to the children around whom the book spins, and there is a feeling that Garner is perhaps aiming more at early teens, but Clare was enthralled with the book at six and wanted to hear it again at eight &amp; I suspect I will catch her reading it when she is twelve, and we will still be talking about it when we are both much much older."},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"The Moon of Gomrath is a wonderful work of fantasy and mythology. It is a children's book, but like all of the best literature, can be read at any age. It comments quite profoundly on the human condition, and our longing for, yet distance from, spiritual beings."},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"I just completed reading the entertaining, but still oddly lacking \\"Moon of Gomrath\\". It was when I had almost completed the book when one of the central 10 or so characters dies that I realized what was missing - any emotional investment in the characters. The book would probably have gripped my 12-year-old self far more than it did the million-year-old me. Pity, because it began with a roar. Still, I can't wait to read \\"Boneland\\" ... when I can find a library copy, that is!"},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"I first read this book years ago when i was 13, I loved it then. I got the book for my son. I have just re-read the book and it is just as exciting and magical as the first time i read the it so many years ago!!"},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"I first read this in, I think, 1970. It remains a wonderful blend: ancient mythologies, the thrusting of a magical world into ours, and an intense consciousness of the spirit of place, the power of landscape. I've lived in Cheshire, though not where Garner lives, and while I really was conscious of just the mundane world of roads and towns, I can see how one could find it deeply satisfying to immerse oneself in its rich history.I like his skill in weaving in strands from other myths. Scotland lent him the Water Horse, the \\"Each Uisge.\\" Young Susan did not know that story, or she would have been suspicious of the friendly black pony that kept nuzzling her until she felt it wanted her to ride it, and she mounted...and the pony took off at full gallop towards the deep, deep, water-filled quarry...\\"No! Stop!\\" The pony turned its head and looked at Susan. Its foaming lips curled back in a grin, and the velvet was gone from the eye: in the heart of the black pupil was a red flame. NO!\\" Susan screamed.You'll have to read it to know what happened...Colin and Susan had seen the creature, the Brollachan, before without knowing what it was:\\"The hollows of the valley were in darkness, and a patch of the darkness was moving, darker than the rest. It flowed across the grass, shapeless, flat, changing in size, and up the cliff face. Somewhere near the middle, if there was a middle, were two red points of light. It slipped over the edge of the quarry, and was absorbed into the bracken.\\"Then we have the Wild Hunt with Herne the Hunter (though not named as such) the golden Lady of the Lake, the magical bracelet, dwarves, elves, the evil Morrigan...and all happening around the old farmhouse with its oil lamps and stables and goodman Mossock and his wife Bess. When they go to town: \\"Among all the parked cars, the Mossocks' green cart, with their white horse, Prince, between the shafts, stood thirty years behind its surroundings.\\" I think Alan Garner would have liked to have been born thirty years earlier, or maybe more, such is the sympathy for rural life that comes through his writing.As the old clich&eacute; goes, \\"for children of all ages\\" (well, let's say 9 and up...and up...and up...)"},{"Title":"The Moon of Gomrath: A Tale of Alderley","review":"The moon of gomrath was very boring to read and made us fall asleep.

There are two major drawbacks in my opinion -- first, as I said, the book is out of date since the many years of warfare in the region have had a profound effects on the peoples in this region. Second, the author devotes only one chapter to the numerous hill tribes. The book is geared toward state-level societies in the lowlands. At any rate, the reader will come away with a good general understanding of state-level societies in mainland Southeast Asia. It's a good starting point for further study."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"At the start of the Israeli conflict there were about 800.000 Palestinians and 200.000 Jews in the Paletine Mandate. This number of people, the size of a medium town have kept the headlines for the last 60 years and has had a tremendous impact on world politics, most of the time through problems of terror to each other and innocent bystanders. The events of the 11th of September are only the last installment in this tragedy.In order to understand just a little bit of this conflict it is absolutely necessary to have some background on the political history of the region.Prof. Cunningham does the job more than 100%. In a dispassionate, objective and always well-researched and very clear prose het takes us from the start of Islam through the Ottoman empire to today.By showing the roots from Islam he describes a territory which for very long was not defined by our concept of Nation-State, but much more a loose federation based on a common belief. In particular during the Ottoman empire it appeared in it's true form; a tolerant society respecting the various forms of Islam and, indeed, taking Islam as the main religion but tolerant of other religions as well.He also demonstrates quite clearly the devastating effects colonization has had in this region. By introducing the Realpolitik of that time where countries like Egypt and Syria only were regarded as supply centers for commodities or easy transport ( Suez Channel),the social fabric was destroyed and, more important, the right of self-determination was denied.Whilst in other parts of the world this may have helped to develop the countries, like e.g.India, in the Middle East it has led only to disaster. In particular the way Syria, Lebanon and Palestina were dealt with in the Sykes-Picot Agreement is beyond belief. The only two interests that were served were the French and the English. A similar pattern is seen in regions like Iraq and Iran.The resentment against the West is deep and goes a long way back. And, to be sure, at leats for me I have compassion for this resentment. The people of the Middle East have served for a long time only as pawns on the international chessboard.This in my view is the greatest value of Prof. Cunninghams book. He really takes us back to the many crossroads situation in the history of all these countries in the Middle East, demonstrates what choices there were and which have been chosen. Seldom this choice was the choice of the underdog in the game, the people themselves.We therefore understand after reading the book that the people in the region believe that there are many flaws in our Western system and that they want to guard themselves against these by emphasizing their own, Islamic, values. Inevitably this leads to fundamentalism and extremism.In particular, prof Cunningham shows the great despair of the Palestinian people. Driven from their home territory they have not a lot left to do. As a Westerner I had always feelings of sympathy for Israel and that remains. However, reading this book has made me see the Palestinian Plight in a much more reflective way and gave me understanding and sympathy for their situation as well.Finally, a compliment for the writing; cristal clear and never boring."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"If one is looking for an introduction to the region, this is probably the best book around. Its a shame other ridiculous authors get more publicity and exposure and inevitabley are chosen instead of this great survey. Don't make the same mistake, the man has knowledge, and he's a Canadian Professor."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"I don't think 600 pages is too long to cover the intricate details of more than a dozen countries. Granted, while Cleveland begins a few centuries before what most would call the 'modern' era, the foundational summary is important.The Middle East is like Africa in that its borders were politically engineered by European realpolitik. Any study of the Middle East would not be sufficient if it merely looked at each country individually. While the modern frontiers did not appear in the Middle East until after WWII and then were further re-arranged as late as WWII the borders are only half the story; tribalism, sheikhdoms, falling empires and entangling alliances are the other half.Cleveland is not as harsh as most others concerning the colonial masters and their strategies. The British mandates, specifically Iraq's, are described as cordial arrangements with steady agreement on withdrawal. Cleveland breaks the chapter sections into the revolutionary eras by colonial master. This method of organization tacitly suggests that French zones developed in roughly similar manners and British mandates shared similar fates.In reality, as Cleveland reveals in good detail, the middle east is a story of different levels of personal, tribal, city, state and ideological alliances. The first alliance was all against the colonial power. Upon independence each state was divided in loyalty by Hashemite ties, religious sect ties or the growing influence of Arab nationalism. The middle east collaborated the best when they fought against mutual threats. But even here, as Cleveland unfolds the plight of the Palestinians, no steady alliance would ever sacrifice national interest for the Palestinian cause.Cleveland has a very keen way of maintaining the uniqueness of each state as it progressed and still highlighting the interconnected realities of the region. The details could be overwhelming but if this is not your first book on the middle east the details will be enlightening and a worthy refresher."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"Cleveland's history of the Middle East is a superb summary of events that span the time between the formations of the Ottoman Empire and the Gulf War while weaving in the influence of Islam and the challenges of capitalism and imperialism. Cleveland brings his skill as a writer and analysis to bear on explaining the historical basis for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, and a dozen other conflicts in this volatile region.Cleveland's presentation of Middle East history is a 5-star work of art and analysis."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"This book is a very, very detailed overview of the Middle Eastern Europe. It starts of with the first converts of Islam in the first few centuries A.D. but it's main focus is on the more recent history, from the late Middle Ages until now. This way the reader gets a very broad view of the coming of Islam, it's place in the old times and the Ottoman empire and after. It even deals with 9/11 and after, and the spread of Islam around the world.For me, this work is like a typical history book. It's thick, it isn't hard to read but sometimes a little too detailed. Let's say this is really meant for people who want to understand the dynamics in the Middle East, especially it's political side, not for the reader who wants to be entertained.As for the validity of the authors arguments, I think those are very convincing. He wants to make the reader aware of the biased topics, gives a well informed opinion on it and let's the reader come to a conclusion."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"The book was anxiously awaited and delivered even BEFORE the projected date!

I would still like the book, however my patience is growing extremely thin!("},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"The beauty of this book lies in Cleveland's ability to link the events of each country in the Middle East's to one another. The book does not break each country into its own exclusive section like an elementary text book for simpletons, but rather into different eras and side by side with its neighboring states to demonstrate how revolutions, ideological shifts, economic policies, foreign alliances, etc. impacted one another. Another strength is Cleveland's willingness to show the West's often [bad] role in and the destruction the wake their imperialism left. It essentially gives you everything you need to know to have legitimate convictions on the current state of the ME."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"I read this book my freshman year at NYU and my perspective on the Middle East hasn't been the same since. This book is exquisitely written and although it is pretty short for what it covers, it is remarkably thorough. Additionally, I found the author's usage of irony and sarcasm as very funny and appropriate, and I remember laughing at the Ottoman diplomat's remark regarding how many wives he had. Any history book that can make you laugh while reading it and teach you so much at the same time is definitely worth a read by anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"I can't write an in-depth review due to my English skills, but I would summarize this book as an eye opener. I became interested in the topic due to the increased mentions of the Middle East in the news and even casual conversations in the public. Often we rush to offer an opinion on the matter, sadly, before even asking ourselves \\"do we really know anything about the topic at hand?\\"Have you ever caught yourself asking \\"why are Iraqis so divided?\\", \\"How did Mecca become the destination of Muslim pilgrimage?\\", \\"How do small countries such as Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar get established and survive as separate entities with such large neighbors (don't forget, oil was not in commercial use until 1930s and really after 1940s)?\\", \\"Why each Muslim country even though portrayed being the same as the other is really unique (e.g. Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Turkey)\\". I could go on and on and this book answered ALL of my questions and it sure will answer yours. I was totally shocked at the material and finally believe I can understand and reason on what is happening today.Even more, in general, we repeat the mistakes of history, and this book has plenty of such examples that apply to the current events. Also, in my opinion, it contains one of the best portrayals how world powers balance each other in different regions. If you are scared of behind the scenes manipulations by major players such as USA, China, and Russia in the region, this is nothing new. France, Russia, and Britain were the masters of it long before the current three came around."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"Having had a minimum experience of the Middle East before reading this book, it not only cleared up inumerable points, it also discussed large sections of history that were completely unknown to me. The book is set up well, using concise introductions at the beginning of each chapter which give the reader a clear undertstanding of what Cleveland will be telling you about, he then goes on in a clear outlined fashion about his chosen topic. Truly an excellent book for those who would like somewhere to begin their studies in the Middle East."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"Listening or reading the news nowadays becomes increasingly difficult as we hear about unknown nations going through wars and events that we don't understand.

With Cleveland's comprehensive explanation, you will be able to hold an intelligent conversation about today's \\"New York Times'\\" international news section without sounding like an empty show-off! \\"I have no clue\\" will leave your vocabulary.NB: Consider getting the newer edition, though. Since there is a section on modern politics in this book, the newer version obviously has more valuable, updated information (if that's something you care about.)"},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"\\"A Histrory of the Modern Middle East\\" By John Cleveland publishedby Westview Press C. 1999 it is about 592 pages and is an outstanding book for general knowledge about the entire region including Iran. Real easy read but a lot of information. This should be for the type of person who really wants to learn about a very misunderstood culture, region of the world and faith. As with almost every book on the Middle East, It gives a nice introduction to Islam without deluging the reading with the minute details. It shifts very quickly to the 20th century but does give lip service to the Ottoman Empire especially the Janissary Corps (We get the modern Marching band from them). The author really shines in his discussion of the Arab Israeli conflict and the Palestinian Israeli conflict. All in all outstanding. The new edition has the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"I thought I would just read the various conclusions, because I thought the author had packed in more detail than I wanted to know, but the way the professor writes drew me into the book and I read the whole thing. Now relative to my knowlege of the Middle East before reading this book, I feel like a Middle East expert (at least for a day or two)."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"After reading this book I was left with a pretty vivid conception of Middle Eastern politics and society. The author does a good job connecting various events and figures together, which makes conceptualizing a holistic picture much easier than treating them as distinct.Organizationally, the book was easily navigable by region/chronology. This also contributed to the coherence of the text as I never felt the author was jumping around, but rather moving in a progression.I also enjoyed the simplicity of the author's language, it was concise and precise. At the same time, the author avoided dry writing, and never managed to lose my interest.The only thing I felt was missing from this text was the inclusion of more North African countries, which although may not be geographically the \\"Middle East\\" still has strong connections to Middle Eastern culture and politics"},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"This is one of the best overviews of the Middle East I have found. IT is distinguished in that it manages to keep to its topic of the Middle East instead of losing focus and revolving everything aruond the state of Israel. While it includes this in the history there is a lot more that has taken shape here and continues to take shape. All in all a very good overview."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"On the one hand, this book addresses a lot of important issues that are overlooked by other history books. However, it is a book that discusses issues in history, not events in history, which I don't think is ideal for an introduction or overview. There is very little context for the beginner to Middle-Eastern history, and very little is learned about the who-what-where-when, although you'll get plenty of \\"why.\\"I was dissapointed because I was mislead by the table of contents into thinking it was a book that talked about what happened, not just theory behind what happened. So, let this be a caution to you who are looking for actual history. You're better off reading the \\"area handbook series country studies\\" either about individual countries, or groups such as \\"persian gulf countries,\\" which have much actual event history."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"William Cleveland's \\"A History of the Modern Middle East\\" is without a doubt an essential book for anyone interested in or studying Middle East history.Cleveland presents the history of the region from the late Ottoman Empire through to the more recent struggles dominating the airwaves and - and this is the most important thing - explains what on earth is at stake. This is a particularly important thing in Middle East history, as some of the alliances and divisions between different groups are somewhat arcane to the beginner.Unlike many books covering the history of the region, Cleveland writes in an eminently readable manner. While some readers will be astonished at the lack of diacritics and the like, this serves the purpose of communicating his information much more clearly.His analysis and sense of history are spot-on. Whether writing about the defeat of the Ottoman Empire or the land-rights struggle between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Cleveland presents the facts clearly and with a wry sense of humour at times - particularly in his discussion of Iran's modernising drive.Cleveland also has an eye for the anecdote and the illuminating personality, which greatly improves his abilities as a writer. If there's one problem with a lot of contemporary Middle East scholarship, it's the reliance on the dry historical record at the expense of the character sketch.If there is one criticism which could be made of this work, it's that Cleveland sometimes expects a little more background knowledge from his readers than perhaps he should. Already having an interest in this field, I did not suffer too much from this expectation, although the absolute beginner might have some problems.That said, this is a book I can highly recommend for anyone keen to learn about the genesis of a region which - for better or worse - looks as though it will be in the news headlines for many years to come. After all, as Winston Churchill (a man who does not come up roses in the history of this region) once said, those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it. Arguably, this is more true in the Middle East than anywhere else on earth."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"The first thing that might come to a student's mind with a history textbook would be the words: tedious, dull and unexciting. And do not worry because Cleveland possesses none of these negative qualities. Cleveland covers every topic on the modern Middle East to Oslo agreements and Muhammad Ali in Egypt. The book explains the history of a foreign culture and region that many people do not understand and he writes it in an easy to read format. I promise that it will not be the most exciting book in the world to read, but it will offer you knowledge on the Middle East that only a few actually understand and know. I am a history major at Indiana State University and took a course on modern Middle Eastern history taught by Robert Hunter that wrote \\"The Palestinian Uprising: A War by Other Means.\\"I considered Cleveland's textbook on the Modern Middle East a great source of history. After reading this book, I guarantee that you will better understand the present-day crisis in the Middle East than over ninety-five percent of the people in the United States."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"The Middle East is such a multi-faced region with such a rich historical legacy that even people who strive to be well-informed cannot help but feel bewildered at its cultural, political, and religious complexity. Given the blustering aggressiveness of the post-September 11 U.S. policy toward the region, however, Americans owe it to themselves to become far more familiar with the complexities of the Middle East than has been our wont up to now.Popular magazine articles that attempt to &quot;explain&quot; Islamic rage as the result of a &quot;fear of modernity&quot; or &quot;jealousy of the west's freedoms&quot; may as well bear a stamp proclaiming their authorship by the &quot;Ministry of Propaganda.&quot; As an alternative, I recommend Professor Cleveland's textbook, which serves as a brief but remarkably thorough introduction to the history of this volatile part of the world.No, the book does not cover Afghanistan or Pakistan, but clearly political currents in these nations are closely linked with what has transpired in Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and the rest of the Middle East proper. At the heart of the current crisis is, of course, the Israeli-Palestinian condundrum, and here the author's explanations and analyses are clear, balanced, and incisive. His discussions of the evolution of Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the background *and consequences* of the 1991 Gulf War are also invaluable. In his recounting of the Iranian revolution, Cleveland offers a fascinating analysis of the apparent Islamicist rejection of &quot;modernity,&quot; showing that those in the Middle East who reject the West do not crave a return to the ancient past, but instead wish to follow a modernization pathway that is guided by indigenous cultural principles, including the precepts of Islam.Perhaps most impressive, however, is what Cleveland has to say toward the end of the book regarding the dangers of an overly intrusive and domineering presence in the Islamic Middle East by the lone remaining planetary superpower, the U.S. He does not prophesy the recent terrorism that has afflicted this country, but he does criticize the U.S. for policies that seem to rely more upon aerial bombardment than careful diplomacy. The application of Cleveland's conclusions to a reevaluation of the likely long-term consequences of &quot;America's new war&quot; is not a comforting process, but it's one that perhaps more Americans need to undertake."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"Asside from being one of the most interesting and capturing professors at Simon Fraser University, Cleveland is an outstanding author! His book travels through modern Middle Eastern affairs in an unbias manner which is especially appealing for people new to the study of middle eastern history. His chapters use many subtitles which helps the reader along, and keeps them interested in the chapters events. Pictures and Maps give help to people who like view certain events they are reading about. This book is simply an easy one to read, and FINISH! I definitly recomend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the Middle East."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"It is with some reluctance that I offer this review. It is meant only as constructive criticism of a book written by an extremely knowledgeable author. I think this book would be great as a textbook for a formal class or for someone already somewhat familiar with the history and geography of the region. However, I started with neither. I only had only the desire to learn the background of a region that figures prominently in today's events. For me, the book delved into too much detail, the author describing all the intricacies of each transition of influence and power. There was more detail than I could comprehend outside of a classroom environment.If I could put the rest of my life on hold and go into study mode, perhaps I could absorb more. In my opinion, this is one of those books where the author is so intimately familiar with the material that he forgets just how ignorant the reader may be. I also thought the book contained far too few maps. I finally purchased some additional maps but with all the boundary and name changes, maps are required much more frequently to illustrate what is occurring.I carried this book with me for a year trying to get through it. I had to force myself to read it and I never did complete it. I have now ordered another book that I hope will be easier reading.I did learn many things from the portion of the book I read and I have a vague Idea what happened from the beginning of Islam through the period prior to World War 1. However, that is where I finally gave up.I am not saying this is a bad book. In the right hands, I think it would be a wonderful book. That said, I believe the book is not for people looking for background that cannot study it as a textbook. The target audience of this book may not be people such as myself and I may have selected a totally inappropriate text.There are many aspects of the history of the Middle East that do not lend themselves to easy reading. However, some authors can make history live, for nothing is as interesting as history. No novel can spin a wilder tale than history itself. This book just did not make history live for me. I will save it and perhaps one day when I have more background, I will read it again."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"I have lived in the Middle East for several years. This book is by far the BEST I have ever read at explaining &quot;why&quot; to many of the problems that we face today. It is not a cheerful book to read, in fact it almost makes one ashamed. It definitely made me ask &quot;why is it that so very few people in the United States have NO clue as to the history in this part of the world?&quot; This is a book that should be read by politicans and those in the news media. It is incredible that with all the news coverage since 9/11 that there has been so little attempt to learn, understand, and accept responsibility for the shameful and self-serving roles that Britian, France, and the United States have historically played and continue to play in molding this part of the world to fit the needs of the west. This book should be required reading for President Bush and his staff. At the same time I wish those at CNN, FOX, and the other news organizations would read the book as well. How can we call ourselves a &quot;free country&quot; when we don't take responsibility or are even taught about our role and motives in the history of this part of the world? We ARE a great country, but I am appalled that so many Americans (my friends and family included) could be in favor of a war without even the slightest understanding of OUR role in creating much of the current mess. I will &quot;require&quot; this book as reading for any of my friends and family who want to discuss the issues of this part of the world. It's a shame that I can't require it to those in the news media and government. The lack of historical understanding by the American population is truly frightening. If you can only read one book about the Middle East, this is the book to read. If you can read two, then read Thomas Friedman's &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot; as well. It is very rare to find balanced/honest accounts of Middle East history. Why?"},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"For those who want basic knowledge about the Middle East from the Ottoman Empire til today, there is no better source that than William Cleveland's A HISTORY OF THE MODERN MIDDLE EAST 3rd Ed. The book is readable and well organized. The subdivisions of chapters along with their titles facilitate the readers understanding of the topics. At first glance a work of over 500 pages looks extremely challenging however, I actually got to points where I could not put the book down.If there is one thesis that runs through the book I would say it is found in the final conclusion. It is that we fail to understand the legacy spawned by the disemberment of the Ottoman Empire early in the 20th century. \\"The end of the Ottoman order created new Arab states separated by new borders drawn by British and French officials to serve European imperial interest.\\" Coupled with the desire of Eurpe and America to maintain its supply of oil and the creation of the State of Isreal, there exist a formula for disorder and confusion that will probably never be settled.Cleveland fairly gives both sides of the extremely controversial picture that pits two religions - Islam and Judism - against each other. He shows how both religions are also greater than the concept of religion held by most Americans. In both cases, religion is also a part of the government and law.There are not answers in the book, but for the thinking person who wants to understand the Middle East, Cleveland goes a long way in terms of helping each person come to their own conclusions."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"This was a book I had to read for an introductory history of the middle east class and it is excellent. With all the bias floating around esp. now, this book provides an objective history of the region. I made the mistake of selling it back (was broke college student) and I regret it. But I am buying it again just to have it for reference which should give you some insight to what a great book it is."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"Dr. Cleveland is an amazing professor of history, and the guy can write! For an introductory history course I was not expecting great things, and having been inundated with dry histories this was refreshing. I like both the organization which effectivly show patterns and connections in the events dealt with. This is a huge body of information and the presentation does justice to both the events and their contexts.The most refreshing part of the work is that it takes a non-ethnocentric view and antagonizes no one with the stereotyping prevailent in works about this region."},{"Title":"A History of the Modern Middle East","review":"As a student of Middle East studies, I highly recommend this book as a good introduction to the dynamics of Middle East history. It not only provides a solid & comprehensive survey of Middle Eastern history, it also explains in sufficient detail the currents of ideologies and prominent social factors that contribute to the historical social and political patterns of the region. Also includes a good bibliography for further study. It is also notworthy to mention the relatively objective approach Cleveland takes to most historical events of the Middle East. Overall, it is a very good book that may be useful for all people interested in studying this region - I know I've used it to reference things numerous times."},{"Title":"Random reminiscences of men and events,","review":"I believe this is very important, interesting reading about a man very misunderstood.

The commitment to full employment legislated in 1946 has been \\"honored\\" in these socially destructive years ... by redefining \\"full\\" employment as a higher level of unemployment.\\"(p.6)The solution of the authors is government intervention in the economy and a re-evaluation of the public sector, although they recognize that Keynesianism was and is not perfect: it was unable to present a coherent theory of inflation; it failed to include a concept of stagflation; and its treatment of the money supply could lead to inflation.But in fact, the US government intervenes already heavily in the economy, but for the authors not in the right sector: defence.This book, written in 1995, contains already the central proposition of 'The Silent Takeover' by Noreena Hertz: \\"On a wold wide scale, this internationalization of finance seriously limits the ability of advanced nations to carry out domestic fiscal and monetary policies that are not compatible with the \\"will\\" of a stateless world financial market.\\" (p.120)Their world vision was correct, but too timid: \\"On a still lager front, world population growth threatens to bring another billion people into existence within a generation, raising the spectre of large immigration pressures for the advanced world ... Ecological problems ... the forces of ethnic and nationalist unrest ... together with sporadic terrorism.\\" (p.120-121)It is evident that the above mentioned problems can only be resolved by political intervention. The proceeds of the successes of the market economy can only be redistributed or guided by political decisions, by politicians, not by, but with the help of, economists. The problem is that no international authority has enough power to impose his decisions unilaterally on national states.Ultimately, the decisions lay in the hands of the voters. If a majority votes for a certain direction, the political authorities have to follow, otherwise they will loose their mandate.This is a thought provoking book."},{"Title":"The Crisis of Vision in Modern Economic Thought","review":"The two coauthors,Heilbroner and Milberg,understand,in very,very general terms,what Keynes's conclusion was in the General Theory(GT;1936)-due to the extreme difficulty of making optimal decisions about the size and quality of the capital stock to invest in and maintain in the face of irregular technological change over time under conditions of uncertainty(Daniel Ellsberg's ambiguity),capitalist societies will most likely have suboptimal amounts of private and public capital goods(plants,factories,infrastructure,etc.).This insufficient spending on long run investment projects leads to involuntary unemployment.This is as far as Heilbroner and Milberg can get.Due to their very limited mathematical capabilities,they completely overlook the formal technical analysis provided by Keynes in chapters 19,20,and 21 that proves his case.On p.262 in chapter 19 of the GT,Keynes specifies the major analytic conclusion of his theory-Unless the mpc(marginal propensity to consume)=1,involuntary unemployment will result.If the capital stock is at suboptimal levels,the condition then becomes mpc+mpi=1,where mpi is the marginal propensity to invest.This condition is the missing equation in Pigou's macroscopic model that Keynes discusses in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT.In both chapter 20 and chapter 21,Keynes derives the following optimality condition ,linking both the commodity market and the labor market-w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the marginal product of labor derived from an aggregated neoclassical production function(p.283,ft. 1 and 2).Unless mpc+mpi equal 1,it is impossible for labor,in the aggregate,to reduce unemployment by cutting the money wage.Involuntary unemployment will automatically exist.The reason why mpc+mpi will be &lt; 1 is due to the unstable,unpredictable,volatile nature of investment spending.This is ultimately due to the uncertainty or ambiguity of the information base faced by businessmen who are trying to figure out the correct amount of capital equipment to hold in the future in order to make an economic profit in the present by selling the output they have produced with that equipment in the past.Heilbroner and Milberg completely overlook Keynes's analysis although they understand the vision."},{"Title":"\\"The Supply for Tomorrow Must Not Fail\\": The Civil War of Captain Simon Perkins, Jr., a Union Quartermaster","review":"This is a tremendous addition to a little studied area of Civil War military science - supply and movement of the wherewithal.

In this 3rd edition, Professor Choo explores how CI fits into his vision of organizational learning. His focus is on what he labels as environmental scanning. For those of us in CI, it is a challenging study of the ways and the whys of how businesses find and use, as well as ignore, misuse or miss, vast amounts of raw data about their competitive and business environments.For those without a strong foundation in knowledge management, it may be slow going, but there are several conceptual as well as practical sections that are well worth the effort:In chapter 4 (\\"Environmental Scanning as Strategic Organizational Learning\\"), he quickly and lucidly explains how the competitive intelligence, business intelligence, and social intelligence relate to environmental scanning. In so doing, it is comforting to see that he has turned to the work of some of the key individuals who have provided the intellectual foundation for competitive intelligence, including Michael Porter (Competitive Strategy, 1980), Herbert E. Meyer (Real World Intelligence,1987), and Stevan Dedijer (Intelligence for Economic Development, 1987).In chapter 5, \\"Environment Scanning in Action\\", he collects and then dissects a number of studies, many hard to find, showing how businesses in 5 different countries conduct and utilize environmental scanning.Finally, \\"Learning to Be Intelligent\\" (Chapter 8) is, for us in CI, a new look at the issues we all face in developing and managing CI that will be used by management. Not only does Professor Choo draw on the experiences of CI practitioners, but he also provides a new look at how the principles we rely on fit into the context of an intelligent corporation.This is not a book for everyone. For those CI professionals who want to understand where CI can fit into the overall information processes of well-managed enterprises and how CI can be made more effective, it is a valuable resource.Review written by John McGonagle, Book editor of Competitive Intelligence Magazine.

Well, actually dreadful. First off, the text is filled with well over a thousand end of chapter exercises, most of which are ignored by prof and students. It's just simply overkill. Ten or fifteen are enough, no need for a hundred! Secondly, the text nearly brings on epileptic seizures with its cluttered and distracting pages-god help those with ADD. Each page is filled with so many boxes, notes, colors, numerous different fonts, and little irritating sidebar messages, the page/material is literally a swamp to move through, and difficult to review on the return journey. Such return journey's are expected with statistics, but they become a seriously increased burden when utilizing this MESS of a book. I've truly enjoyed my statistics course and plan to start the grad stats course track this fall. Unfortunately, I had to turn to healey(3rd) and devore(1st), for clarity and support. I stumbled on to moore and mccabe(4th) while reviewing harvard's/columbia's/new york university's syllabus's in a desperate search for alternate texts. It appears like it MIGHT be the best of all worlds as an intro text, though slightly mathematical. The clarity in writing coupled with some space on the page to breathe, think, and reflectively absorb (as well as simply locate, identify and read the formulas with ease) helped me to learn, and reduced my (somewhat controlled) math anxiety. I checked out freedman(3rd). It appears a little on the narrative side, still professionally technical and theoretical, but with some creamy chocolate goodness mixed in due to an amusing writing style. It appears smart, thoughtful, and charming. Sort of the Cary Grant of statistics texts. Style and substance. But I drift......If you see johnson and kuby's elementary statistics, RUN, RUN! to ANY OTHER text!"},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics","review":"Hey, I am not a math person...

Almost all of Cogswell's stories are lighthearted (besides \`The Burning'), replete with heavy doses of whimsy, and in the few readable stories, some vibrancy.Not my type of science fiction or fantasy.The title story is the only one worth reading.Brief Plot Summary/Analysis (*some spoilers*)\`The Masters' (1954) (8 pages) 2/5 (Bad): The last human on earth is a very hungry vampire. He thinks he's found a new victim when a very white/pretty woman appears a his castle. But in reality she's an android made out of enamel preparing the way (i.e. exterminating all life on Earth) for The Masters. Inverts the schema of the \\"pretty victims.\\" Instead the vampire is a victim.... Warning: I've realized that my description makes the story seem so much more interesting than it really is.\`The Specter General' (1952) (54 pages) 2/5 (Bad): A rambling muddle of a story which clocks in at an unfortunate 54 pages. A battalion of space marines, one of an seemingly infinite number of battalions, spends their time literally plowing furrows by hand. What keeps the \\"hope\\" alive in the endless \\"conflict\\" is the idea that the great leader of the rebellion which must be defeated is still alive, the ex-number two man. The implication is that if he is caught everything will go back to normal. The story actually does an adequate job indicating the futility of the mission. However, neither the story nor the characters were involving enough to pique my interest -- one of the few works I've given up on in the last few years of reading science fiction.\`Wolfie' (1954) (8 pages) 1/5 (Bad): Peter Vincent wants to commit murder so he consults Dr. Asoldi, a practicing warlock with a dusty office and pin-up girls photos... Dr. Asoldi gets all his secret technology and potions from a \\"non-human\\" entity. Vincent has a \\"foolproof\\" plan that involves turning into a werewolf in order to kill his cousin. Of course, the plan doesn't go according to plan and Vincent turns into a little dog with a wolf-like temperament.\`Emergency Rations' (1953) (5 pages) 2/5 (Bad): Probably the silliest story in the collection -- but, I did laugh, so I gave it an additional point. A hokey bunch of galactic invaders who practice cannibalism and want to conquer earth in order to eat the yummy human morsels come up with an \\"ingenious\\" plant to conquer an armed space station. They insert themselves into jars of lobsters, the rations of the space-station personel. Sneak in, kill the humans when the jars are opened. Instead, the space station chef pops the cans filled with the aliens into the boiling water, cooking their inhabitants. They dine on the would be invaders...\`The Burning' (1960) (5 pages) 2.75/5 (Average): The second best story in the collection -- unfortunately, it comes off as a rather pallid retelling of Shirley Jackson's famous short story The Lottery (1948). In a post-apocalyptical (I think) New York, a group of children decide to not go to the Mother's day celebration -- but, a celebration like no other. Take the narrator's statement literally: \\"I still felt jumpy. Not that I wanted to go, mind you, in spite of what the Mother was always saying about it in developing character. Mothers were always talking about Character and The Flag and The Sanctity of American Womenhood and stuff like that, but I notice it's always the little guys who end up getting burnt during Mother's Day ceremonies. And I'm a little guy.\\"\`Thimgs' (1958) (13 pages) 2.75/5 (Average): Albert Blotz is a disreputable \\"investigator\\" whose crime \\"solving\\" business collects money from the desperate and dispenses false hope to those in need. In short, no actual crimes are solved. Before his eyes his crippled office girl is transformed into a beautiful woman after she discovers a small bottle. Blotz stumbles upon a Guardian who oversees the tapes, i.e. the lives of all humans. The Guardian cut and spliced the girl's tape and thus inserted the object into her life that transformed her. Blot seeks to get the reward he thinks he deserves. A strange tale with potential... The third best in the collection.\`Test Area' (1955) (8 pages) 2/5 (Bad): Klen, the tentacled creator of a time machine, has his proposal to test his machine denied and starts to eat himself (his suicide is prevented, although he does comment that his backside tasted gamey). The Chief Coordinator gives into the suicide threat and the project is given a go. Standard miscalculations occur and bad things happen -- disasters, mutation, missiles, stuff like that.\`Prisoners of Love \`(1962) (14 pages) 2/5 (Bad): An office operating Halbert Shirley, a rather inept and frightened private warlock third class, is reluctant to get involved when people summon his services. When his secretary finally forces him to put on his magician attire and get respond to the calls of a woman who drew a pentagram in her house in an effort to summon Baal, Halbert is accidentally made pulled into exactly the sort of dilemma he so adamantly wanted to avoid. The idea of magicians operating out of offices, with secretaries, filing cabinets, phones etc is humorous but certainly doesn't sustain this silly fantasy number.\`Invasion Report' (1954) (14 pages) 2.5/5 (Average): In the far future technology allows virtually instantaneous transportation. A group of children transport to an abandoned derelict space craft and reenact epic space battles! And then a sensor goes off indicating another ship. In this case the twist ending is rather sweet + silly..\`The Wall Around the World' (1953) (26 pages) 3/5 (Average): In a world replete with weak forms of magic (lifting small objects, minor incantations) Porgie lives near The Wall -- a glass structures that goes around the entire world. He daydreams of ways to traverse the obstacle. His teacher encourages him but warns about evil forces at play if he attempts the feat. An interesting but flat allegorical tale -- and by far the best in the collection."},{"Title":"The wall around the world","review":"I really like \\"The Masters\\" but found it difficult to get into the others.

It is not only a history of the craft of knitting, it is also a reflection of the position of women in American society. No idle hands is scholarly and readable and deserves a place on knitters' bookshelves.I like this book well enough that I was thinking of buying the Kindle edition in addition to the hard copy I already have. That was until I saw the $19.99 price on the Kindle edition. Spend the extra penny and get a new hard copy -- it's a lot easier to flip from the index to text."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"Who knew that there is a \\"law of knitting?\\" I was delighted to learn of New England ordinances requiring all those who were able to knit to do so. Indeed, it appears that knitting, and thus self-sufficiency, were instrumental in our gaining independence from England. More than that, knitting can both fulfill one's requirements to be a virtuous worker and get in a little relaxation at the same time. This book is full of interesting facts that surely never occurred to me before, including the relationship between knitting and sound economies. (However, that theory is open to testing, as knitting boomed during the latest economic boom and seems to have fizzled a bit in these lean times.) I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys getting a bird's eye view into ordinary life as it was lived over the past few centuries. Truly a delightful book to read, reflecting much research and chasing down of detail."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"This book is a must read if you love to knit and you love history. Well written, full of fun filled stories, and facts. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"Reading the reviews, I can understand why a non-knitter would not be charmed by this book. This book is by, for and about knitters. Whenever I'm bogged down with my knitting, I pick this book up again, seeking inspiration from 200 years of American knitters. The book is delightfully written, with lots of original source quotations, and allows us to peek into the day-to-day lives of colonial knitters, revolutionary war knitters, civil war knitters, depression era knitters, etc. It gives one a strong sense of women's role in American society at different times, reminds us (often amusingly) about fads and trends, and shows how wars shape lives beyond the battlefields. It's a wonderful book. My only regret is that it doesn't have more photographs of knitters and old knit garments."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"This book describes the types of things that women (and sometimes men and children) knitted, the situations in which they learned, and how knitting contributed to their pleasure, financial survival, or feeling of political or social significance from the colonial period through the late 1980's, thus spanning the American Revolution, early nationhood, the westward movement and women's broadening education, both sides of the Civil War, both World Wars, and more recent generations. Setting knitting in the context of surrounding history, including such elements as wars, education, fashions, sports trends, and politics, _No Idle Hands_ would be valueable both to the ordinary knitter wanting a better idea of the past of his or her hobby and to a student of women's history. Although it contains no full patterns, it does have many excerpts from books, magazines, plays, diaries, and other writings that discussed knitting, and it has a bibliographty and index that together can help one trace sources for some of the patterns for items mentioned in the book; although some of these sources are obviously in historical societies and other out-of-the-way places, others are published sources that today's reader/knitter can buy."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"if you are a knitter. This book was a pleasure to read and really gave me a sense of being connected to generations and generations of women making warm things for the ones they loved. I was surprised to read about all the socks that were patriotically hand-knitted for soldiers during war years, right up through what we would consider to be more 'modern' times. Can you imagine the government asking women to knit socks for soldiers nowadays?! I now feel a compulsion to learn to knit socks - if the kids and old men could do it then, I can certainly learn to do it now!If you are a fan of 'real life' history - not about politics and empires, but about individuals and how they lived their lives - you will enjoy this book. And you will enjoy it even more if you knit."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"A non-knitter, I find this book a continuous pleasure. Macdonald's humor and serious interest knit well together. She looks at different aspects of women's work during peace and war. Men and boys who knit are discussed too, but the emphasis is on women knitting."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"This is probably one of the very best books I've read on any kind of needlework history.

In fact, there is currently a program to knit scarves in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Knitting for charity is also discussed.

So I have been living my fantasy buying all my dream books.About the book. Many references to people, places and things.I was fascinated by a knitted baby blanked called a Remsen Quilt originated with the World Church Services. To make a long story short I tracked down the woman they wrote about in a nursing home in Conn. and she wrote me a lovely letter.

Even so, it is a great \\"read\\" and leaves me with a sense of being connected with a long line of knitting sisters."},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"Gee, I loved this book. What I feared would be a dry-as-dust scholastic recitation of facts and history turned out to be just the opposite. Macdonald has combined fact, popular history, trivia, knitting and women's studies into one of the most interesting and entertaining history books I've ever read. Now in all fairness I'm a long time knitter, so while I find the pattern excerpts and yarn prices, etc, really entertaining, a non-knitter would probably not.From the very first chapter, it is clear that Macdonald has conducted meticulous research on her topic. How else would we know that Benjamin Franklin gave his sister a spinning wheel for a wedding present? Or that 700 women mended 80,000 Army socks in one month during World War 1? Or that Martha Washington had her own \\"personal\\" knitter on her Dower roster? Such detail puts the history into real terms and makes it readily accessible to the reader.The book is divided into 16 chapters, each one devoted to a decade or period starting with Colonial America and ending with the 80's. Almost every chapter contains pictures of women knitting, fashion photos and excerpts from publications and writings of the period. My favorite parts of the book were those places where she reprinted pattern instructions, which for many years contained no (or vague) gauge, yarn, or needle guidance. How awful! It's a wonder the Victorian ladies were ever able to knit anything even REMOTELY usable!So if you're a knitter interested in learning more about the continuum of American knitting, I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting","review":"I would have given this book two and a half stars if I could have. It's not bad, but it's of much more interest to knitters than anyone who is looking for social history. For one thing, it fairly often goes into details about knitting that a nonknitter or even a beginning knitter wouldn't get. For another, the author often seems more interested in quaint period detail than in history.For the most part, this book just enumerates what women knitted in each period of history. It gets repetitive, especially when it comes to the wartime knitting. The story is pretty much the same during each war: Women got together in societies and knit tons and tons of socks.She obviously did quite a bit of research, but doesn't draw many conclusions or put the information together in a compelling way. She piles on a lot of repetitive detail long after her point is made.I can see why some people thought this was a good read. Her writing style is conversational and informal, gossipy at times. But I found it tiresome. She likes to &quot;overuse&quot; &quot;quotes.&quot; She also writes almost entirely in loooonnnng sentences with a million clauses so that by the end of the sentence you forget what she was trying to say. Sometimes she even forgets to end the sentence.I'm looking forward to reading The Age of Homespun by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Her work also includes a lot of repetitive detail and tends to be dry, but she usually unearths some interesting facts and draws noteworthy conculsions."},{"Title":"The degradation of the democratic dogma (A Putnam Capricorn Book)","review":"First of all, the book is miserably printed. Especially the inner margins are essentially non-existent. I can't believe a better photocopy process is too expensive or not possible.Much of this is an introduction by Brooks Adams that is interesting mainly for what it reveals about Brooks. He's influenced by his brother's writings, but doesn't have the sharpness of mind that Henry had.The problem with Henry Adams's writings on making a science of history---the main topic of the essays published here---is his misunderstanding of the scientific process and his use of physical principles as if they were something more than just metaphors. He died too soon to have absorbed the operationalist influence of the Vienna philosophers. His arguments are empty because issues in history are not amenable to operational definition, so his whole project fails on this ground at least. He also interprets evolution as progress---a mistake a lot of people have made.Henry Adams is entertaining, as always, even when he's out of his depth scientifically. There's something of this pseudo-science in The Education, but it's only a bit of what he has to say; the rest is absolutely charming."},{"Title":"Zastrozzi;: A romance","review":"Zastrozzi: A Romance (1810) is a Gothic horror novel masterpiece by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

It was staged in Arkansas in the US this year. It has become a classic. In 1986, David Hopkins adapted the Shelley novel for a four-part mini-series for Britain TV.

Zastrozzi is a precursor of Rodion Raskolnikov of Crime and Punishment and Also Sprach Zarathustra. He is a superman who dismisses ordinary morality. He is an atheist for whom all is permitted. Zastrozzi is a demi-god, an assassin, who creates his own values and laws and morality.The novel is also about forgiveness. Matilda forgives and is able to find serenity. Zastrozzi is obsessed and consumed by revenge until it destroys both him and Matilda. The novel is about good and evil but ultimately transcends them.Zastrozzi is a tale of pure horror. Zastrozzi is not satiated to kill merely the body. He seeks to kill the soul. Death is not the worst that can happen. He keeps Verezzi alive to be able to inflict unspeakable tortures on him and to terrorize and to manipulate him. Zastrozzi seeks to punish not only the alleged wrongdoer, but to punish their progeny as well. Ironically, Verezzi and Zastrozzi may have had the same father. Verezzi is his brother. Zastrozzi seeks revenge against his own father, his human Creator. It is a revolt against God. Zastrozzi is angry with God and seeks to create his own reality, his own world. He becomes a god himself. The inquisition has no terrors for him. Death has no terror for him. He creates his own values and morality. He can do whatever he wishes with other human beings. He decides their fate, whether they will live or die. Zastrozzi reaches the limits of human horror and depravity and terror.Man rejects God and becomes a god himself. God is dead. This theme was later central to the Gothic novel Frankenstein by Shelley's wife Mary Shelley. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote the preface to that novel in 1818 published anonymously and according to John Lauritsen in The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein (2007), Percy Bysshe Shelley was the real author of Frankenstein. At the very least, Percy contributed major portions to that novel which shows his influence on every page.Percy Bysshe Shelley was a revolutionary visionary and firebrand who pushed the boundaries in literature and in his life. Zastrozzi reflects his artistic vision. The themes and central ideas of Zastrozzi are ones that would reappear. Zastrozzi is an unfairly overlooked and ignored Gothic horror masterpeice by one of the greatest Romantic writers.In 1977, Canadian playwright George F. Walker wrote a successful adaptation of the novel as a dramatic play. The play continues to be performed today. In 2007, Zastrozzi was staged in Arkansas in the US. In 1986, David Hopkins wrote an adaptation of the novel for British TV when a four-part mini-series was released by Channel Four Film.Zastrozzi is highly recommended.

So when I saw this short novel by Percy Shelley - her husband, but written before he had met her - I had to read it. I was also intrigued that the anti-hero of Percy's novel was named Matilda, a name Mary later used in one of her short novels ('Matilda', which may be autobiographical). For much of this novel I rated it at a 2 - but the ending did lift the rating. As far as prose is concerned I believe Mary was a far better writer than the youthful Percy.There is a puzzling relationship in this novel - that of the character whose name identifies this novel - Zastrozzi - and Matilda. But it concentrates on Matilda and her irrational passion for Verezzi - on and on it goes. Totally distracting me from the other issue. Shelley is entirely successful at this for me - obscuring the ending. But he was much less successful in sustaining the impetus of the novel, and keeping me interested.It is a novel worth reading, although I see no relationship between Percy's Matilda and Mary's - could Mary have possibly seen herself so negatively if her Matilda is indeed autobiographical? Perhaps it is so - although it doesn't read that way to me - Mary's 'Matilda', that is. 'Zastrozzi' is also quite short, so it's not really a labour to read.other recommendations:'Matilda' by Mary Shelley'Caleb Williams' by William Godwin (Mary's father)"},{"Title":"Engineering Design: A Systematic Approach","review":"This book is very good, especially at the soft cover price of about 50 dollars.

It contains the work which Kafka published in his lifetime, including 'Meditation' 'The Judgment' The Metamorphosis' ' The Country Doctor' ' In the Penal Colony' and three pieces of travel- writing.Had Brod obeyed his friend's instruction and burned his work, then this present collection would be what we have of Kafka. We would not have the Journals, the Letters to his Father, Milena, and others, the novels, The Castle, the Trial, most of Amerika.Nonetheless even from what there is in this volume alone we can see that we are dealing with one of world Literature's great originals. The uncanny and mysterious character of Kafka's writing, those strange riffs of reasoning which take us to places in imagination we have never been before pervade this volume.Two illustrations. First, the Bucket Rider a small story , a parable of the human soul in search of heat, and help meeting the cruelty of winter cold and the merciless human heart. The other, ' Metamorphosis' in which Kafkean self- contempt seems to find its most perfect embodiment, and in which we observe Gregor Samsa struggling to communicate with his family and the world to remain alive, only to be rejected in the end by those he loves and cares about.Camus said that Kafka is a writer that must be reread and reread if he is to be addressed properly. The element of parable in his writing is a major element in urging us to this rereading. In the famous 'Before the Law' and in the 'Imperial Messenger' we have two examples in which there is that improbable Kafkean combination of a special fate and chosenness combined with a cosmic impossibility and failure.I would have preferred to see introductions to each seperate piece here including details of the first publication of the work, and if possible of Kafka's considerations regarding each work. That is I would have preferred more extensive editorial work here.But this lapse cannot detract from the remarkable power of these stories. Rereading them after quite a few years away from them I am again struck by how wholly different Kafka seems from any other writer. I don't think that even Borges could teach him how to better write his Parable."},{"Title":"You Are Peter: An Orthodox Reflection on the Exercise of Papal Primacy","review":"Oliver Clement, the author of \\"The Roots of Christian Mysticism\\" has produced a small, yet fine work on the place of the papacy in reconciling the Christian division between Catholics, Orthodox, and to a lesser extent, Protestants.The first half of the book is more of a foundation with a quick lesson in history, mostly from an Orthodox perspective; however, the facts in these instances are undeniable by even unbiased historians. He writes about the different Popes, councils, and the relationship between the Western and Eastern states. He does not deny a papal primacy, but shows what that primacy meant in the early church.He then proceeds to inform the reader of the Gregorian era and its devastating effects on Christian untiy. The reformation is also mentioned and so is the first and second Vatican Councils. He shows that since the second council, there are encouraging signs toward reconciliation and that the papacy does play a role in this process.He ends with advice both to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox Church. He shows the potential pitfalls and upsides in the issue at hand. This is a nice small book, written for the laymen, clergy, and scholar alike."},{"Title":"You Are Peter: An Orthodox Reflection on the Exercise of Papal Primacy","review":"In this book, Oliver Clement shows how Catholic and Orthodox views regarding the papacy can be reconciled so that communion may be restored. Quotations from various Church Fathers of the first millenium regarding the papacy are often used by polemicists on both sides to argue that their opponents have deviated from the Apostolic faith. He shows how this seemingly conflicting patristic evidence can be reconciled by showing how the _behavior_ of the united first millenium church contextualizes and explains what the various Church Fathers were trying to say.As a Roman Catholic, I greatly appreciated how Clement shows a possible way in which the concept of infallible papal definitions can be understood and expressed so that it could also be acceptable to the Orthodox. Overall, the outline of a reunion proposal in Chapter 12 seems both reasonable and realistic (at least theologically).The historical content of the book is concise and informative. He shows the divergence between the Catholic and Orthodox positions on papal primacy to be a gradual process, even during the contentious second millenium. His description (in Chapter 9) of how \\"a certain amnesia in the Orthodox tradition\\" about the primacy of the Bishop of Rome developed was especially interesting. His line of argument that Popes Paul VI and John Paul II have done much of what Orthodox Christians of the early second millenium demanded of the papacy commands much reflection.It will be interesting to see if the corresponding hierarchies of the Catholic and Orthodox churches will ever be able to follow through on Clement's proposals. In any event, I highly recommend this book to all Catholic and Orthodox Christians who are interested in this topic. If more and more well-informed believers in both communions come to see reunion as desirable and possible, pray for reunion, and make this known to their priests and bishops, then the Holy Spirit may well work a miracle for us."},{"Title":"You Are Peter: An Orthodox Reflection on the Exercise of Papal Primacy","review":"One of France's leading Eastern Orthodox theologians, Cl&eacute;ment is no stranger to ecumenical dialogue. Like Bishop Kallistos Ware, his charitable style, combined with a personal humility, makes him one of the more likeable characters on the ecumenical scene in Western Europe.This work, aimed at bringing mutual understanding between the Orthodox and Romans, is something of a brief refresher on the subject, aiming to help all parties involved to move forward from confessional foxholes to a more realistic, historical and viable doctrine pf papal authority. Affirming the validity of papal authority in the ancient tradition, he avoids the common pitfall of turning Rome into just another bishopric that happened to be a capitol city. In his view, the Papacy did and should continue to play a role of authority on doctrinal matters as the locus of authority and union. At the same time, how that authority should be exercised must change to recognize the autonomy of local jurisdictions. It cannot be an authority of force. He calls for the papacy to reexamine its relatively recent teaching on universal and immediate jurisdiction, something that he believes neither theology nor history supports. At the same time, he argues that Orthodox need to chill out a bit on their own Romaphobia and accept the legitimate, properly exercised, role of the papacy.Other books of interest may include:The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church,Power and the Papacy: The People and Politics Behind the Doctrine of Infallibility,Being As Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church (Contemporary Greek Theologians Series , No 4),Eucharist, Bishop, Church: The Unity of the Church in the Divine Eucharist and the Bishop During the First Three CenturiesandAfter Nine Hundred Years: The Background of the Schism Between the Eastern and Western Churches"},{"Title":"You Are Peter: An Orthodox Reflection on the Exercise of Papal Primacy","review":"The concrete parts of the book (where the author reports historical events and quotes other people) are very helpful and very readable. However when the author launches into the abstracts (as he does in the first and last chapters) I had great difficulty trying to figure out what he was saying. It was as if someone else took over the writing and strung together a bunch English words in a way that made no sense. All in all an excellent book which gives hope for unification of the Church.

Who will NOT like it? Those who insist that stories should be told in a linear fashion. This novel jumps back and forth in time and space, sometimes within a paragraph. For those who prefer traditional story telling, you may not like this. I enjoyed this unique style because it made me pay attention, and after all, no one in real life tells long life stories in a linear fashion, it's natural to jump around.Also, those who dislike gays/homosexuals may not appreciate the novel. Although this novel is certainly not a &quot;gay novel,&quot; the protagonist is gay, and so it is hard to avoid the subject! Chapter 11 (in the middle of the novel) is graphic, so those who are sensitive to this, may want to skip the chapter and continue reading.However, in the end this novel is about creating a novel, the desire for immortality, and the works of literature that inspire writing.I've read many professional reviews of this book, and they are consistently positive.I can understand why some readers may not like the style. You never know if you are in or out of the novel. Sometimes you don't know if an event really happened. To some, this can be maddening. To most, however, it makes the novel thrilling and engaging.The novel is mostly true, but is in the fiction category, because there is some artistic license.I can't guarantee that you'll love it, although nearly everyone I know who has read it has love it.I recommend taking a small risk and buying it. I doubt you'll regret it, especially if you have any appreciation of literature and/or original writing styles.Philippe Tapon's next novel will be entitled &quot;The Mistress&quot; and it comes out in January 1999.

Then look no further, because &quot;A Parisian from Kansas&quot; is all you need to enjoy yourself and see some things in life with wide-open eyes. Ambitious to its purpose and true to its kind, this story unfolds the life of Darren Swenson, an American dealing with AIDS who despises his roots and believes that a book about his life will immortalize him forever. Darren's life and the making of this biography both intertwine between each other, building up a concept worthy of admiration. In a few words, a story inside a story.

I can't wait for his next novel"},{"Title":"A Parisian from Kansas","review":"As the author's brother, you might think that I'm favorably biased to his work. In reality, I read it even more critically than I would a &quot;regular&quot; book. Why? Because he asked me to critique the final draft.Despite my critical eye, I must say, objectively, that this is an incredible book. However, instead of reviewing it in a traditional way, I thought it would be helpful to give you my unique perspective into my brother's novel and tell you stories you wouldn't otherwise here about the making of the novel. Also, I will report what objective professional book reviewers have said about the book.BACKGROUNDOver a year ago, my brother sent three chapters of the book to a famous semi-retired editor, William Abrahams. After reading the 3 chapters, Mr. Abrahams asked for the rest of the book. Although he had vowed to never edit someone's first attempt at a book (and kept that vow for over 40 years), he decided to break it for Philippe's book. Moreover, he decided to come out of his semi-retired state to edit it. Obviously, this book must have been extremely compelling to make such a famous editor take such significant action.Mr. Abrahams did it, &quot;Because I've never read anything like this.&quot; In fact, that's what most people say after reading it, and I can almost guarantee that you will too. I cannot promise that you'll love it (though nearly everyone has), but I can promise you that you'll agree that it is extremely original and thought provoking.ANALYSISThroughout the work the author makes allusions to great works such as T.S. Elliott's &quot;Wasteland,&quot; Fitzgerald's &quot;Great Gatsby,&quot; and Irving's &quot;The World According To Garp.&quot; It is a self-referential novel that makes reading it exciting. Even though the work is considered fiction, about 80-90% of the novel events actually occurred; so one can certainly say that it is based on a true story.What makes the book so fascinating is that it is simple enough to read casually and enjoy on a superficial level, and yet it is complex enough to be analyzed in a graduate school level English literature class.For example, the novel has a distinct &quot;architecture&quot; that borrows from the immortal &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer. Like the Odyssey, &quot;A Parisian From Kansas&quot; has 24 chapters, and significant events occur at each multiple of 3 and 4. Even stronger events occur in chapters 6, 12, 18, and 24.For example, in Homer's masterpiece, Odysseus describes his voyage to &quot;hell&quot; in Chapter 9. By Chapter 11 he recounts the deepest depths of the underworld. By Chapter 12, Odysseus snaps out of his flashback.Similarly, Philippe writes what he calls the Fragment Chapters (numbers 9-11) in his novel. Starting in Chapter 9 the writing style changes DRAMATICALLY, as Darren, the protagonist, begins to narrate. Philippe transcribes the thoughts that Darren has recorded on a tape. Chapters 9 through 11 delve into Darren's life from his perspective. Because of the different style, these chapters truly feel like a &quot;departure&quot; from the book.And just as Odysseus delves into the horrors of Hades in Chapter 11 of the Odyssey, Darren graphically depicts the homosexual sexual acts he committed in his brash youth. The revolting description reaches a crescendo by the end of Chapter 11 and one breaths a sigh of relief as the author reverts to the novel's original style and story.If you are sensitive to such writings, I suggest you skip the Fragment Chapters (9-11), especially Chapter 11. However, although the descriptions are graphic, they are not gratuitous -- they stem from the deep architectural design of the novel.Moreover, don't worry that this novel is a bunch of intellectual mumbo-jumbo. While the novel is intense, it is not heavy. The writing style flows smoothly and is frequently light and colloquial.WHAT OBJECTIVE PROFESSIONAL REVIEWERS THINKThe publisher, Dutton, is putting an unusual effort in launching this novel. It is printing 20,000 copies (double the number of copies it normally does for first-time authors), and it wants the world see this book's release as a &quot;major literary event.&quot; Indeed, the publishers and editors truly believe that they have found a revolutionary author on par with Hemingway; they believe (as do I) that this novel is Literature, not just another trashy novel. And at same time it is not stuffy boring literature; it can be read and enjoyed by all.Two reviewers gave the novel a prestigious star (reserved for the best books). Moreover, Publishers Weekly has selected Philippe's novel as one of 15 most noteworthy first-time novelists in the United States.The author's editor told him after reading the book: &quot;Philippe, you are a better writer than John Irving, and you have nothing to envy from Fitzgerald.&quot; Heavy compliments indeed coming from such a renowned editor who is over 72 years old, and has seen his share of writers.In conclusion, &quot;A Parisian From Kansas&quot; is truly an amazing work. To think that the author wrote it in just 9 months while working in Paris part-time is flabbergasting. I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Philippe is simply a writing genius.I GIVE THIS NOVEL MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION."},{"Title":"A Parisian from Kansas","review":"This novel is refreshingly different from the standard fare. Its non-linear storytelling is enormouslyrealistic, because persons rarely recount their experiences in a chronological fashion. The novel skipsback and forth in time, but never in a way that is confusing or difficult to follow. Its self-referentialstyle is also refreshing as you witness the creation of the novel, including: criticisms by theprotagonists about the work; internal struggles of the author as he crafts the novel; and even praisesand critiques from the press after the novel is published! It is these unique twists and original storytelling that make the novel so entertaining and real. Although not everyone will appreciate such astyle, I believe most will.

In three sections, SOMEHOW manages \\"somehow\\" to replicate a whole world of existence, from birth through death, often by concentrating on the little things, the quieter moments that are often ignored in contemporary poetry. The \\"haiku\\" form which he takes up in one poem might be said to explore this tendency in a spectacularly compressed way, but there are no such fireworks in Kimmelman's writing, which is all to the good.He includes a few ekphrastic poems here (poems written to works of art or to pieces of music), which ordinarily I don't care for, but these two, on Richter and Sol LeWitt, are pretty fine. They don't hit you over the head saying, \\"I am to poetry what Gerhard Richter is to painting\\" or anything of that sort. People say that sometimes you can \\"read\\" a poet's work by noting first the names of those to whom he (or she) mines for epigraphs, ad I've never been so convinced of the verity of this generalization as in this specific instance. Kimmelman's epigraphs tell us who are his masters (say, Zukofsky, Chaucer, Gary Snyder) and include some lesser lights to make him more human (Michael Heller, Ronald Johnson, William Bronk). Or maybe he is telling us that Johnson and Bronk are the equals of Zukofsky--many poets are coming around to that point of view--but in that case I'm not going there with him.What is astonishing is the middle section, in which he writes poems about a daughter, Jane, from her birth to age 11, in different poetic styles, but always seeming to catch the exact delicate moment of youth and to tabulate its changes from year to year with the feathery hand of grace. And the final section breaks your heart with its simplicity and its weathered gravitas. I wish I had space to quote the whole thing, but it's twelve poems, \\"Late January,\\" \\"Late February,\\" and so forth, poems quite brief, nearly negligible, but taken in succession, we feel while reading this sequence some Arnoldian sadness as though yes, we are very late in this spell of late capitalism and even nature feels as though time were running out. Here is a mood and mode entirely bypassed by Zukofsky, who otherwise seems to have already mastered, like Shakespeare, so many other and subsequent poetic ideas and tropes. In SOMEHOW everything comes together so beautifully you will just feel sad it's ended instead of with a breath of relief as in other, overextended books of US and Continental poetry."},{"Title":"Somehow","review":"Each book of poetry Kimmelman creates is different and varies in style and focus but, always, he provides readers with quiet places of contemplation and clarity. He weaves precise syllables and forms into \\"two dimensional / worlds without memory, lives lived / at odd angles...\\" His words, these quiet places he inhabits, become a celebration of life and the natural world around us.In \\"Standing Stones\\" he memorializes a place most readers will never see, Calanais, the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. In this place, humans can rejoice and weep:The unworked stones standingtall before the living,found or quarried, raw andyet so intelligentin their perfect array --how long since they were set --oddly, they ignore theaspiration towards grace,the unforgiving cragsrough to the touch, havingmade a space where time, amist, can come among us,and then leave us in tears.\\"Gerhard Richter's Stag\\" draws readers into this celebrated painting in the Museum of Modern Art through ekphrasia and the poet's eye:The blurred antlers,obscure eye, tautmusculature --the flat lines offorest before,after -- half inthe hunter's sight,lost in a worldwithout shadow.\\"Letter To My Dead Brother\\" needs no commentary to enhance or explain its simple power. I quote the first verse in example:I suppose letters to the dead are common.We need to speak, even when no one's there.I think of the crazy juxtapositions, the peopleand things you loved. Life is a mute grieving.Sometimes, the opinions of scholars and pundits seem unnecessary. Sometimes, a poet's work speaks eloquently for itself and needs no explanation. Burt Kimmelman is such a poet."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"This is a very nice easy read for young pre-teens. I read the book just because I wanted a nice light easy read. I found myself laughing at the girls in the book as I remembered acting sometimes like them.Rachel Robinson is a 13 year old girl who is highly intelligent and loves to learn. She is the youngest of the children in her family. She has an older brother who she finds annoying. I am sure many sisters would agree that their brother would be annoying too.Rachel has two friends who she shares almost everything with.

She comes from a family where overachieving is valued, and her mother, an important trial lawyer, is the ultimate in overachieving. Rachel's sister Jess isn't perfect, but she gets along well with Rachel and is surviving high school despite her bad acne. The only problem in the family is Rachel's brother, Charles. He has been in boarding school, but proved to be such a discipline problem they expelled him. Now Rachel's peace and quiet is shattered when her brother comes home and looks for ways to torment her and the rest of her family.Family dinners are no longer tranquil; Charles manages to ruin them by saying nasty things to the rest of his family members. He harasses his sisters and is downright rude to his parents. Rachel can't stand him, but she doesn't know what to do to get him to stop the way he is behaving. Her parents are at a loss, too.To make matters even worse, Rachel's two best friends seem to be getting even closer together, and Rachel worries that her constant state of stress might be pushing them away. Will Rachel be able to survive the pressures of this year without snapping?I liked the family relationships highlighted in this story. I liked the way Rachel and her sister interacted and the way Rachel and her parents interacted. It was interesting to see how her family fit together without Charles and how they fit together with him. I also liked Rachel's cousin and the different perspective she gave on Rachel's life.I didn't like that this book didn't really have any conclusion. Did things get better? What happened after the Ellis Island incident? What was going on with Steph and Alison? I felt like the book should have covered a couple more months, and that would have given me time to get to know Charles a little bit better."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"Here's to you Rachel Robinson is a book that many people could connect to.This book is a very good book because she is any other person like us hope you read it soon.I was given this book by my homeroom teacher Ms.Levinson.She recomended this book to me.

He was sent away to boarding school, but was kicked out, because he never turned any work in. I really enjoyed this book, because it showed what it would be like to have a VERY annoying brother, who is always making you angry. This book also showed what it's liek to be a \\"normal\\" teenager today, becasue it tells about her crushes, school problems, adn her friendships.

A little bit about Charles had changed at the end of the book and I think that he only changed because of the good attitude that rubbed off of his family members and onto him.This book was definitely a page turner because in every sentence there was something interesting and cool. The character that I mostly relate to is Stephanie. The reasons why are because she loves having fun and is very out there with her feeling because she expresses her feelings clear and isn't afraid about what people think of her.

But the older Rachel gets, the more she's forced to realize that life doesn't always go as planned, no matter how hard you try. There are fights with friends, her sister Jessica's battle with cystic acne, and her brother Charles' surly, argumentative way of destroying her family's harmony.Yet despite all the problems, Rachel begins to see there's a lot that CAN be done -- even if she can't play savior. She can truly listen to her friends, as well as honestly get to know Charles for the first time in their lives, and try to understand more about where they're coming from before passing judgment.Although this book is the sequel to \\"Just as Long as We're Together,\\" it CAN easily be read as a stand-alone work."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"I've been a Judy Blume fan for quite a while, and after read the first book in the Rachel, Allison and Stephanie trioligy, I just had to read the 2nd.

The setting of the story was in Vermount when Rachel was around the age of fourteen. The main characters in the story were Rachel,Jessica,Robby, Nell,Victor, and Charles. My favorite character is Rachel beacause when she's stressed she listens to music or plays her instrument to make her feel relaxed or calm ,and I also like to listen to music.

Even though she is only in seventh grade, she will be going to college for extra classes and is a role model to all students. She is the student, teachers recommend for special activities and never gets into trouble. Anything under an A is unheard of for her high standards.Her life is not as perfect as it may seem though. Her older brother, Charles, just got kicked our of another school without passing the ninth grade for the third time. He is now home permanently, causing Rachel and her entire family to feel stressed. Charles is a troublemaker and Rachel definitely does not want him around.All of Rachel's friends think Charles is the brother they have to impress and just do not see how much of a pain he really is. Rachel has to practically drag them away from him. Charles' room is always filled with people drinking and just hanging out without their parents knowing anything about it. Charles' tutor is the only person he will actually listen to and can not survive in regular school. Listening to his parents' requests to stop teasing his sisters and to be civil around the family is unheard of.Having a fammily consisting of a wimp of a father, an ice-queen of a mother, a potato headed sister, and herself referred to as her mom's clone according to Charles is more than any of her family can bear with on a daily basis. (spoiler)I would recommend this b ook for younger students. The plot is rather boring with no excitement. It drags on about the same events, which are not very interesting in the first place. A younger reader may enjoy it because of the easy to follow plot. Each of the characters are very simple and ordinary. Overall, the book was just an easy reader with no challenge to it"},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"I am a fan of Judy's work, but I have to say this isn't the greatest book that is in print.Ms. Blume tells us the story of Rachel, in her own words. Rachel is a neat freak, to put it nicely, a straight-A student, and tries to help the school in any way possible. She though, tries a bit too hard to make everything right, as she finds out there's some new worries - her brother Charles is home for good, and Charles is not the nicest brother in the world.It's a must-read if you've read HERE'S TO YOU's companion book, JUST AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER, which tells the story of Stephanie, Rachel's best friend. But even reading this one will sometimes make you ready to doze off. It should be a good book, you might think, because you've read JUST AS LONG, but unfortunately HERE'S TO YOU isn't just as long: JUST AS LONG is around 208 pages, this is a mere 102 at the highest.

In Here's To You, we find out all about Rachel's troubles which include her hateful brother and her crush on his much older tutor, not to mention *yawn* Rachel's many extracirricular activities.

Her best friends, Alison and Stephanie were not understanding enough in this area as they did not know how being a top student was like. Facing all the problems thrown at her, and without the support of her buddies, Rachel had to fight alone. What's more, Rachel found herself in love with her brother's tutor.In this delighting sequel, you find yourselves back with the same crowd as in the first book.

It was a 9-12 year old book too! I was real surprised but it didn't stop me from reading the book. It was a really good book as a matter of fact. It's about a girl Rachael with 2 friends that she doesn't trust that much. She worries too much, is involved too much, and is afraid of getting a b+ on her homework. Then her brother is suspended again from this private school! Actually this time he was expelled! Her brother comes home and she's really disapointed! He walks over the family, makes them ALL cry, and all her friends flurt with him! Rachael can't take it anymore. Finally, she devolopes a crush on her brother's tutor, is worrying a lot about her brother finding out! Then Jermy Dragon, the cutest boy in the school kisses her 4 times! Plus she has to worry about her cousin, divorced with a baby, always coming to HER mom for help! (obstacles she calls them) Plus, now her cousin is going out with HER crush! It was also HER brother's tutor! Now she'll NEVER forgive her! Now her brother is making the scene! Judge mommy can't controll him! They all go to bed crying wishing he'd go!

While I enjoy all of Judy Blume's young adult books this one I have to say was way too short in my opinion. It does a excellent job of touching on the pains of being a preteen that we all remember so well. And it is done with both humility and hilarity at times.

The C stands for Charles.\\" You might be thinking, now who is this Charles and I would say to read exactly what is in the first sentence. The book, Here's to you Rachel Robinson is based upon a thirteen-year-old girl whose brother is nothing but trouble. It takes place during the year 2004, now, at school and at home. This book all started when Charles got sent to boarding school in Virginia. After that everything just went downhill for the Robinson's. Then Charles came home, Rachel, the main character, is already a worrywart. When Charles comes home she's an even bigger worrywart. So this whole story is about the life of Rachel and her older brother Charles and the ups and downs of their life. The genre of this book could be realistic fiction because it could happen in real life, but it is non fiction because it didn't really happen, it's just a made up.This book isn't what I'm used to reading for a free read book, but I liked it a lot. This book had humor and suspense, which is everything I like in a book. This book is great for 13-15 year old girls because it has many problems that girls face today (Boys, brothers, boyfriend's etc). Judy Blume, the author, made this book very enjoyable. Her style of writing I much like because she writes as if Rachel is standing right next to you telling her story. I felt like I connected to Rachel and my brother to Charles. The only difference is I'm older than my brother. We argue constantly and get each other mad usually on purpose.

It's about a girl who has trouble with her family, friends, and school. One reason why it's my favorite book is it shows that families aren't perfect. For example, Rachel's brother is always getting into trouble, and now he has to come home from boarding school because he got expelled. Another reason why it's my favorite book is that friendship is not always the best. For example, Rachel's best never tells her anything, she talks about her to all of her other friends, and is starting to yell at her about everything. The last reason why I like this book is it shows that you should always try hard in school and put it before activities. For example, Rachel has so many activities that if she doesn't keep up with her work, her grades might slip.

I liked this book because it solves a lot of family problems. This family has many problems but they all work together to solve their problems. One problem is that Charles, Rachel's brother, gets expelled from school. Charles does not stop annoying Rachel and Rachel's sister, Jessica. Another problem is that Rachel is expected to do more actives by her teachers. Rachel has many after school activities to choose from but she already has enough to do. There are many great things that happen in the story. One great thing is that Rachel's mom gets to be a judge. Another great thing that happens in the story is that Charles finds their family history. Rachel is someone who you would call a straight \\"A\\" student.

Rachel adores Paul."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"Jennifer Rodriguez 12/2/04\\"Here's To You, Rachel Robinson\\"Author: Judy BlumeISPN: 0-531-06801-3Being the youngest child in the Robinson family was anything but lucky. For Rachel Robinson, life has always been a rollercoaster as long as her older brother Charles was there. Life in the Robinson household has always been peaceful until Charles got expelled from boarding school. Now Rachel and her family have to put up with all his tantrums. At home nothing seems to help Rachel relax and forget about her problems with her brother. The only way she can feel calm is in school, but that doesn't get any better once her two best friends start liking Charles. The Robinson family has always tried to make Charles very welcomed when he comes back from school, but nothing to seems to work. Once a big fight breaks out with Charles and his family, he decides to change his last name from Robinson to Rybcznski to distance himself even more from his family. The Robinson family go through a lot of ups and downs in this book, which makes you want to keep reading this realistic fiction book.In my opinion, this was a great book. I would definitely recommend this book to pre-teen or teenage girls. In the book \\"Here's To You, Rachel Robinson\\" there are a lot of problems that girls can relate to. One of the most common problems I'm sure girls have experienced is having an older or little brother that embarrasses you in front of your crush. If you read this book, you would not want to put it down. Judy Blume's writing makes you really want to stick to the book and nothing else. On almost every chapter there was a cliff-hanger that would make you want to keep reading. If you liked the book \\"What my Mother Doesn't Know\\" by Sonya Sones you will definitely like this book. The problems in \\"Here's To You, Rachel Robinson\\" are similar to the ones that an average pre-teen or teenage girls face everyday. If you want a book that will keep you reading and that you can relate to, \\"Here's To You, Rachel Robinson\\" is the perfect book for you to read."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"Personally this is the best book I've ever read. The use of vocabulary and woringing is excellent! All girls and even boys ages 10-15 should read this funny yet serious book. I think everyone can relate somehow."},{"Title":"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson","review":"\\"Trouble in our family is spelled with a capital C and it has been as long as I can remember. The C stands for Charles.\\" Imagine that you had and older brother that you couldn't stand. Well, that is exactly how Rachel Robinson feels in the book Here's To You, Rachel Robinson. The two words that Rachel uses to describe her older brother are rude and obnoxious. The genre of this book is realistic fiction.Here's To You Rachel Robinson is about a girl named Rachel who has an obnoxious brother. His name is Charles. Charles has a bad relationship with his family, and it is getting worse. He has bad manners, he is rude, and he is a bad kid. Charles has been kicked out of many boarding schools, and now, he is coming home to live with his family. This book was pretty much a page-turner because it kept me interested in what Charles would do next. It kept you concentrating on the plot and how it would be solved. I think that it was a little hard to concentrate on because there were a lot of characters that you had to keep track of, but in the end, I understood what was going on. If I were to recommend this book, I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read realistic fiction, read about family crisis, and someone who LOVES TO READ!Well, I have told you a lot about the book Here's To You, Rachel Robinson, and I hope that you will go out and read the book. Also, if you love Judy Blume books, then you might be interested in other books that she has written. Iggie's House, Blubber, and Are you there God? It's Me, Margaret are just a few of her titles.

But like the scorpion in the fable;he just can't help being who he is! Malamud seemed to move into this area of exploration with more contemporary characters in his latter books-this is broadly similar to 'Dubins Lives'-where are lives are influenced by our natures and the moment in history we exist in,yet we continually try to satisfy the falsehoods of society,or other peoples expectations.This is a good,satisfying read.Malamuds prose of even mundane surroundings leave a vivid picture in your mind,and there are great pieces of humour: (\\"We're going to do it on the desk?\\" \\"I hated to mention the floor,but where else is there!\\")I love Malamuds work for many reasons.Yes this is a lot 'softer' than 'The Fixer' or the life of poor old Fiedelman,but it gives another insight to Malamuds take on life.He's also a member of the 'Holy Trinity' of great 20th century Jewish writers;sitting alongside Beshevis Singer and Saul Bellow, in my view."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"Rereading this book after many years was at first a great pleasure. How wonderful to go into the innocent world of a small- town university in the 1950's. The protagonist Levin is a New Yorker who goes West to Cascadia College to find a new world and life. He comes to what he thought would be a liberal- arts college and is in fact a kind of community -vocational college. Nonetheless he wonders at the remarkable outdoor world, and also at a whole group of faculty- characters he meets.So far, so good. But innocent Levin turns out to be a less than admirable character, and the second part of the book centers on his love- affair with the wife of the faculty member who has greeted him and been most kind to him.This affair does not lead to any kind of redemptive moral message of a kind Malamud's writing often has. It rather I think reflects an ethic of the 'do your own thing' and 'me first' sixties about to come. Sexual liberation cancels out consideration of others.Perhaps I am a bit unfair to this novel which I started out enjoying and enjoyed less as it progressed. Malamud does do an excellent job of creating the university types and atmosphere, and does show meticulous attention to the kinds of minor disputes and pettinesses which plague faculty life.He also writes in a clean and precise way, and there is an air of freshness, and youthful adventure at least in the first chapters of the work.This is not the Malamud which the world will love him most for. The main character by the way is only nominally Jewish, and Jewishness plays no part whoseover in the story. This again is far from what one ordinarily thinks of one when one thinks of the work of Malamud."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"As a Northwesterner, I was interested in reading this book because of its setting. The descriptions of Washington State (my home state) were done pretty well, but the dialogue between the unrealistic characters was less than satisfactory. Malamud chose to ramble on, sometimes in two page segments, in inneffective attempts at a sort of social statement. The ending of this book was absolutely ridiculous."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"I am a long-time admirer of Malamud. In my view, \\"The Assistant\\" and \\"The Natural\\" are two of the outstanding novels of the 20th Century. I can still recall my gratification upon finishing \\"The Magic Barrel.\\"In the case of first-time exposure to a book,play,or movie, I believe that expectation frequently colors reaction. Given my experience with Malamud, I began to read \\"A New Life: with a sanguine attitude. The first page, carefully calculated to entice the reader's interest, validated this attitude. Although my enthusiasm waned over the next 20 or 30 pages, I reminded myself of Malamud's literary prowess. He's just having a little trouble revving up the engine, I thought. Happens to the best of them. My man will get off the ground shortly and we'll be soaring into the clouds.Malamud's early take on Levin bolstered my confidence. Levin is an unsuccessful teacher, a former drunk, a tactless, gauche klutz whose professional and intellectual capacity and social skills are, to say the least, limited. The reader will identify with Levin, or root for him, or feel sorry for him, or simply connect with him, however attenuated the connection, WHEN LEVIN CHANGES. And so, the reader looks forward to finding out what manner of event, what shift in circumstance, will rehabilitate Levin, or trigger his turnabout, or spark his transformation, or signal some incipient but viable adjustment of his personality and character. Or perhaps will reveal some redeeming quality, some suppressed side of Levin that is rational, perceptive, sensitive, sensible.It doesn't happen. Levin's self-destructive behavior accelerates, and the book plunges irreversibly into contrived farce and fatuous set-scenes devoid of credibility. Contrary to Mr. Lethem's Introduction, the book is neither comic nor tragic; it is simply hollow in its core.To revisit the credibility issue, Levin's attempts to insert himself into and influence campus politics are so maladroit as to be unbelievable. His relationship with Pauline is self-delusional and empty-headed, and is not plausible. The ultimate implausibility, of course, is the last segment.The book does contain well written descriptions of scenes from nature. But why so many? Some of the dialogue is clever in a stilted way. College-faculty environments are unquestionably as vicious as reflected, but surely the real-life intrigues are not conducted on the level of ineptitude depicted here. Beyond those small plus-factors, the book fails in terms of plot, narrative, and character development. Like Levin, \\"A New Life\\" is a loser. Come to think of it, Malamud's purpose may have been to write the book as a metaphor for stupidity."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"Jonathan Lethem's preface shouldn't be read first but last, as it--albeit subtly--gives away the ending for any reader who makes it to the latter third of the novel. While I did not support the choice made by the protagonist, Sy, at the end, and sympathized more than perhaps I was supposed to with the antagonist, I found this evocation of the Cold War period as spent at a cow college in a small town in the Northwest gripping and surprisingly convincing in its indirect narrative style, which mimics not only the patterns of thinking in Sy's mind, but springs off at times into Joycean reverie.I have only read Malamud's The Assistant, and that in college, so my pleasure at his plot became all the more pronounced when I found so much of the setting alarmingly familiar--I teach English too at a non-liberal arts college, run by number-crunching techies, so Sy's predicaments--although now I doubt if he could land his position without a PhD--stayed fresh despite happening half-a-century ago.Issues of academic freedom, nourishing of the soul, escape into nature and ideals vs. the mundane may be new material for those used to Malamud's urban explorations of often NY and Jewish characters, but here it all works. I was mildly intrigued that Sy's Jewishness never gains but one mention, near the end of the novel, but is assumed, I suppose, throughout as he is marked by his beard and his \\"East Coast\\" origins as an outsider all the time. The near-absence of religion and the substitution of a longing for nature, perhaps a Wordsworthian sort of wonder, permeates much of the lyrical passages interspersed with the more tormented episodes--which gain as the book lengthens.The book has a bit of slapstick and a lot of farce in the predicaments Sy gets himself into, but I can testify that much of Malamud's take on such an institution remains relevant today, in a much more constrained academic job market for such profs-to-be. Again, a measure of the skill Malamud brings is both the detachment the third-person p-o-v offers of Sy (who never leaves our sight) and the engagement with the other characters we see through his jaundiced eyes, and the fact, as I stated, that your sympathies may not be fully with Sy by the book's close."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"Bernard Malamud is known for creating deeply flawed characters with strong ideals, and Seymour Levin - known interchangeably as S, Sy, Seymour, Levin and Lev - the central character in this wonderful novel, is no exception. A thirty year old masters graduate, down on his luck, but with the backing of an NYU education, he lands a job as a college instructor in the English department of a fictional mid-western state (Cascadia) college. This opens up an interesting cast of characters who view him with a mix of interest, disinterest, partly an inferior, an activist/idealist (his beard suggests he is a radical in the year 1950 in the midst of red-baiting and community suspicion), a potential threat, an alien, an anomaly.Levin, \\"formerly a drunkard\\" (to quote the author) has deep seated problems and issues of self worth. He is a plain man, though definitely an idealist; however, one gets the sense early on that his idealism comes less from a passionate, inward set of convictions and more from a sense of inferiority, and a desire to find meaning in ideas. His activities and how quickly he reacts to the new environment are fascinating - he wastes no time getting inappropriately involved with a female student, sleeping with the wife of a trusting colleague or getting embroiled in the politics of the English department (here Malamud provides an interesting look at a college in a conservative town that values professional training at the expense of literature and learning) and being drawn into a myriad of ethical and moral dilemmas. Without spoiling the plot any further, Levin breaks every conventional rule in the book - this makes him less a sympathetic character and more someone the reader is almost glad to see suffer the fate he does. I would not have felt this way if I got the sense that Levin was fighting for something and doing it sensibly - while I love literature, the way Levin goes about seeking its elevation seems foolish and misguided. Perhaps more about ego and an attempt to feel worthy than out of a true love of books.This is in essence something of a morality tale, and if I had to get to the heart of what Malamud is saying here it would have to be that misplaced idealism - without moral or ethical standards - will destroy the person within. I found it to be both gripping and bleak at the same time, but surely one of my favorite Malamud novels (and I have now read them all, so will have to find a new author to stalk!).It seems that from the sparseness of the reviews here and from the seeming lack of recognition this book has received, it is one of his least known works. That is a shame because the characters and plot are fascinating; the themes are timeless (suspicion of someone who looks different, moral bankruptcy, clash of conservatism and radicalism, status quo versus change) and the writing is very good."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"I first read this book in college - I found it in the stacks in our library and chose it as a recreational read. Needless to say, it has become one of the most memorable novels I have ever come across; so much so that I bought the book to read again last month. Malamud's talent lies in his effectual portrayal of true to life characters and situations: S. Levin has a history of making the wrong choices, struggles to do what his conscience tell him is the correct path in life and battles to maintain his personal dignity -- all while living in a new state without emotional support. The administrative tug of war that defines his experience as instructor at a small state college are realistic and well portrayed - but also, they are written with a good deal of wit, making this quite the enjoyable read. I recommend it without any reservation!"},{"Title":"A new life","review":"'A New Life' by Bernard Malamud is the fifth novel I've read by him and with each book I am further convinced of his genious. He was a master at the novel (not just short story). Though his works are funny they are also deeply humane and, from a literary standpoint, subtle. I can't think of anything more difficult in writing than subtlety. Time and again, while reading this book I'd have to pause and reread a line or paragraph because of his subtle and miraculous use of language. The main character, Levin, is somewhat of a comic hero, but there is deep truth in him. His life is regret and he wonders when he will actually begin living. Already thirty, an outcast from the east in a northwestern college town, Levin's new chapter of life is on vivid, often comic and sad display for the reader. Another masterpiece!"},{"Title":"A new life","review":"Malamud's book is the story of a man who moves across the country to try a new life as a college instructor. As a college instructor myself, the politics he deals with rang true. I was mainly impressed, however, with the thoughts inside this characters head. I often read novels in which I come across something and think &quot;No man I know would ever think this&quot;, but I never felt that way here. I didn't like the ending (I thought the character made a bad choice) but Malamud is under no contract to clear his endings with me first. A good solid read."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"Malamud has written an entertaining novel about the attempt by the &quot;hero&quot; Levin to begin life anew in Cascadia (Oregon) in the 1950's, an era it is hard to imagine interesting - but it is here! And the end creates its own questions about new beginnings, love, the meaning of life, and all sorts of serious subjects, without ever feeling weighed down by them."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"New Life is Bernard Malamud's college novel, based on his experience teaching in a land grant college in Oregon in the 1950s. Coming after his success with The Assistant, and before his even greater success with The Fixer, this novel can be a bit of a letdown. The college professor, the departmental intrigue, the faculty wife having an affair with the outsider to the department, are all elements of the \\"collage novel\\" we have seen before. In this sense, there is nothing new here.But Malamud is careful writer, laying each brick of the story carefully on the other, giving this all too conventional tale his own unique solidity. He is fearless in what he puts his characters through, and his fairness to show how each on his responsible for his or her misery is unwavering.So, though New Life does not quite stand up to his great novels or short story collections, it is worth reading. Malamud steers clear of overtly Jewish themes, by and large, and charts through some new territory."},{"Title":"A new life","review":"If the Northwestern US fascinates you or you somehow find yourself there, this is one of the three best books set in the region. (The other two are &#34;The Oregon Experiment&#34; by Keith Scribner and &#34;Sometimes a Great Notion&#34; by Ken Kesey.)"},{"Title":"A new life","review":"A NEW LIFE has been around for over fifty years now. I first read it more than forty years ago. But it remains a favorite Malamud novel for me. I've worn out a few different mass market paperback versions in the dozen or more times I've read it (and taught it too, back in my teaching days).Although the story of S. Levin, \\"reformed drunkard,\\" and his married lover, Pauline Gilley, is set firmly in 1950, it still seemed relevant when I read it again this week (July 2012). It remains a classic novel of academia at its worst. A director of composition who cuts pictures out of magazines, hoping to publish a picture book of literature. A dean who was once a successful used car salesman. The frustrated 'old maid' instructor. The office/departmental politics, the genteel poverty, and the sexual intrigue and pecadilloes - it's all still going on in the small third-rate colleges around the country. The McCarthy-ism has been replaced by the ill-conceived \\"patriot act\\" of post-9/11 and the nasty partisan garbage that has rendered our Congress nearly impotent.But most of all it is Seymour Levin who carries Malamud's tale. More mensch than schlemiel or schlimazel, Levin comes across as a Sad Sack Eeyore sorta guy, but with big dreams of improving things, of building \\"a new life,\\" as the title indicates. Shot through with allusions to Hardy and the rural life, Malamud has nailed the academia of the post-war years perfectly. Much of this is probably due to the author's own years spent teaching at a small college in Oregon back in the 1950s. For more background info on those years, a reader could benefit greatly from reading Janna Malamud Smith's memoir of her father, MY FATHER IS A BOOK, which I found simply delightful and infinitely informative.Bottom line: there's a reason this book is still in print fifty years after its 1960 publication. It's just a damn good story. It'll make you laugh, because Levin does have a bit of both the schlemiel and the schlimazel in him, but it will be a wincing kind of laughter, because the humor is used for a particular effect - to show just how sad and complex life can often be. To show how sometimes even when you get what you thought you wanted, it will have changed in the getting.

FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH: BIRDING, OPERA AND OTHER JOURNEYS is not a memoir in the dictionary sense of the word. Yes, these are shared observations by a Naturalist who has visited his native England, Mali, Provence, Italy and America (now his home) and simply absorbed all the natural, at times rapidly disappearing, beauty of nature. For the reader who must have linear writing to enjoy a book, then this beautifully written volume is still accessible by reading only a chapter at a time. All of Urquhart's 'journeys' are descriptive of place, of people, of customs, of history, of local and universal mythology, of all the music in the songs of birds and the symphonies of natural wonders. While he celebrates and guides us a fellow travelers to embrace the wonders of the earth, he gently encourages us to heed his warnings. &quot;...we have yet to internalize our recent discovery that the earth is fragile and finite. Although our ancestors understood how to live in nature far better than we do, they had not discovered this important fact...The scale of the disconnect between how we have conceived of the earth in cultural memory and just how much we need it now to support our species for the future is beginning to sink in. It is a chasm we must cross before we are pushed over the edge by the demons we have unleashed in our wake.&quot; &quot;..our natural systems are at once source, symbol and symptom of our quality of life; their wise stewardship must be the standard by which any government is judged.&quot; Yet Urquhart, for all his convictions that we must preserve our natural resources, does not preach to us in this book. His primary concern is to awaken in us a renaissance of the wonder of nature. Walking the Provencal countryside he muses, &quot;The play of pagan and Christian, nature and man is finally distilled into pure delight, a whimsical descant that decorates the physical testimony of the timeless dance of man and the earth.&quot; Along his travels he has many diversions into his appreciation for the symphonies and songs of Gustav Mahler, the Ring cycle of Richard Wagner, Schubert and other composers whose music holds evidence of the naturalist's view, poets and writers. Urquhart's knowledge of the density of history, language, mythology, botany and ornithology of his visited places is astonishing. There is more to learn in this volume of musings than in libraries of dry reference books. Why? In his words, &quot;I have searched all my life for a practice that would allow me to celebrate Earth and nature as they deserve, to penetrate their wonders in the least branch, pool or leaf. It is a personal quest for something ecstatic or revelatory, something that will make my cheeks tingle or bring tears to my eyes.&quot; This lovingly and eloquently written diary of the earth is a joy to read and is food for thought as our society continues to chomp large bites out of hte earth's crust and atmosphere. Thomas Urquhart is a poet, a philosopher, and a simple birdwatcher with a profound message. Everyone should read this treasure!"},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"It's rare that I put down a book without finishing it, but I found myself in just such a position with Circle of Stones. I adore well-written historical fiction: well-researched fact woven into a compelling story, written in a style that engages and draws the reader into the middle of the action. The story must seem plausible, as though it *could* have happened the way the author tells it.Unfortunately, this book falls far short of the mark.The book is moderately well-researched (which is the reason for the 2-star rating), but the writing style is stilted (Brenda's lengthy narrative recounting her first experiences with Owain, is, frankly, silly), and the plot totally improbable. As an example: Why, if Owain's love for Brenda is as strong as he claims it is; why, if Owain values Brenda's keen intellect as much as he claims to; why, despite all this, would he give her the dubious choice of giving her newborn son to another woman *or* having it drowned all because of an off-hand statement made during an evening of drinking with the guys? This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, given the portraits of the characters drawn by the author. And it only gets worse.Then there's the issue of typos. While I realize that a mass-market paperback isn't of the same high quality as a hardbound edition, there's simply no excuse for the many typos I found before I finally put the book down.I haven't found another account of the Madoc legend, other than non-fiction versions. I'd love to see this story in the hands of a skilled writer.Meanwhile, if you find this period of history interesting (mid-12th-century and the civil war spawned by the struggle for the English crown between Stephen and Matilda), check out Sharon Kay Penman's &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept.&quot; It's extraordinarily well researched and well-written, with complete consistent characters and a believable story."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"This book is the first of a planned trilogy dealing with Madoc the legendary Welsh hero who is rumored to have visited America before Columbus and set up Welsh speaking settlements there. These settlements, which subsequently vanished, were the basis of those fascinating rumors in early America of a tribe of Welsh speaking Indians.After the birth of Madoc his mother, Brenda, flies to Ireland wish her new born son in order to save his life. She leaves Madoc in the care of Irish Druids and after she is re- captured by Madoc's father, Prince Owain of Wales, tells Owain that Madoc is dead and resumes her life in Wales, with it's royal intrigues, it's threat of an English invasion and the battle between old and new religions.Waldo has certainly done her research on 12th century Britain and sometimes it seems she doesn't want to waste any of it. We read much of Druid remedies and diets which sometimes hinders the narrative flow. The plot is slow moving sometimes, and there is the rather clumsy device of heading each chapter with a quote from a text to inform us of the historical events. I was grateful for the knowledge, for these were turbulent, confusing times, however it does lead to a rather jerky story line. The story is told almost exclusively from Brenda's point of view which means much of the action seems to be happening &quot;off stage&quot; and we hear of dramatic incidents second hand. The action does pick up as the story progresses and the book ends with Madoc preparing to sail on uncharted waters.The book has it's faults but I did enjoy it, largely because of it's subject matter and I look forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"I love good historical fiction. I agree with a previous review that this story had much potential, and in the hands of a skilled writer it could be wonderful.However, this particular version of the Madoc story is shallow, unbelievable, and at times downright irritating.My biggest complaint is that the heroine was supposed to be so wise, yet throughout the book she made clueless and weak decisions. She returned to a man who wanted to kill her son, and stayed loyal to him for the next 20 years, even putting up with his abusive family and endangering her own life. This makes no sense, and makes the heroine seem weak and submissive.My other big complaint is the total lack of sensory description in the story. We do not ever get to know the textures of clothes or other items, nor are there any vivid descriptions of smells or tastes. The 'feast' scenes were dry and dull. The writing is often textbook-style, telling &quot;just the facts&quot; with nothing to draw the reader in and make them part of the story. The characters were very poorly drawn, and their actions were illogical and unlikely. I didn't believe this story, and I'd wager the REAL people on whom this story is based would be insulted by the way they are portrayed.It also seemed like a very shallow rip-off of &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; telling basically the same tale using different characters.This book was truly disappointing. Skip it, and read &quot;Druids&quot; by Morgan Llewellyn instead."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"Waldo's Sacajawea is probably one of my all-time favourite books, so that's why I decided to read her series on Madoc. Although this book didn't grab me in the same way, it is still a very well-researched story about a little-known time and a historical person that not many know about. Her descriptions are very real, and in this book are actually quite graphic because the subject matter truly reflects the way that things were back in the 11 century. Life was short and terror, fear and superstition ruled all. I also found that the women in the book, especially Brenda, are very well drawn and they are truly remarkable and memorable. I think Ms. Waldo captures medieval Wales and the passions that drove men and women in these dark days very well. We laugh with these people, grieve with them, cry with them and love with them. That in itself is a sign of good historical novelist. Don't be daunted by the size of the book, or by some of the reviews. If you love historical sagas, then this book is one you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"Ok, so it's not as well written or edited as a Morgan Llywelyn novel, but it's not that bad and fans of Ms. Llywelyn will probably enjoy this book. It is incredibly well researched and I appreciated that the author included the rich details (which seem to have bothered other reviewers) because they put the story into the context of 12th century Wales. If you are interested in learning about Wales during the period of Henry and Eleanor of Acquitaine, I can think of no better book than this one. Finally, I disagree that Brenda was a weak and contradictory character. Instead, her decision to return to Prince Owein took tremendous courage and was based in part on loyalty to her father (who gave her to Owein for as long as he wanted her - a concept foreign to us in the 21st century) and, in part, for fear of her life and the life of her son. It is just not appropriate to evaluate women in the past [9 centuries ago] by modern standards. Brenda's actions demonstrated honor, bravery, and skill. But don't take my word for it, read the book and see what you think."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"You have to have Patience to read this book, it is a little slow in places but, I really couldn't wait to get to the Second book to see how the story continues and now am waiting for the 3rd book impatiently."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"This enthralling story of a mother who would do anything for her children and whats right is a must have to anyone who loves a heroic tale. This is the first installment of a two part story. This book is about a mother, who was betrayed by the one she loved(her cursed prince), just to find love and a great way of life in a small druid camp away from the castle in twelvth century Wales. She leaves her beloved Madoc with the druids at the small camp and returns to her place as mistress to the Prince. She studies with the near by druids and becomes a reknowned healer. But then problems arise when the new religionists decide to purify the lands by killing druids. In the midst of this the Prince dies leaving the throne open, causing the sons to fight each other and cause turmoil in Wales. This leaves Brenda in the middle trying to get to Ireland to her dear children and her third child, Madoc. This book is one of the best novels I have read. It is an ideal book for anyone because not only is it a historical novel, it is a romance novel, a war novel, and a suspense novel all in one. This book deserves to be cherished by all."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"When I read in the 'Circle of Stones' Afterward that the book originally spanned over 1000 pages and was split in two on the advice of Waldo's editor to make two separate entries of a trilogy, I realized why the book seemed pieced together rather than a complete and satisfying narrative. When Waldo sectioned her original manuscript, the strong and compelling style of her earlier work Sacajawea was muddled, resulting in a straightforward chronological genesis that neither intrigues or elicits the reader's interest.This first offering deals solely with Brenda, a Welsh handmaiden of the 12th century, mistress of Owain, prince of Wales whose son, Madoc, purportedly reached the Americas way before Columbus and may have founded the Mandan Indian tribe of North Dakota. Brenda loves Owain, but as one of his concubines, has little power to pursue her dream of becoming a Druid healer. When her third child is born and Owain demands that she give up this child to his bereaved wife or drown him, Brenda decides to flee Wales for Ireland. She successfully protects her child, Madoc, from their pursuers and only after he is fostered does she return reluctantly to Wales where Owain and his household engulf her again with their day-to-day intrigues. As Owain ages, Brenda finds herself in the tumultuous position of make-shift counselor. Fearfully, she watches as his older sons battle for a foothold in their father's realm; one in particular will use any means to gain control of his father's power. Her one hope is Madoc, whom the druids prophesized would accomplish great things for the Welsh people. When he appears in Wales a man grown, she finds he is the lightbearer to a path where she can realize her own dreams and simultaneously aid him in fullfilling his destiny.All the elements of a great historical drama are utilized in 'Circle of Stones', however, their allignment fails to achieve anything beyond a mediocre telling of the tale. Brenda curries no distinguishing character traits that memorialize her in fiction. Owain merely struts and then dodders and drools in a most unsatisfying predictable sequence of events that is meant to illustrate the threat Wales faced in an uneasy alliance with the English king Henry. Rather than compel, the third person narrative style employed by Waldo, bores. I have no intention of picking up the next volume of the trilogy. Instead I will research the Mandan Indians and their connection to the Welsh via the library and the Internet. Even die-hard druid fans would find 'Circle of Stones' lacking..."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"I love well-written, well-researched, authentic historical novels that deal with the Middle Ages. This isn't one of them. I think it may have been nominally researched, but the behavior of the people is implausible and the attempt at archaic language is deplorable. The author not only massacres modern English, she misuses archaisms in her attempt to create a medieval ambiance. For example, she uses \\"troth\\" when she means \\"truth\\" and \\" thine\\" when she means \\"thee\\". It is annoying and distracting. Furthermore, she changes points of view in an illogical way and never offers any insight into any of the characters or the era. It is an example of very poor, juvenile writing.

The druids are being persecuted in Wales and the sons of the king are fighting for the throne when Madoc makes his historic decision to find his way to the New World with a small group of people and found a new druid colony among the SE Native American tribes. A fascinating read, with compelling research to support the theory. Anna Lee never fails to deliver not only concise research, but engaging characters and story lines.

I personally found it an interesting account, from a woman's point of view, of the society of that time period with emphasis on the Welsh princes. It was the way things were, when people in power took what they wanted, and women did not have a lot to say about running things. It branches off at the end, with the main character escaping from Wales (to lead into another book). As my descent comes down via the people who stayed behind, it is doubtful I would be interested in the sequel. I found this book to be a good, well researched account, but it might be slow going for someone just interested in reading a novel."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"I have not read this book and so I can say nothing of its style or use of character development or language. All I can say is that I was directed to this series by a friend who knew I was deeply interested in Welsh and British history, particularly the 12th/13th century period.The review of this book on the author's website was enough to turn my blood cold, as a self-confessed history geek and though not an expert in high medieval history, I know a fair amount about the period and the characters Anna Lee tried to cover.I understand that this is a piece of work based mostly on following a journey that might have possibly taken place, rather than one which has heavy historical and scriptural evidentiary support, so there would be certain liberties the author would have to take.But as I have said, the review alone was enough to turn me away in horror from ever thinking of reading one book, let alone the series. If you are looking for something that is truly 'historical' run away and run now. However if you're content with complete fiction and understand that this is probably as far removed from factual truth as possible, then by all means, read on."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"I had such high hopes for this book-well researched?

The legend is fascinating, and the glimpse of day-to-day life in the royal courts of Wales in the 12th century is exotic and romantic, given the great distance that separates medieval Celtic life and modern life. Though the subject is inherently interesting, the writing is amateurish and cliche-ridden. I almost gave up on the book in the first chapter as I read Brenda's long exposition on her first encounters with her lover, Owain. It was embarassingly jejeune, but, knowing little of the Madoc legend, I stayed with the book for the story, not the writing. I found that I finished the book with a desire to know more about this legend and the history of medieval Wales, so in that respect I'd have to call the novel a success. By the time she has published the second book of this series, I hope Anna Lee Waldo has had the services of a good but ruthless editor."},{"Title":"Circle Of Stones","review":"I had such high hopes for this book-well researched?

For one, Circle of Stones was falsely portrayed as a romance, which clearly it is not. The rather pathetic and overlooked plot addition of a possible rendezvous between Brenda and a druid name Sein detracts from the story, and at times takes away from its credibility, especially at the end.

It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio hook-ups; but above all, it was read.\\" Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's impact: \\"The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel - in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms - of twentieth century American literature.\\" Within a year John Ford made a major movie starring Henry Fonda and in 1962 the Nobel committee cited The Grapes of Wrath as a \\"great work\\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.Perhaps it's most fundamental message is the equality of life, there is no difference between the poor and rich, other than a bank account, all life is sacred. Treat a poor person with dignity and respect and they will and can do as well as anyone else. It is a timeless message and one that bears constant repeating, although Steinbeck's treatment is a bit folksy and sentimental.Contemporary critic Carl Van Doren said \\"This novel did more than any other Depression novel to revise the picture of America as Americans imagined it.\\" The American image of the frontier pioneer moving westward had shifted to the Joad family. The Joads encapsulated the American character and spirit of independence, scrappy can-do hard-working virtuous, an American hero archetype. Martin Seymour-Smith says the work is fundamentally flawed because Steinbeck can not show why the California businessmen's behavior is wrong - after all, they are just trying to make a living, would the Joad's in their shoes have acted any different? \\"There is a conflict in him [Steinbeck] between the philosophical unanimist and the humane socialist,\\" in other word how the Joad's treat animals (as objects) but demand equality in humans. Thus the books message of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.In the end Grapes of Wrath is of epic proportions and a gripping story. It's often seen as the quintessential American novel of the 1930s and certainly one of Steinbeck's best (along with Of Mice and Men)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a quick comment, the ending of the book is different from the movie. The book is a bit more depressing, especially near the end. Overall, the movie and the book are similar in plot, but here in the book the reader will find much more detail. In short, the book is a literary masterpiece while the movie is good but not great.I came across an Amazon.com \\"Listmania\\" list for the top 10 American works of fiction. I had read a few of the books, but not all so I decided to buy all those that I had not read. These include the present book, and some that I have now read and posted reviews including Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and On the Road by Jack Kerouac. All of the books have been interesting reads and not what I had expected - lots of surprises.When I bought the present book I did not realize that this book is actually two books in one. There is a 44 page introduction (what I call the first book) by the Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott. His introduction is much longer than I had anticipated. This is in fact a mini-biography that describes Steinbeck's state of mind prior to and during the writing of the book. Also DeMott describes Steinbeck's life leading up to the book and what happens after the success of Grapes of Wrath. In addition, DeMott has \\"suggestions for further reading\\". So I would recommend the present book.It is hard for me to rate the Grapes of Wrath since it has become something of a classic with about 15 million copies or more in print. The rating is a bit subjective, but I would say 5 stars, even if it was not famous. The book is a \\"reality fiction\\" or simply realism, i.e.: pure fiction but like many other fiction writers it is based on real events that are accurately described and has a few characters based on friends of the author.Steinbeck received both praise and criticism for the book. Many thought he had exaggerated the problems of the migrant workers. But as explained by DeMott if anything Steinbeck who had first hand working experiences with the migrant worker has slightly moderated the descriptions of the hardships faced by the migrants as presented in the book, and in no fashion did he exaggerate their problems.This is a very interesting book and I would highly recommend buying and reading. It seems that the world has not changed that much since 1939. We still have migrant workers working under bad conditions although they are no longer from Oklahoma. They have been replaced by illegal aliens from Mexico, eager for the jobs. We still have some corporations and politicians trying to deny the reality of the hardships and issuing counter propaganda. We have perhaps even more problems today such as global warming, also denied by some. The world has not changed in 65 years - but the book is still of interest and perhaps even timely."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Just finished the book. I spent the first 1/3 of this book not very interested at all. I appreciated Steinbeck's passages showing the workings of capitalism, but found the dialoge to be pretty artificial and, since so much of the book is dialogue, found reading it pretty grating. About halfway throuh I was finally able to suspend disbelief and forgave the bad dialogue. I suppose by then I was deep enough inside the world of the book that I was willing to accept the dialogue as real - like one might accept the dialogue in bible translations. By this time, I was pretty interested in the story, but still not convinced I was reading a great book. Good, not great. This view continued until the last few paragraphs. I don't know what more to say but the ending took my head off. Wow. Its almost an hour later and I'm still having brief fits of tears. The ending was both devastating and inspiring. For a writer to manage that is genius.Whatever you do, don't skip to the end. Saving it will be so worth it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck was the book I read for learning more about the 1930's decade and was a very interesting book to me, and overall helped me understand more about the Great Depressions and what it was about. I'll admit I wasn't too excited about reading The Grapes Of Wrath, but to be honest I liked it a lot. To be honest, I did not know a whole lot about the Great Depression, just some of the really general, easy facts that most people know, or at least I would hope knew. I knew when it was, how the stock market crashed, and how there were very few jobs available. This book helped me understand what the depression was all about because it gave me a personal tale of someone living during this particular time in history. The main character, Tom, is released from jail and goes back to his family farm. After being gone for four years, he realizes most of his neighbors have disappeared, and one of the town preachers tells him that everyone went to California to find jobs. So Tom and his family travel over there, even though it takes forever because everyone is on the same highway to California, they eventually make it. As they arrive at California, one of the immigrants tells the Joad family that there are barely any jobs and throughout the rest of the book, they struggle to make money and keep their family alive throughout this hardship.For me, it is hard to imagine that a personal story like this was probably very common for families during the 1930's. It was sad to read that many of Tom's relatives actually died on the trip over to California because the conditions were so rough. Before I read this book, I thought there were some similarities between the depression and all the job losses going on right now, but now I cannot even compare them because they are so different. Sure, people have lost a lot of their jobs right now, and although that may be tragic for that single family, it is nothing like what happened in the late 20's and early 30's. Families had no means of getting food for themselves because in the book it talked about how many of the factory owners were scared of a workers strike, so they made sure that there weren't many jobs for them to have.Later on in The Grapes of Wrath, it explained how when the Joads were done picking for cotton season, they must return home to find work, but rumors around the country were that there wasn't going to be any jobs at all for the next three months. That may not seem like a lot, but 90 days is along time with no income. I was so interested after I read this book because it made me really appreciate everyone who lived through that tough time and made it out stronger. We should not judge any single person, or their past, because unless we are put in the exact same situation, we can't really have an informed opinion on it. I think from this book I realized how many really hard years that our country went through, and that it is all worth it because it can only make us stronger and give everyone hope to make things right again in the future. Personally I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I hadn't read Steinbeck since high school and I have to admit that the brilliance of his work escaped me then. It didn't this time. This book is impressive on many levels. Steinbeck has captured the reality of life in America during the Depression like few others. In doing so, he has also captured a snapshot of America that is both poignant and enlightening. The greatest works of art and literature transcend themselves beyond the immediate and become timeless and that is very much the case here. Most readers will find they have little in common with the Joad family and yet Steinbeck portrays the human side of an Oklahoma family so well that most every reader can relate to them. Steinbeck's brilliance is apparent in his ability to portray and to relate the human condition. It is also apparent in creating a work of vision that is both immense in scope and finite in detail. Oddly, in a tragic story largely full of despair, Steinbeck still manages to communicate a sense of optimism and hope for our society. This book is worth reading more than once and I have to agree with its rating in the top 10 of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book like no other one before it or after it expresses the dire situations that captalism and the endless need for profit that is built into the human psyche can create for our race. Steinbeck, a moderate leftist, portrays a family of &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; migrants as they travel through the Midwest to California, to seek land and new jobs(the banks supported by the government[in many cases being the same thing] pushed millions of people off their land at the time), but when they arrive all they find is people who are so corrupted by money and an endless fear of loss of capital that they do not offer the family any support or aid.Steinbeck wrote this book as a summation of real events that happened in the 1930's. His book realizes the need for social change in America and the world. It does not make anyone look &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It simply makes the system humanity follows seem like the one tearing us apart. Just one of the things that makes this novel maybe the best one ever written.

Throughout this journey they run into every sort of people --good and bad -- that will help, or not, them. Every new stop is a new challenge for the family, a new barrier to overcome.Not only is the story beautiful, but also very compelling. Steinbeck created an unforgettable portrait of those lives, which were so sad and difficult. One of the major qualities of \`The Grapes of Wrath' is the language. While the narrator has a clear and grammar-perfect voice, the author could reproduce the dialogues with perfection. They were written in the way those migrants would talk. It is difficult for the contemporary reader, but not impossible. Such device requires more attention of the reader, but it gives more pleasure once one gets used to this language.This novel interweaves two different kinds of chapters. In one of them the writer sets a general view of the migrants, their way of life, their habitat and such. In the other he talks about the Joads. Using such device, he makes the Joads' story universal. This single family could be everyone's who has to leave their homeland to find job and food in another place. The problems this family face are very down to earth. And, this kind of thing still happens everywhere.With \`The Grapes of Wrath', John Steinbeck created a story that criticizes not only the ferocious capitalism, but, above all, the human nature. The evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is an utterly poignant tale - a reading experience that rends the human spirit. My week-long journey with The Grapes of Wrath is an intimate one because it has the expressions of passions whether tragic or bitter that have been beautifully written, an ingenious verisimilitude that is as close as a personal story. Although this intimacy is only but a woof of the awesome fabric, the warp is its universal allure; its actions - alive, soulful, depressing and frank that appeal to any man and woman regardless of experience and race.The Grapes of Wrath reflects the hellish downpour of misery upon the farmers who lived and loved their land as much as their life but whose farms have been encroached by capitalists whose only concern is profit and wealth at the expense of the abuse of the farmers and their family. This is a great tragedy, an allegory, by which an enduring family travels through life's travails. The story revolves around their sensibilities of hope and survival, that in spite of the foreboding, they are dauntless in their seek for a better life. The Joads mirror the plight of the migrant workers- depicting the same suffering, the same fear and the same hope. And all the misanthropies that happened have its bitter toll on them, nevertheless under the frosting of modernity, within the fillings of promises of abundance by science and economics and above little dashes of fraud and selfishness. And all these infuriated the migrant workers but whose voice are stifled under the narcotics of hunger.The whole story runs toward a single-paced arrow but the characters bounce back a certain tense, or perhaps a curiosity. They play transparent roles in a way that a reader is carried along some of their introspections. In particular, Tom who is the main character is given a trenchant role in the movements and resolutions of the story while their mother who is such an audacious persona embraces the moral force so that the other characters maintain their moral substance. The other interesting character is the defunct preacher, Casy who constantly denies his capacity to preach again, and who eventually becomes a martyr for the cause of the Joad family and for the migrant workers which he led during the labor strike. The rest of the family and the other fleeting characters also played brilliant roles - either in rich metaphors or as colorful realism.Along the precarious highway 66, their life-story evolved and adapted as they settled in from camp to camp. It is depicted as free as flying dust, as treacherous as the desert at the roadsides and as promising as the land of the west. It is at this highway that Steinbeck rolls most of his radiant poetic flair. John Steinbeck has smoothly used paradox in his materials, he has proved a master in dialogues and his metaphors and symbolisms elegantly put flesh between the story lines."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The scope of this work far exceeds any novel I've ever read. In this magnum opus by John Steinbeck, he covers theology, philosophy, history, sociology, class struggle, and an awesome breadth of the topics of man. His attention to detail gives the strangest sensation that I am actually there in the wagon with the Joads, giving a personal feel to the novel that is untouchable by any other writer out there. Certain images are absolutely unforgettable: Pa's last stand, Rose's lasting image, the spell-binding oratories of Tom, Ma, and Jim.On the other hand, John Steinbeck knows this is magnum opus, but he sets out on a course to prove it to the reader. He can be pedantic, didactic, and overbearing in his writing. He is so absolutely blatant in his symbolism (particularly his religious symbolism) so as to leave a bitter feeling in the reader that the author thinks him a fool. Steinbeck can seem a times as if he's WORKING to create a great work, utterly unnatural.Looking past these misgivings though, this book is an excellent exploration into the 1930s as well as human nature in general. The characters are spellbinding, their dialogue excellent. The intercleary chapters are for the most part excellent snapshots of time, with the exception of those that involve absolutely blatant symbolism. While the progress of the book can be a tad on the slow side, I find that it gives the book an excellent feel of rambunctous wandering and exploring a la Ruthie, physically, and a la Jim Casy, spiritually. The status of this novel as a classic is wholly deserved, and it is also deserved of several readings to capture the full breadth of the novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"In The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck, the Joad family fled their Oklahoma dwelling, in search of fictional California jobs. Scarred by the Great Depression and the seemingly everlasting Dust Bowl, the Joads futilely traveled to California, a land they dreamed was filled with opportunity, countless jobs, and acres of fruit that one could pick right off the tree and eat. With a large family plagued with hunger, sickness, death, and a pregnancy, the Joads struggled daily to survive among the thousands of other refugees from drought and famine. Steinbeck writes with startling bluntness. Nothing he writes is \\"candy coated\\" or semi-truthful. He tells accurately of the troubled times the Joads faced and tells us exactly what they would have said. He uses the words, the grammar, and the thoughts that such \\"Okies\\" would have expressed; as shown in this passage: \\"Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Have to wait. Got no water here. Listen - that the rear-end? Can't tell.There goes a gasket. Got to go on. Listen to her whistle. Find a nice place to camp an' I'll jerk the head off. But, God Almighty, the food's gettin' low, the money's gettin' low. When we can't buy no more gas - what then? Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Little fella's thirsty. Listen to that gasket whistle.\\" I liked the honesty and truth that John Steinbeck writes with and thought it was interesting how he would shift gears every chapter and, instead of focusing on the Joad family, would show the reader a bigger picture. He stops focusing on one particular family, and illustrates the daily routines that every \\"Okie\\" family dealt with. I recommend this book to anyone interested in an awe-inspiring and shockingly true book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is the tits. I'm totally a Joadie (roadie for the Joad's) after reading this Steinbeck ca-lasssic. Bravo sir!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"SPOILER THREAT: MINIMAL. I've tried to stay general as much as possible.The Grapes of Wrath makes you feel vulnerable and exposed to a monster greater than all of us. It doesn't take much, a couple seasons of drought (in this case), you miss those payments, and pretty soon the bank has your house. What can you do? You struggle to find a place to live or find a place to die. The dustbowl isn't what makes us vulnerable, it's the system itself; tragedy like this can strike for many reasons, and therefore is, in essence, inevitable.Steinbeck was an incredible talent. A lot of reviewers have said the book is slow, but I disagree. The plot moves forward immediately, but I think reviewers are responding to a plot that sneaks up on the reader and Steinbeck's emphasis on voice. He alternates his voice seemingly effortlessly between the Oklahoman drawl in chapters devoted specifically to the protagonist Joad family and the other chapters that magnify the tragedy to multitudes of families suffering a similar fate.Not only is Steinbeck brilliant with his use of voice, but his understanding of cool transcends time. Tommy Joad is straight up cool, and he's as cool today as he ever was. The world loves a man that does what needs to be done: supporting his family, being a strong leader and brother, but also when circumstances force him to action, Tom won't back down, up to and including killing a man (or two), going to prison, and possibly leading a communist revolution. I'm not advocating these actions, but you can't argue what a great character Tommy makes.There is also a great deal of gender role development throughout. When things are good, the family is structured one way, but as things go bad, the family structure must react, or adapt. Characters are pushed to their limits and strength is shown as both a masculine trait, but also as a subtle and often deeper feminine trait. Some writers seem capable of writing dialogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints. I assume those that didn't complain, probably went out and hung themselves. Yes, it's a depressing book! That's the point. When things get bad, you have to do unbearable things to survive. The worse things get, the farther the Joad family is willing to go to help their family and others. The events push the limit of human endurance. You think this book would be worth reading if the Joad family found steady work and lived happily ever after? But the ending is also beautiful in a way, exemplifying love and unity of man. It's unpredictable through omission and inclusion. It's worth it, so finish the book.The Grapes of Wrath is powerful, memorable, and remains relevant to modern society; it is truly a classic work of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Never read it as a kid, kinda glad because so much would have been lost on an adolescent mind.

You rarely find anything like this in today's novel; imaginative and expressive in detail."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Another book group choice that I openly groaned about at first. I have only read one other of this authors books, \\"Of Mice and Men\\", and while I loved that book (and the film) I thought that this book would be a painful struggle to get through.I was right about it being a struggle to read and almost gave up at page 105. However, I am glad that I kept on reading to the end. It is a book that has many different facets to it and will make a thoroughly interesting discussion for a book group.The story is a hard one to read because it is just still too real in today's society, where there is enough for everyone but the rich would rather destroy it than distribute it to the needy. Now I am not a Socialist by any description but this book certainly did make me think strong and hard about it. I am looking forward to discussing this aspect of the book with my Russian friend who was brought up in the most extreme end of the socialist scale in Russia.The writing style was varied throughout the book. Some parts of it were very descriptive and emotional and really drew me into the feelings of the characters while there were whole chapters that I thought were just too wordy and did not add significantly to the book as a whole. I, initially, struggled with the vernacular of the migrants on the road but eventually got used to their way of speaking and, in fact, it made it feel more real to me and put me beside them in their lives.The ending was intense and somewhat shocking to me but it did give me back some hope in the goodness of humans that had been stripped from me by the rest of the book.4 out of 5 with one star deducted because it was a struggle and could not be described as an enjoyable read and would not be for everyone. I would suggest starting with \\"Of Mice and Men\\" if you have not read any of this authors works before as I think this book would put you off reading any of his other books. However, put it on your list of books to read before you die.Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person! And that is my closing thought."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I ordered these books to help my niece who is a high school English teacher and has no budget and no library at her school.She was thrilled!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"One of my favorite books of all time.

I was truly impressed by the art and detail that is put into this novel. The book begins with the telling of the truly hospitable conditions that farmers in the south-eastern plains were experiencing. The story follows a family named the Joad's and their desire and pursuit to get to California in search of work, easier times, and a happy life. Tom Joad, who is the main character in the book, is one who I became attached to early on, because of his rash and hasty nature, but kind and merciful attitude. His journey and growth really captured me through-out the whole book.The theme of the book was quite interesting. Humanism, unity, family, and the concept of the Oversoul persist in being the top reasons behind all the events that transpire in the book. The concept of Humanism, family, and the moral reasoning of leaving no man behind are powerful things. Ma Joad, mother of Tom, demonstrates the greatest form of humanism and family, by always wanting to help others in need, and making sure that people were working together to accomplish goals. She is also the one person in the family that is constantly trying to keep the family intact and functioning. Ma even gets physical when she feels her family is going to be broken up. This leads to the next theme, which is unity. Unity is shown in both the camps of people that the Joad's come across, and in a bigger sense of family, the community. The groups of people that the family stumbles across are groups in which everyone had a place, and people worked for the benefit of each other, not themselves. This is something that really takes a mental toll on some of the main characters, who go on to enact their newfound sense of place. Jim Casy, a former preacher, joins the Joad's early on in the book, and is really trying to figure out how to help people who are in need of spiritual help. He comes upon the idea of a shared soul, and no one person being separated from another. This concept of the Oversoul has a profound effect on both Tom and Jim Casy, who make steps towards who they are going to become through-out the book.This is a book that I truly do like, for all the detail and gritty realness of the whole situation that many people were in. However, it can get very dry, very quickly. The first part of the book definitely takes it's time to pick up, which it does, and it becomes very interesting after that point. The character development was excellent and I became enticed with the people surrounding the story.I recommend this book to those who want to read about the harsh conditions and times that people went through, but beware of some long, uninteresting conversations about life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Amazing story of dignity and the human will to survive.

Steinbeck defines the greatest elements of man, defining the vital passion that separates him from his bestial predecessors. And he demonsrates his brilliance and the insurmountable power of his diction by containing all the power and suffering that man must overcome in life with the mere description of a turtle crossing the road.I'm am a lover of novels, perpetually immersing myself in books.

I can clearly see from this work the reasons why Steinbeck eventually received a Nobel Prize. His syntax is creative, clear, understandable for those with less progressed vocabularies, but intriging enough for those with greater knowledge to remain intrested. However, this ending is quite vulgar, but, if taken on another level, it shows how Rose of Sharon grown. The end also leaves the audience guessing what happens next."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Here is a book about a family living in the most desperate of conditions. In fact, as the book proceeds, you come to realise that not only has this family lost its land - its home and livelihood for generations - but that they are also in danger of losing their lives, to of all things, starvation.Today, with our Western economies booming, low unemployment, improving standards of living, most of us desperate to lose weight rather than gain it, it's easy to take for granted the simple things in life: a roof over your head, enough food to eat, running hot and cold water, the respect and friendship of your fellow countrymen, the health of yourself and your family.What most impressed me about this 58-year-old book is that it made me understand something of what it must have been like for those people that made the terribly hard journey to California. I understood their dreams of finding a new home, new friends, new jobs, new life. I understood their fears as news started to filter through that things might not be so wonderful in the new world after all, that the future was increasingly uncertain. I understood their desperation as their loved ones began to leave or die, and their hunger began to grow.As the book proceeded, I grew to feel that these characters - Tom, the Preacher, Ma, Pa, Rose of Sharon, Winfield, etc. were real people, people I wanted to overcome the terrible treatment they received, to succeed, to survive.It shocked me that such horrors could have occurred just 60 years ago in the wealthiest country on the planet. Surely, if it can happen in America, it can happen anywhere. We know that many people in Africa and Asia still live in such squalor. Perhaps similar deprevations are now being inflicted upon the Russian people.Solzhenitsyn's &quot;A day in the life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; gives a moving account of a man living for his next meal in a prison camp. However, it is all the more shocking when you see a whole family living (or dying) this way.The ending of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; provides a shocking image, even by today's cynical and graphic standards. Even now, over a month since I finished reading the book, I cannot shake this image from my head. Perhaps that is the best tribute I can pay it: even after all these years, it's a book that still has the power to shock."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book was pretty good, but I think it could have laid back on the details. Overall, though, I think it was an O.K. book. I recommed it for high- school readers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I had John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath sitting on my bookshelf for several years and always wanted to read it. I started it one summer, but only got about twenty pages or so into it before I gave up. I didn't get back to The Grapes of Wrath until my freshman year of college when I had to read it for a Geography class. I wasn't sure why the book was assigned for Geography, but was glad that I finally had an excuse to read through the book. It was assigned at the begining of the semester, and I think that I finished it about a month before we even started talking about it.This book deserves every bit of praise that it has recieved. It tells the story of the Joad family, \\"Okies\\" who are journeying to California after their farm has been destroyed by both the effects of \\"The Dust Bowl\\" and the attempts of the United States government to control crop prices. At first, they believe that the \\"Golden state\\" is abundant with oppertunaties; Grampa is so excited that he says he wants to smash grapes all over his face when he gets to California. Yet soon all their hopes turn sour. Their trip exposes the rural farm family to the hardships of literally surviving during a time of economic downfall. The Joads experience loss of several family members and blique hopes for steady employment when they finally reach California; yet by the novel's end Steinbeck ensures that the Joads--and all the migrant farm workers in general--will continue to endure. Steinbeck inspired the characters in The Graphes of Wrath with heartfelt emotion, and by reading it you will truely experience their difficulties.A unique characteristic of the novel is that it contains \\"interlude\\" chapters after every narrative chapter or two. These chapters describe the the overall effects of others during The Dust Bowl and weave their way into the events of the Joads themselves. The first interlude chapter about the turtle is quite interesting and serves as a symbol of the story overall.This book is a must read for anyone and can be interpreted on quite a few different levels, including an allegory of the journey to the promised land. There are even a few funny jokes that I underlined in my text to remember. Although the novel may not imediately seem all that interesting, stick with it because it is worth finishing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I used to be dubious of the fame that some books have achieved, and wondered if the popularity was often earned.

When reading the story of the Joad's struggle, the only thing that you cannot feel is apathy.

Needless to say, I think it's a great book and thoroughly deserve it's classic status. Granted, Mr. Steinbeck wasn't the best in prose like an Anderson or Fitzgerald but I think the most important part of a story is the story itself and Steinbeck is a great story teller. I've never felt more anger than when the Joad's were called &quot;Okkies&quot; or more sickened when they were cheated by the farm owners. The style of alternating the chapters was quite clever and I think it just sort of builds up the suspense. The ending to me is just right although a bit melodramatic, it captures the essence of hopelessness that prevails throughout the book. I thoroughly recommend this book and Steinbeck will make a cynic out of you yet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"After losing their family farm in the red country of Oklahoma, the Joads must move to California to find their dreams and a better way of living. Together, they give support as well as life to their fellow neighbors who are experiencing the same difficulties of traveling to the west for a more satisfactory life.I thought this book was very well written by John Steinbeck because he brought out each character very distinctly. None of the characters were EXACTLY the same as another. I could almost imagine myself working together with the Joads, scraping around for food and water, trying to survive just for a better life. Steinbeck captured all the touching moments as well as the tough times that the Joads went through, and brought them altogether in the end.Another reason why I enjoy Steinbeck's books: Stated in the Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 1962 - &quot;The ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.&quot;Our imperfections that we often try to hide from the world is brought straight out to us in Steinbeck's books. He is not afraid to state the facts. But, even with those flaws we are working towards growth and development in our lives.I relate The Grapes of Wrath to Of Mice and Men because just like the Joads who are moving to improve their lifestyle, George and Lennie are doing the same on a smaller scale. They are all in search for their dreams and goals that they set for themselves. Furthermore, I do recommend The Grapes of Wrath if you want to experience the captivating characters and the hardships one family goes through to find happiness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is quite possibly the best book I've ever read. It is a story of the Joad family; a poor share-cropping family in oklahoma during the dust bowl. Having fallen on hard times thanks to bad crops and an uncaring system, they are forced to go west. Their journey exposes the very worst of class distinction. The Joads are forced to live in unspeakable conditions, and like the other migrant families are constantly harrassed and exploited by the powers that be. This is a vivid tale of the human condition and a message to all of us. Steinbeck does a masterful job of telling the story. He pulls no punches and makes no excuses for the barbaric treatment of the migrants. He tells a story that the world might have otherwise forgotten, and makes us consider the fairness of it all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a 9th grader I am a great fan of Steinbecks work. Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, and East of Eden are but a few of my favorite books. John Steinbeck has a way of digging into every reader of his books. His books help his readers learn about past events and even about themselves. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his greatest books, second only to &quot;The Winter of Our Disscontent&quot;. Grapes of Wrath is full of tragedy, love and suspense, yet remains to be a very intelligent and insightfull book on the human soul. Im not saying this book is for everyone though. Its 619 pages long and most of that is dialoge. Every odd chapter tells the setting of the chapter to come. This can become tedious but truly gives a vivid picture of exactly the Joad family and the country are going through. I do recommend this book, but I believe the reader needs to have a lot of patience and a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I put this book down, and I had no idea what to say. It was such a terrific book. I am glad that I picked this book up on my own, rather than being forced to read it in a class. I was able to enjoy it so much more and read it at my own pace. I felt myself seething with anger at times, laughing at others, and at other times just sitting spellbound by the excellent use of imagery. With so many books, a reader can find it hard to see in his mind what the author wishes a reader to see. With Mr. Steinbeck, I encountered no such problems. Another technique that I enjoyed (that other reviewers seemed confused by) was Steinbeck alternating between the story of the Joad family, and a sort of social commentary, every other chapter. I would rather Mr. Steinbeck DIDNT use quotations in these chapters. If he did, it may feel he was confining the situations presented in the &quot;odd&quot; chapters, to a single character. But by removing the quotations, I felt myself imagining that he was speaking for all the dispossesed, not just a single person. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A towering masterpiece. Realistic and poetic at the same time, angry and compassionate, and still amazingly relevant after two-thirds of a century. This brings the Depression more real than anything I have read, and yet it is far from being a depressing book. One of Steinbeck's themes is how when people are cast out and cast down, their basic humanity draws them together into a big family governed by the laws of simple goodness and compassion. Perhaps this is a sentimental view, but it is attained one agonizing step at a time. Against this he sets the impersonal forces of big business, a pitiless economy, besieged communities hiding behind a corrupt police force, and the indifferent hand of nature, portrayed in short interleaved chapters that can be lyrical or bitter, passionate or cynically understated.These short anonymous sections are absolutely necessary to the scale of the book, but some of them have a set-piece quality that at times seems somewhat dated. Not so Steinbeck's treatment of the main narrative, especially his portrayal of individuals: Tom Joad, prison-hardened and wiser than his years, Casy the preacher who loses his faith to arrive at stronger truths, and Ma Joad who holds the family together. These are people totally of their time and place, and yet timeless, a testament to the almost unquenchable power of the human spirit. And nothing is more moving than the way the novel ends: with a simple act of kindness by one broken human being to another, that in Steinbeck's hands becomes a sacrament of grace, bringing tears to the eyes and hope to the soul.[PS. I first tried to read THE GRAPES OF WRATH four decades ago, in England in my mid-twenties, but gave up. I found it impossible to follow the dialect, I utterly lacked the knowledge of American history in the Depression era, and I dare say I lacked the life experience to appreciate the book's moral strength. For the second and third of these reasons, at least, I thus find it strange that the novel is so often assigned at the high-school level. After living in the USA now for 35 years, it means so much more to me. This is not because of history or language, but because the issues which made the book relevant in 1939 are still present in American life today, in its politics, its corporate culture, some aspects of its religion... but also in the enduring human spirit which Steinbeck so powerfully celebrates.]"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As much a political manifesto as the simple story of a family forced to leave their family farm and seek a new life in California, the Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature. Set in the American West at the start of the mass migration to the West Coast, the story follows the Joad family from the foreclosure of their farm through the long road trip along Route 66 and finally to their lives as migrant workers in a land overflowing with workers. Their lives and hardships are vividly painted in Steinbeck's outstanding prose.Steinbeck alternates styles each chapter. Every other chapter details the story of the Joads. In the remaining chapters Steinbeck uses a repetitive, haphazard, ungrammatical, absolutely brilliant style to sketch a scene from the life of a migrant family, ostensibly the Joads. In these chapters, he conveys scenes such as the high-paced action of a used car lot, the bitterness of a family receiving foreclosure notice, or the back breaking work of cotton picking with such clarity and color that the words of the book seem to fall away leaving the reader with a tangible world in which voices are shouting or the breeze is tossing the cotton tufts into the air. In my own reading, I've seen many authors try to mimic this unstructured, repetitive style, but never done as well as this.The story is rich with symbolism and emotion. While there are some spots where Steinbeck seems to be working too hard, the book as a whole is a wonderful read. You will come away a little more educated about that era in America's history, a little more sympathetic to the plight of migrant workers, and maybe even a little more left-leaning in your political views. Regardless of what you intend to get out of it, the Grapes of Wrath is absolutely recommended for anyone of the maturity to understand the deep themes that run through the story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Although I have reviewed dozens of books, this is the first time I have felt speechless. It is not because I do not have anything to say, rather, it is because the book is so deep and complex and evokes so many feelings that I do not even know where to begin. I guess I'll begin by saying Steinbeck's ability to illustrate a book with just words is phenomenal. The imagery in The Grapes of Wrath is so enjoyable. Steinbeck describes every detail perfectly. You will actually be able to feel the hunger pangs, sense the heat of the desert sun on the back of your neck, and feel the hurt of death and loss. It is truly incredible.I really enjoyed all of the characters. I felt they were all well developed and had distinct personalities. Ma was tough, but always on the brink of being broken. She was like a teeter-totter - the slightest weight would send her to a breakdown. Tom was sensible and always under control. The two little ones, Ruthie and Winfield, were cute. I liked how they always repeated what they heard the adults say --- even if it didn't make sense! My favorite character though, was Casey the preacher. He really had a lot of insight to life. I liked they way he was always \\"thinking\\".For me, the only downfall of the book was trying to understand and endure the sandwiched descriptive chapters where no one in particular was speaking. These are the chapters in which other reviewers complain that Steinbeck should have used quotation marks. I really struggled with these. I know they were there for a purpose and housed a lot of symbolism; I guess that's why I was so frustrated. I wanted to experience those chapters the way Steinbeck had intended, but I found it very difficult. The good thing is that these odd chapters are very short (only a few pages) and they fall every other one. The \\"meat\\" of the book, (the long chapters) is where you'll get your enjoyment. Because of this, I am only going to give the book 4 stars; however, this is even a struggle for me, because in a way, I really feel the book deserves 5."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read this book in high school and did not pick it up again until I was 50. What a difference a few years makes! This book is about hope while facing incredible challenges. If there is hope, there is life. When the voices of the suffering come together, they simmer, begin to boil and rise up (hence, the wrath of the migrant workers). It is about finding strength in different sources (a mother surfacing as the leader of her family). It is about families circling the wagons and holding onto to each other because often that was all they had. This story has been told many times in the course of history of laborers and is the backbone of the unions. Chapter 29 says it all. Very moving. A must read over and over again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Highly recommended. Steinbeck's prose is used to superb effect in detailing the upheaval of the Joads and their search for a better life in California.To anyone that dismisses it owing to the fact that they read it in high school - re-read it. There is so much going on that a high schooler probably could neither grasp nor appreciate.As well as focusing on the Joads, Steinbeck also take time out in various chapters to provide a social commentary of the times in which the book is set. Farmers taking loans on their lands, the depression/dustbowl, banks/landowners questing for profits, car dealers and suchlike taking every advantage of others misfortune, destruction of crops to maintain profit margins rather than feeding the starving.Through this nightmare world the Joads and countless others have to find their way: death, family fracture and shattered dreams become commonplace. The ending is simply superb."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is one of the great books of this century, if not the greatest. Within its pages, it plumbs the depths of both hope and despair, hostility and love, family ties and soulless corporations.Probably most people are aware of the basic story line: the Joad family, forced off their land by the confluence of the great drought of the late twenties, the beginnings of mechanization of farming, and banks that care only about their bottom line, travel to California in search of work as harvesters. But once arriving, instead of the paradise they were led to expect, find little work, a hostile local population, and living conditions far worse than those in prisons.But this bare-bones description of the story doesn't begin to indicate the power of this book. Steinbeck's characterization of the Joad family, Ma, Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the tag-along former preacher Casey are extraordinary. Tom is the nominal protagonist, the decisive one who does his best to plan and get things done, but I think most people identify more with Ma, the rock around which all the vicissitudes of life thunder and break till they must retreat, defeated. Her main priority is just to keep the family together, keep on going, while still maintaining the dignity and honor that being human implies.But perhaps the real protagonist is America itself as it existed during this time period. The portrait of America is painted in alternate chapters from those dealing with the Joad family, mainly told from an omniscient viewpoint, and much of it reads like a prose poem. Here we find the description of the weather and farming practices that led to the Dust Bowl, a turtle determined to continue on his course, a truck stop vignette that just might break your heart, the soulless actions of the banks and land owners, the desperation and determination of those forced off lands they had farmed for generations, the used car dealers out to make a profit regardless of the pain their junk jalopies will cause the buyers, the vast river of migration that occurred in those same jalopies, and the communities that formed each night during their arduous journey to the magic land of California. These images have remarkable staying power - I don't think I'll ever forget that turtle or the dust-laden house knocked askew by the tractor. Much of Steinbeck's message and theme is presented in these chapters - one of the evils of unbridled capitalism and the virtues of socialism.This is a portrait of America in transition, from a mainly agrarian society to an urban mechanized one, and like all great changes the \`little' people suffer the most. Here we find workers willing to work for less than starvation wages, just to try and put one more meal on the table, before their children die in front of their eyes. And the owners can offer such wages, because they know there are always enough people who are desperate enough to take those wages, and that unionization and working towards a common purpose will not work as long as there are such desperate people. Steinbeck does indicate that there might be another solution to this dilemma, namely that the people in such straits must learn some other trade (car mechanic, radio repairman), but also shows that the great majority of people will never actually make such a change in their trade.After each of these chapters we return to the Joad family - and see the general portrait painted in living detail, forcing the reader to see more than the abstract, to see the pain and suffering, to hope against good common sense that there is some better ending ahead. But there is no paradise, no Pollyanna future, only a slide into more and more desperate conditions. When you reach the final pages, you will find what despair truly is, right alongside the indomitable will to keep going, just keep going.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a complex story of a migrant family from Oklahoma traveling across America to get to California, or \\"The Promised Land.\\" Once in California, they find it not so promisising. John Steinbeck thoroughly describes the hardships experienced in the travel to California. The reader travels looking through the eyes of both parties; the poor migrants and the wealthy Californians. Steinbeck perceives an authentic and contemporary description of the Great Depression. The Joads are a tightly-knit group, led by two main leaders, Tom and Ma, who are both amazing characters. Tom, the middle son, is the stronghold of the family. A smart and precocious young man, Tom leads the family through times of hardship and difficulties. Ma Joad is the female binding of the family. She is the mother, the strong yet caring fastening that keeps the falling-apart family together in their journeys. John Steinbeck shows himself as an advocate of female rights in this novel, displaying perhaps one of the strongest female characters. Between these two characters, the loss of the family is a minimal. Tom and Ma create a captivating and gripping story.John Steinbeck really makes the story, however, with his unique style of writing. He smoothly alternates between large chapters that focus on the story of the Joads, and smaller chapters that construe lifestyles, troubles, and ways of the poor migrants who have traveled to California in search of a better life, a new home, or at least a scrap to put on their table. Steinbeck is thrillingly descriptive, sometimes to the point of repulsion. For a work of fiction, the characters in The Grapes of Wrath are very authentic and practically existent. The book differs in many ways from my usual reading material, and stands out in my mind as an admirable representation of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of wrath is John Steinbecks masterpiece. That he never again wrote an opus of this caliber is of little matter. few others have,either before of since. Steinbeck tells the tale of America during the Depression,by making one family come to life,the Joads. Now a part of the american Lexicon due to the movie of the same name[and a later bruce Sprinsteen album,the ghost of tom joad},the Joads are once proud Oklahoma famers devastated by the dust bowl droughts of the 1930's[which Steinbeck describes brilliantly.} They gather together, tie up their meager belongings, and head out furthe west to California, the land of opportunity. Needless to say, their plight mirrors that of literally millions during that decade, and theier reception in California is less than welcoming. They fight with crooked cops,abusive migrant bosses and &quot;instigators&quot; in camps,until they finally find a labor camp that treats them, and others as human beings. The Joads,in their utter despair and poverty,retain, even ennoble the human condition, by growth and compassion and kindness. There are tow ways people react to adversity, to lash out or reach out. the Joads become, then, paradoxically,with their poverty and rough edges, the quintessential Americans:tough, undogmatic,principled,compassionate,not looking to take advantage even when the opportunity presents itself. The final scenes, with Tom forced to go on the run again,the final conversation between Tom and his Ma are astonishing, and Sharona {the roseofsahrona, as she is referred to] nursing a dying man with her breat milk intended for her stillborn baby, is as unforgettable as exists in all Literature. If Moby Dick is not the great american novel, then this is. One of the very very few pieces of literature as relevant as when it was written. as Masterpiece, a galaxy full of stars would not suffice, never mind 5 stars. MAGNIFICENT,UFORGETTABLE.A MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"That's what we learn from reading this Steinbeck masterpiece. The irrepressible Joad family takes an unforgettable journey west to the promised land of California from their bank-confiscated farm in desolate Oklahoma. Steinbeck utilizes the setting of the Great Depression to the fullest through his vivid imagery of the colors of grey and red, his naturalism, which makes the land a character in its own right, his transcendentalism and symbolism, both which bring ulterior meaning to many seemingly mundane goings-on throughout The Grapes of Wrath.Steinbeck brings to life characters that I empathize for and felt after 200 pages as if I were a member of their family rooting them on after all they had persevered through. The struggle of the Joads to put food on their plates at the end of the night after picking cotton or peaches all day long for next to nothing makes me extremely thankful to have food and shelter -things most of us take for granted. The Joads struggle for their place in society and for their identity, which was unconscionably taken away from them and thousands of other &quot;Okies&quot;. The Joad family undergoes a stark transformation from naive idealists to destitute pessimists and finally back to optimistic and hopeful for the future. Te Grapes of Wrath proves to be the definitive novel of the Great Depression and one that every American should read in order to fully understand the most apocalyptic time in American history and fully appreciate our lives today and the many luxuries that we all take for granted.

It is the unbelievably powerful story of the Joad family.

That is except for Tom (Jr.), incapable of containing his emotions- and because of that pays a price.It might be tough for us to imagine the world that the Joads were forced into. But it was not that long ago. It is an important part of (recent) American history that, I think, is often forgotten.This book is bleak. There is no silver-lining. But Steinbeck's honesty should be appreciated. He shows that many of the great things with which America entered the 20th Century, disappeared in the 1930s.

I HATED this book! I thought it was the most droll, boring, depressing piece of ... I had ever read, at that time anyway. I read it again a few years ago and was amazed at how wrong I had previously been! It may have just been the difference between reading something because I was forced to and reading something because I wanted to, or I may have just been too young and/or nave to appreciate it back then, I don&#65533;t know for sure.Anyway, since then, I have gone on to read every other book Steinbeck wrote, and this is by far my favorite! This is the quintessential American novel and Steinbeck is the quintessential American writer. His character development, historical knowledge, vivid imagery are amazing, and the underlying sediments of human goodwill in, granted, often depressing circumstances, should be an example to us all. The way that Rose of Sharon, by far, the most ego-centric character in the book, winds up committing the most self-less act brought me to tears every time I read this.Anyone who gives this book a bad review is either too young and inexperienced to appreciate it (as I was when I first did), or doesn&#65533;t know a thing about literature.

If you do like this, I would also HIGHLY recommend Woody Guthrie&#65533;s &#65533;Seeds of Man&#65533;, another, much more humorous Okie tale.Also, if your into Steinbeck, check out \\"In Dubious Battle\\", the 2nd best book he wrote."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. It is Steinbeck's classic, which is really saying something. I've read some bad reviews here (though one spelled the name of the family wrong), but I just don't know how anyone can give this book 1 star.The Grapes of Wrath is the essential story of that time period, as it perfectly sums up the Dust Bowl and the Depression era American. Out of this setting, Steinbeck creates vivid characters that you will not soon forget.This book is not, however, uplifting. Yes it is pessimistic, but he is trying to make a point. And it can also be dry at times, though when you finish it I believe you will have found it well worth the read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is easily one of the best books that I have ever read. I was one of the few in my 12th grade english/history class that read the entire thing from cover to cover. It tells the story of the Joad family during the great depression and the dust bowl. They make their way from their desolate farm land in the mid-west to california to find work in the many orchards and farms. This is an american epic that no one should skip reading. The only one complaint that I and many other people have with the book is the last line or two. It does not ruin the book but really hurts it's quality."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I say that because this book will leave you despondent. If you're already poor, this book might not inspire you to succeed. It might make you feel like you can't.The book is incredibly written and the intercalary chapters are informative and educational.Everybody should read and learn from this book but be sure to read something inspiring when you're through to build you back up mentally."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book was quite simply one of the most powerful novels ever. Any serious reader will be moved, inspired and humbled by Steinbeck's emotional, rythmic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The first John Steinbeck book i read, but absolutely not the last. The authors vivid descriptive language draws one into the world as it looked like in USA at the time. Being non-american it really helped me understand a lot of the time being - and in addition to the history-lessons ;) I also felt that i had spend a great time with a great book. Certainly a 20th century classic. I love it. Now you go read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It's a shame that the majority of people who read this book are forced to do so as a school assignment. I don't think you can fully embrace the scope of this work with the anxiety of a report hanging over your head. I was fortunate in that, I was able to read it just because I chose to. I found myself becoming completely absorbed by the book, to the level that it started to seem as if it were a part of my life. I actually felt empty after I had finished it, sort of the way you feel when you leave a loved one for an extended period of time.I would also like to point out, that I am not what you would call a bookworm. I read about 3 or 4 books a year, generally in the summer. I started reading this book while on vacation. I had just finished Hemingway's &quot;The old man and the sea&quot;. For those not familiar with the old man and the sea, it's less than 100 pages long. It took me the same amount of time to read both books (1 week). I think this speaks volumes about how engrossed I became with the grapes of wrath, considering it is over 600 pages.I have only seen bits and pieces of the film version, but I found it helpful to be able to put the face of Henry Fonda on Tom Joad. I do plan on viewing the film version, but somehow doubt that it could be that true to the book. I am curious how the film version will end. Based on the era that the film was made, I doubt that they can end the same.The ending is the only thing I found disappointing about the book. As I read toward the last few pages, I started to realize that it would not end in any sort of finality, unless it were a catastrophic tragedy. If ever a book needed a sequel, this one begs for it.If you read this book as a student, and as part of an assignment, I would highly recommend re-reading it. It has the potential to make one realize just how fortunate most of our lives are, and how insignificant most of our problems are."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of the Joad family, a poor farming family who have been forced off their land and journeyed west to California in search of prosperity. The story of their continuing hardships gives the reader a personal connection to the plight of the poor population during the Depression.This was an excellent novel, putting the human face on one of the darkest periods of our American history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a wonderful story that will take you on an often painful journey. The characters are so vivid and one can really emapathize for what they are going through. The story tells the larger story of a nation in transformation. No longer will small farmers be able to compete with large corporations. The spirit and determination of Ma is admirable as she maintains perspective and hope in the face of so many tribulations. This is a story of survival and the strength of family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The gem has it all. Humor (you'll laugh out loud at some of the scenes), frustration, beautiful imagery not difficult to understand and ulimately, love. You will believe the ultimate triumph of love and compassion we have for each other as family no matter who we're born to. Let yourself see the pictures in your head Steinbeck gracefully describes as he writes. It's not hard. It's not difficult reading. If nothing else, read the part about the one-eyed man getting hilarious, believable advice about how to succeed with women. Great laughs!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Truthfully the only reason I read this novel is because it was part of my summer reading assignment this year for highschool. Somehow being told you HAVE to read a book rather than wanting to on your own makes the reading experience something to dread. Well all I can say is I am SO GLAD I HAD TO READ THIS!!!This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I have added it to my list of favorites way up there with Animal Farm (people think 'cause they read it in junior high it's for kids, WHATEVER!!)and Wuthering Heights. Every chapter is a feast for the mind. You can picture ever bead of sweat, every loss and tear as if it were right there in front of you. The story goes from humorous, to serious, to hopeful, to emotional so quickly you almost don't realize it's there till it hits you.The story takes place in the 30's based on real events, following the fictional accounts of the Joad family. Apparently back then, there was a crisis where farmers had overworked their land to the point where the soil had been reduced to worthless dust annd could no longer grow crops. The bank then had to take it from them because, well, god forbid they lose any money. Thousands, maybe millions of people were kicked out from their homes, the homes that their grandfathers had built, where children had been born and lives been lived. They were forced to all move west to California, selling what little they had for cash, dreaming of a new life. Flyers promised work and good pay, but when only 10,000 workers are needed, and 100,000 see the flyers and come looking for work, what happens then?This is a story of survival. Not like in that movie Cast Away where he's stranded on a deserted island with no food or anything, but a time not unlike today. A place filled with stores and restaurants and yet a man still can't feed his children and they are dying from malnutrition. How can you buy food if you don't have any money? and how can you make money if there aren't any jobs? \\"water water everywhere and not a drop to drink\\". And hungry men become desperate, which turns into fear, which becomes anger, and this makes teh Californians afraid. So wages drop to pay for security, to pay for more sheriffs and police and spies, and all the while this anger grows...Like I said this is a wonderful book. I'm so glad I read it.Some parts were so touching I actually cried a little. They weren't even necessarily sad but very moving. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone as a great read. Yeah and to the person who said teenagers can't appreciate a book like this, I guess I just proved you wrong."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck's Graphes of Wrath is an amazing book.

I raised my verbal by 160 points just after reading it (note that I didn't use any other prep material - just the book!)

But, as I read through it the plot developed into something a reader can appreciate and understand. Steinbeck's small 'metaphorical' chapters (that occur seemingly in every other chapter) enhance the message of the book. When I finished this novel 600 or so pages later, I realized my attitude towards life had changed. You come out for better or worse, a little different after reading this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I was much more impressed by Steinbeck's distinctive writing style than I was with the general concept of the book. The author brings characters to life better than any book I've ever read. It's very difficult not to be enthralled while reading The Grapes Of Wrath. The book has historical value, and sentimental value aswell. And it just simply belongs in any personal collection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I did not expect to like this book because I hated Of Mice and Men, but I really liked it a lot. Although slow at times, I thought the way that the plot was layed out, and the strange inter-chapters were intrigueing. The story was extremely believable, and I found myself wanting to know what would happen to the Joads next.This is truly a great piece of American literature. I'm glad I was forced to read it in English! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; takes place in the 30's. It starts with Nate Joad coming back from prison to his hometown in Oklahoma. He returns to find that the banks are repossessing land because the farmers could no longer afford to pay their loans back. (Also, the stock market crashed which brought &quot;The Great Depression&quot;) When he returned his family was evicted from their land and living at their parents (his grandparents) house. The family had received fliers about California. From there, they decide to head west. The Joads loaded up the old Studebaker truck, full with all belongings, and went to &quot;Get their kicks on Route 66&quot;. Which was the only highway connecting east and west coast. Many problems were encountered on the way there. This is where life took on a whole different meaning.This book was like a real person. It had flaws, imperfections, but also had character and personality of it's own. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; wondered in and out of little sub stories while, all the way it kept on a main story. The little sub stories served a purpose though, they all had a little meaning that built into the main one. Sometimes the sub stories became a nuisance, because when the real story was getting interesting, it switch to something else. The book was also slightly long winded, but was still well done all in all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"No one really needs my opinion, this book is a CLASSIC.

A lesson learned!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Everything was great with the ordering process; however, there was an awful lot of notes and underlining from the previous owner in the first couple of chapters.

The story is not at all dull, the characters are pleasant, and even the feel of the book is comfortable(the paper is not starchy and hard to handle like so many novels).

I began by liking the movie and then read the book. Important deatales are left out of the movie and they should be featured. This book shows the struggle of a family unaceppted everywhere they go. It shows the prejudices felt by people just because they are different and don't know the way of life in California. It is a wonderful book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath in 1939 on account of the great dust bowl in the 1920's. This horrible blight upon the land caused the topsoil to be literally non-existent; choking off crops of grapes, corn, and other crops that tenant workers of the time depended on for every day survival.The Grapes of Wrath is indisputably Steinbeck's best novel ever written, and is one of the best and most well known novels in history. The Grapes of Wrath also brought Steinbeck a Nobel Prize in literature, and world praise for his realistic depictions of daily, southern California life on the ranch, and the troubles that eat at the inhabitants daily.The Grapes of Wrath is a story that starts out with tom, a regular man, who is in search of his family. Tom soon finds out that his family has been forced to move to California the land of \\"new opportunities,\\" because the bank had repossessed everyone's land in that region for the growth of cotton, since the soil was so bad. Along the way, however, the family undergoes many hardships such as lack of money, food, and low, tired spirits. Finally, the family reaches a fertile valley in southern California where peaches are grown. The family picks the peaches for the farm, but soon loose their dream job due to difficulties. The family must now resume their search for a suitable job that is capable of supporting the over ten members of the family. The question is, will the family get their needs met by the new job, or will they find that hardships are too difficult in California, and they must move elsewhere? Steinbeck used chapters in the book describing the main family of the novel, but meant to be a broader, more generalized group. The dialogue in these chapters is not suggested with quotations, but is rather noticed by the reader through the different tones. This gives the further impression of hardship by allowing the reader to make associations to ones that they know whom have gone through the likewise.Steinbeck's classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a very sad book, however shows a very realistic view of life at that time and location. It shows themes of endurance through hardship, the importance of family, and that one day, a hope may be come upon, no matter how hard it may be to get there. For Steinbeck's great story telling capabilities, as well as his great usage of local dialogue, intricate character description, and portrayal of daily life, I deem this one of the best novels that I have ever read, and I gladly recommend it to all those who are up for a good classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, I believe, can be compared to such stories as &quot;The English Patient&quot; and &quot;Das Boot&quot;. While few if any of the people in these stories actually existed, the events portrayed did happen. Whether or not the latter two are more lushly romantic or exciting, respectively, it's a lot more enjoyable reading historical fiction than some dry textbook account. And, while &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; does get a little draggy and detailed for most modern tastes, try slogging through &quot;David Copperfield&quot; some time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"In 1987, I read &quot;East of Eden&quot; and it immediately raced to my top 5. Timshel! For over ten years I did not want to over-Steinbeck myself, so I waited until the proper time to read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (sadly, it was not required in High School). Well, now was the time and I did NOT want this book to end. I lived with the Joads for just three days, but I aged years in that time. That book resonated deeply in my soul. I wanted to melt inside the book and help them...I wanted to live with them so I could share the load...this book has made me a better person by opening my eyes to the plight of the poor. My '90s eyes kept expecting a newer stranger to deny the Joads help, to not share their food, to not lend a hand. But that moment never came. Everyone pitched in when things got rough - except, of course, the ones who could monetarily afford it. How little our society has changed in 60 years! This book should be required of ALL 16-year-olds. But as I found out this week, a 34-year-old can be deeply, deeply affected as well. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A CLASSIC! JET FUEL FOR YOUR SOUL."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a book that cannot be read quickly. The slow pace of it gives the reader more of an opportunity to fully appreciate the greatness of Steinbeck's talents. This is a story of how people adapt to poverty and despair by increasing the concept of &quot;family&quot; to encompass all of those suffering the same conditions. Being united against &quot;them&quot; (the banks, the landowners) is the only way to survive. This is shown on the group level by the self-governing government camp and on the personal level by Rose of Sharon's act of kindness to a starving man. Steinbeck does a masterful job of developing the Joad family - from Ma Joad's increasing strength to Tom's gradual enlightenment. Steinbeck was, indeed, a genius."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book has a good theme and VERY descriptive writing. The characters are protrayed very well and the sufering the family goes through is heart wrenching.

Read it for sake of your soul."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I have just finished the Grapes of Wrath a couple of weeks ago after it was sitting on my shelf for three years. I must say that it was perhaps the &quot;deepest&quot; American novel of the first half of the 20th century that I am familiar with.Even though the times and way of life it chronicles are long gone, there is an immediacy to the writing that transports one to what the Joad family, and all dispossessed families of the era, must have felt and endured.The novel is imbued with a sweet sadness much of the time, but there is also a spirit of faith, decency, and joy that this brave family, not soon to be forgot, displays which is quintessentially both American and universal."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This wonderful book, while slow and sometimes hard to drudge through, is an insight into the plight of the farmer during the dustbowl.

It is a complete joy to read the melange of roadside towns and attractions that seem to haunt the Joads' journey. Their jalopy becomes a metaphor of a broken down world that entraps them. However catastrophic the tragedy becomes, it is a slow and deliberate kind of grief. There always seems to be someone to help send the Joads' on their way. The tale hits home when the Oklahoma family reaches California, the land of hopes and dreams, of liberty, for the Joads' and the rest of the nation. There awaits them a cauldron of discontent among those sharing a similar fate, in the migrant worker camps. Of course, like all Steinbeck works, the novel ends on a dark, albeit sardonic note that is brilliant and one that only he could have produced. This book was a benchmark for what has become the great American road tale"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When I read this, slow, steady book, which mirrored the pace of the jalopy moving from Oklahoma to California, I felt like someone was beating me over the head with a small stick. It didn't hurt at first, but it kept getting worse and worse, more and more depressing. But just when I thought I had reached rock bottom, the ending gave meaning and even satisfaction like no other book has ever done.Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"If you give the book a chance it will change you in ways you never before dreamed of. The Grapes of Wrath stacks up in its theme and scope to the greatest world novels, such as Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, Of Human Bondage, War and Peace. Its scope and theme are universal. Its ultimate message: Human dignity and suffering. If the Grapes of Wrath doesn't stir and shake you, check your pulse. A powerful and arresting masterpiece that should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves a member of the human race, and who has ever suffered deeply and wishes to be healed by the power of humanity.

The Joad family epitomized the wave of mid-westerners that were exploited during the dustbowl years by large farm owners. You feel for them and hang on their every hope and feel their agony as they are used by shysters, on the way to losing everything they have. The tale is so gripping and heart-wrenching! Another example of why Steinbeck is my favorite American writer!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I can remember reading this book in high school, and again in college. It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with. No other book that I have read captures this period in America's history better than The Grapes of Wrath. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I felt that this book was amazing.

We, like the Joads, are all immigrants. Their story is the story of America. The migration from Oklahoma to California mirrors the migration from Europe and Asia to America. We all have a common bond with the \\"Okies.\\"While Steinbeck does seem to propose a collective style economy in several of his works, he also is able to identify the fierce individualism that has allowed a nation of immigrants to survive and prosper in a harsh and unsettled land. I think that he is off the mark in demonizing the haves and glorifying the have-nots. The true story lies in the battle of the just against the unjust. The struggle between givers and takers. There are good and evil on both sides.I did not especially care for the ending. I would have preferred that he follow Tom to some sort of climax as he stood out as the central figure all along. Of course, Ma was equally important and worthy of attention.In summary, we have become a soft people. We have forgotten the struggles and hardships that were overcome by our ancestors so that they might simply survive. There is, most likely, a strong spirit within most of us today. Unfortunatley, this spirit is buried very deep and held down by our numerous creature comforts and distractions. The Joads, and all of those like them, were no better than the rest of us. The circumstances of their lives, the proximity to mortality, forced their spirit to the surface.To me, the importance of this book is that it causes the reader to take a breath and to reflect on the struggles that we all are confronted with. We all have our desert to cross. We are all the same no matter how hard we try to be different."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a wonderful way to understand what its like to be truly deprived of the things we treasure most in life. it helps to better understand how precious life and family are. one minute they're there and putting up a fight, and the next thing you know, they're gone.

The plot was fantastic and moved at a relatively quick pace. I didn't find any lulls in the story developement. The only weakness, which isn't a big one, was the ending.

I made this mistake because the introduction is incredibly long. then after the introduction-to-the-introduction, it begins a chapter-by-chapter breakdown and analysis. You might understand why i mistook this for the main body of text when i was 10% through the ebook and there was no sign of Steinbeck anywhere. If you are not a lit geek and don't want to read a complete commentary first, avoid my mistake and open the table of contents and go straight to chapter 1. Otherwise i thouroughly enjoyed this one.

The narratives describing a place, an event, a feeling or emotion were so well written that the reader would feel transported back in time, to the place, made to see the event as it happened, made to feel the emotions. This, no matter if one has to struggle to understand some of the spoken words in context.A lot can be learned from this book, not only about history and the appreciation of what we have in the present day, but also more about the human strength, tenacity and innate goodness in the face of a seeming insurmountable adversity. I really wish it has a happier ending, say a reunion of the Joad family, or better times...but really, what happier ending could it have than one's giving of self to a stranger in dire need?

(Including patients with M.E.!) It was good to see such issues dealt with in a novel though and in such a non-heavy handed way.I also just loved the language.

As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland. I also found that these Scottish \\"Holy Fairs\\" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem \\"The Holy Fair\\", as can be found inPoems and Songs of Robert Burns. Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events. Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense! As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth. Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac. In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a great book. I finished reading this in December(now it's April) but I still remember how realistic this was written by Steinbeck. He makes the characters come alive and breathe. Their hard lives are seen as heroic and well done scenes in a long play.This is supposed to be a communistic version of California with the scenes of the goons beating up the union leaders. Look now what is happening to destroy unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio(pretty soon New Jersey, Florida, and who knows). So Steinbeck was right in 1938 to portray unions as the enemy of the rich capitalist ranchers and agricultural powerful interests. The poor Joads were only trying to do honest work and look what happened to them.First the banks wouldn't lend to them back in Oklahoma so they decided to travel to California to make a new living. Then when they tried to make a little more money they were beaten by the union haters. Their camp was destroyed by the owners.Supposedly John Steinbeck wrote this in 5 months in 1936 at the time of the Dust Bowl. This is history that is rarely taught in America today. Young people should read this American classic. There is a Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, California and I hope to go there as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"BORING.

Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting. Also, in my opinion, the ending was somewhat sick and twisted.So if you're in for a long read with a lot of symbolism, the Grapes of Wrath is the perfect book for you.

This book shows how america has changed from a state of chaos and uncertianty in the dust bowl of the 1930's. Now it is a state of what america was meant to be, a land of success and prosperity. We truely see America as a place of confusion and uncertianty in the entire trip that the Joad's made. The Joad's don't know where they are going throughout the whole trip they were going to a better place for everyone(so they thought). The confusion happened thoughout the whole trip because they had heard so many good things about this wondewrful new land of work and money. As they go their though they realize through the people coming and going from the land of 'prosperity' that it isn't all that it's cooked up to be. They learn through people and their own experiences that the land of prosperity for one man isn't that for the other. But, they are confused and uncertian about this througout the whole book until at the end they realize that this land doesn't mean prosperity, it means death for them, but at that time it's too late.I didn't like this book because I believe it took to long to get to things. I think they could have cut out several chapters about the tractors and migrates because they just repeated themsleves and didn't really state a strong knew point. I would have enjoyed it more if they had condensed it and threw out some of the unnecessary stops and converstions as well as chapters and people they meet. I do believe most of the people were important like the Wilsons and the people at the government camp like Thomas, Mrs. Sandry, etc. But, the people they talk to at the stops sometimes and people they associate themselves with for a night that takes a chapter. Why do you even put them in? This book could have been a lot shorter if you cut out alot of the unnessecary things.I think this book has very good themes and gives you a good idea about what the 1930's and dust bowl was like though. I shows you the pain and suffering that people had to endure in different ways and ages. They showed you the Granma and Granpa, Ma and Pa, Al, Tom, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and Casey, Winfeild and Ruthie. Each person show you how this effected their age of people and the way they did things and conducted themselves. This doesn't acount for everyone in their age group, but a good portion. One example is Tom. He resembles the common worker who is ambicious and angry at where he is. It shows him nearly killing himself to try to get fair work and to be respected at the same time. Everyone resembles a different group in America and how they were effected by the turn of events that was happenign in America.I liked the books purpose, theme, and reasons for writing it. I think that some of the individual componients could have been changed, but over all I can look over those and see a very well written book with a great meaning and purpose."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath had to have been one of the most boring books I have read in my entire life. The plot is switched around so many times it is confusing, the some of the characters were given way too many names, and I couldn't tell what character was being talked about half the time. Most of the book is entirely pointless and the important part of the story is about ten pages long. The plot of the story is boring, and the story its self is ended in a very confusing manner.

The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead.

It is a marvelous story of the Joad's struggle across the country to California to make a living for themselves after their farm was reposed by the bank. You follow them every step of the way through different problems; death, starvation, jobs, and cops. You gain a kind of bond with and empathy for the characters. You care about what happens to every member of the Joad family. You would be sad if they never made it, but at least you would know what happened to them. You never find out. In the middle of a crisis Steinbeck decides to drop you like yesterday's sour milk. It drove me nuts.If Steinbeck had had some sort of ending to the story, it would have been the best story I have ever read. It has no ending. The book is like one of those really annoying sequels that draws you in, gets you addicted, and then says to be continued. Well it is just your luck that you don't get a sequel; there is no to be continued.Other than the minor detail with the terrible ending, it is well written with a style that is easily comprehended. Anyone could read this book. It has what I like to call &quot;story relief chapters&quot;; that is a chapter between each chapter on the main story. These specific chapters give you a view at the world around the Joads smoothly. These chapters don't even mess up the flow of the story.So in conclusion, this book is well written with no ending. I give it three stars because a book can't only have a good story, but it must have a good ending (or any ending for that fact). You can judge it for yourself if you do read it, but that is my review."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I find it highly irritating when others start acting condescending towards people just for not liking their choice in books. I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH &quot;for fun&quot; (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an &quot;immature&quot; reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy &quot;serious&quot; books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste. I personally love Lord of the Flies, for instance, but I understand that there are those who do not.

The fact that it is considered such explains many of my problems with American literature and American culture in general. In order to show what a poor contender this novel is, I'm going to contrast it to something that's actually great literature, Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky.Where to begin? First and most importantly, the narrative is uninspiring. The prose is dry, dispassionate and bland. Not dessicated and spare and powerful like Camus, but just dull. The interchapters, in particular, are tedious and pretensious exercises in literary superfluity. All of your middle-school english teachers no doubt told you that when you write something you should 'show not tell,' and that's good advice, but Steinbeck just tells you the story and keeps telling it for 600 miserable pages. So thus the manner of the novel's writing adds nothing to the book, and indeed detracts from it. Contrast this to a novel by Dostoevsky like Crime and Punishment or Notes from Underfround where the narrative itself is feverish, illucid and grating, reflecting the protagonist's wretchedness.Next, all the characters are delightfully black and white, on the whole. Casey is messianic, the men killing him are devils, and there's no in between. Contrast this to the moral ambiguities of Crime and Punishment and you'll see why Steinbeck comes off the worse.On a related note, the novel seems to have no means of conveying a spiritual message of its own, since the prose is so soulless, but Steinbeck tries to make it spiritual by inserting Casey's tedious neotranscendentalist sermonizing. Contrast this to Crime and Punishment, where the moral is so integral to novel that any expounding of it is entirely natural.So if you enjoy complex, multilayered characters, an interesting writing style and stimulating philosophical questions in a novel, stop yourself before you pick up this inexplicably 'classic' novel and read something by a Russian instead."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is one of those intimidating \\"great books\\" that everyone knows about and no one reads. The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all. The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position. The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph. The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel. Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole. Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication. This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"If any novel could sum up the tragedy the Great Depression was for the working classes, this is it. I liked almost everything about this book--the characters, the story, the history, the dialogue. One of the only complaints was the abrupt and pointless ending, although I do commiserate with the author because how do you end a novel such as this? This novel is a masterpiece in itself as well as in what it accomplished by bringing to light the impact of the Great Depression on the working poor. It's hard to know if this story is the worst of the worst or just the story of an average family during this time. Either way, it's a tragedy and very moving. As a sidenote, Steinbeck definitely exhibits a hope in communism and socialism to bring equality and end the kind of poverty illustrated in this book. When this book was written, history hadn't yet judged the communist/socialist experiment which has now been shown to be responsible for more injustice and poverty than what it replaced. Along those lines, the novel's villains are the \\"big bankers\\" and \\"big farm owners.\\" Ironically, FDR's New Deal policies dictated price controls for farm goods and wages which led to mandated government destruction of food during the Depression. So, the New Deal was just as big a \\"villain\\" as the bankers and farm owners even though the book leaves that part out."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays!

What a magnificent novel! I'll never take food for granted again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read.

From all of these the people are in flight, and they come into 66 from the tributary side roads, from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads. 66 is the mother road, the road of flight.\\" -- John Steinbeck, The Grapes of WrathI live near Route 66, or what is left of it, in San Bernardino County, the largest county in the continental United States. The great highway which used to connect Needles on the Colorado River with San Bernardino is mostly gone now, replaced by strip malls and freeways. But a few reminders remain. The Tee-Pee Motel on Foothill Boulevard .... Little concrete tee-pee rooms with barred windows against the meth-heads and gangbangers. There are still hamburger stands and greasy spoon diners, and signs memorializing Route 66's place in the history of the West. Etched into the mountains behind the old road is The Arrowhead: a geological anomaly which was revered by the Indians and now is the symbol of the region.Once a year, San Bernardino... where 50% of the population is on public assistance of some kind, and which has the highest proportion of parolees in California... holds a \\"Route 66\\" festival to commemorate the muscle cars that made the region famous in the 50's and 60's. It is the only sign of life in a moribund community.It's difficult now, 70 or 80 years later, to understand the desperation of the Okies in the face of the dustbowls and their obsession to reach California. And there is irony in that California...the Land of Gold and dreams ... is now mired in unemployment and debt. Its budget is $ 42 billion in the red, its once awesome aerospace industry virtually nonexistent, its highways impassable, and its once world-class educational system a disaster. The Okies have been replaced by illegal migrants who still work for less than legal minimum wage, lack health care, and face deportation or worse. In a larger sense, the US is as close to depression as it has been at any time since the 1930's.John Steinbeck's epic depiction of the Joad's journey to California ranks among the best American fiction and social history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Grapes of Wrath may look daunting at first but it, like most Steinbeck, is very easy reading and well worth the read. The book is one of the major landmarks of American Literature and has permeated our entire culture and served as the voice of those striving to move west during the Dust Bowl and, even more so, the American spirit. Preacher Casey and Tom Joad have become classic characters and have even been the subject of many songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen.When you're reading this you're a piece of American history at its finest and most tragic. Steinbeck paints a wonderful picture of the human condition against the back drop of one of the most interesting, exciting, yet tragic times of American history. If you're looking for a long, easy read pick Grapes of Wrath over Harry Potter and you'll certainly get your reward at the end."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I write this review from the perspective of a union-side labor attorney. Prior to reading this novel, I only knew that the subject of the novel was a group of &quot;Okies&quot; (dust-bowl farmers from Oklahoma) and their struggle to survive the Great Depression. However, that is just the protagonists' starting point. From these origins, the Joad family is evicted from their nearly worthless farmland and are forced to travel westward to California. California to the Joad family--and thousands of families like them--is a promised land of milk and honey. As they continue to travel and ultimately arrive in California, they discover it is anything but a promised land.And here is where Steinbeck's utter rage shines through. The Joad family (and thousands of families like theirs) travels to California because they have seen flyers proclaiming the need for grape pickers, peach pickers, cotton pickers, etc. The flyer states that 500 pickers are needed. In reality, only 250 pickers are needed. Additionally, the printers of these flyers (the greedy farm corporations, replacing the individual farmers) distribute these flyers to far more than 500 people. Thousands and thousands of people receive the flyers, creating the farm corporations' dream come true--a glut of starving workers fighting for any job they can get.Therefore, the starving workers undercut each other. While one worker says he will work for $.25 per day, the other worker who is hungrier says that if he gets the job, he will only require $.20 per day. The vicious cycle continues. The rich get richer, and the workers starve. And the outbidding is really the best time of the year--in the winter, there is no work and hence no bidding or money. Whenever anyone talks about organizing the workforce, he is labeled a &quot;red&quot; and either put on a blacklist or killed on the spot.This book is really a rallying cry for the necessity of unions. There are people who now say that unions have served their purpose and are no longer necessary. To that, I must respond that those people do not really understand the watchdog effect of unions.It seems that people remember &quot;The Jungle&quot; as more of a tribute to unions than &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I have read &quot;The Jungle&quot; also, and while I think it is a great book and a very important one, it lacks the literary finesse of Steinbeck. Both books are stories of rage, but Steinbeck's prose is beautiful, haunting, both mournful and intensely angry. As he writes an indictment of the farming corporations, he also writes a love song to America, highlighting the beauty of its land and the bravery and kindness of its people. The Joad family is overwhelmingly good even in the face of one of the cruelest chapters of American history. The last paragraph of the novel both breaks your heart and renews your faith in humanity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it certainly is the most American. John Steinbeck shows us the same place every time, but it's a place worth going to, where the hills roll dustily to infinity and the horses run free; where there are men who will never stop &quot;westering&quot;; where men are MEN--something that seems more than a little obvious, but when you compare Steinbeck with other authors you realize it just isn't so. The book centers on one of the most unjust, trying, disgusting (call it what you will) times in America, and by the end you ARE one of the heroes, one of the simple men, one of the hardy westerers who only have each other and know it, but also know that that's all they need. The book is, if anything, far more necessary now, for Steinbeck's breed of men have faded from our America, and only a book like the Grapes of Wrath could ever bring them back.

I am shocked by some of the negative Amazon reviews. It appears that some of those writing have no concept about the ideas presented in this novel or are in denial about American history. But getting back to this book: read it slowly, linger over Tom and Ma and Rose of Sharon and their sorrows, their daily sacrifices. There is nothing boring here but you will be challenged as to your religious and political stances. The Joads are America itself.

Thus they have to read it fast and they don't get as much out of it. I did not. I chose to read this book, partly because I had heard more good than bad about it, partly because though it was in the 50's, my dad took route 66 from Missouri to California, but the main reaso I read The Grapes of Wrath is because after I got out of High School I wanted to read Literature finally at my own pace, and mainly read the books I never did in school.I dont think I would have liked this book had I had to read it in school because it is 600+ pages but I tell you this. The Grapes of Wrath is the best book I've ever read, and Steinbeck is far up if not the best American author of all time. This book can be compared to Huck Finn. Poor folk, some in trouble with the law make an odessy to a new place, far away. The thing that separates the Steinbeck from Twain is that in this book there were chapters, almost every other one, that didn't pertain to the Joads. They were more an generalized vignette of expiriences that happened to many families who made this journey. May it be lack of food and water on the road or the dustbowl storms destroying a corn crop.Steinbeck weaves characters like a master and Tom Joad's final speech will live on in my mind forever: &quot;Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up some guy, I'll be there.... An when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build-why, I'll be there.&quot;In short, this book is fantastic, one of the best and a must read for anyone.

Well, the action part may be true (depends on what you consider to be &quot;action&quot;), but the boring part is definitely not the case. I literally couldn't put this book down. In a nutshell, it tells the story of a depression era family that is driven from their family farm and describes the hopefullnes and heartache that entails their journey across the country to California in search for work. I realized the degree of struggle of which we today do not, and could not, understand, yet it was so real to those living just a couple of generations earlier. If you stick with this book and give it a chance it will definitely prove to make you think.

So begins what has to be the saddest road-novel of all times. The Joads jump up into a waste of a car and start traveling to California, looking for the chance to get jobs in the prosperous citrics-growing trade. In the road they will suffer all kinds of setbacks and humiliations, until the terribly beautiful, meaningful and symbolic end. Several characters will leave you indelible impressions: Tom Joad himself, a simple but brave man; JC (get your conclusions about his symbolism), the appearing and disappearing ex-preacher; and, above all at least for me, the mother of the Joads, a lovable, courageuos, indestructible human being, one that makes you want to weep for her while feeling a towering admiration for her dignity.Inserted between chapters are short reflections and background about those times, as well as small asides full of symbolism and literary beauties. Some say that Steinbeck's explanations have been proved distorted: don't let that interfere with what is a work of fiction. Such things have happened throughout human history, and what this book does is remind us all that we have a debt to our fellow men (and women, of course).An epic of the eternal fight against indignity and misery, it deserves its fame and prestige."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"With over 300 other reviews listed here, I don't have much to add, except to echo what others have already said: 'The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most powerful novels you will ever read, American or otherwise. As you journey from Oklahoma to California with the Joad Family, you'll experience the same obstacles and emotions they experienced: hunger, pain, separation of family, deplorable living and working conditions, tears, laughter, life, death. But this book is so much more. Whether or not you agree with his political views, no one can deny that Steinbeck was a brilliant writer. That brilliance is evident in every page of this novel.

It was a good novel about the struggles of life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book has stood the test of time and remains an American classic. Throughout the book, Steinbeck gives us an intimate insider's view of the Joad family by providing a narration and dialogue with an incredibly fine level of detail. The description of the poverty and difficulties of the Joads is so vivid that I couldn't help but feel for the human condition back then. To be poor is one thing, but to live without knowing where your next meal is coming from is quite another.The most vivid passage for me is in Ch. 28, when the Joads have been working on the cotton farm for a while and Ma Joad has accumulated enough money to finally go on a &quot;spending spree&quot; at the market. She probably didn't have more than a few dollars, yet when she buys enough food for the whole family, I actually felt a sense of relief, for it seemed they were as rich as kings.To me there are two resounding themes present in this novel. First of course is the strength of the family in the face of adversity. &quot;Family&quot; means more than blood ties; it means people who have shared your suffering and will lend a recipricol hand when needed. This relationship also means that walls will be built to keep some out: note how Tom quickly brushes off the one-eyed mechanic who hopes to come along on the trip. The second theme for me is the yearning for labour, &quot;muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need -- this is man.&quot; We still see this today in America: a need to work for something beyond just money, it is a need to be productive and busy, to surpass our parents, and to produce successful offspring.A final note about this Penguin edition: It evidently reproduces the original typesetting from 1939, so it quite long at 619 pages. However, don't be put off by the length. The font is large, and the interline space is relatively wide. This book could easily be around 100 pages less with a more modern typesetting."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they's somepin worse'n the devil got hold a country, an it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.\\"Grapes Of Wrath is the story of the desperate battle of migrant labourers with the rich, greedy, malevolent and the mean. When the Joads arrive in California from their native Oklahoma, their troubles and tribulations are rewarded not by bounty, but by even more hardship. What ensues is a timeless battle. It is waged by the spirit of the downtrodden on the one side, and by the mercenary mean muscle of the other. The story is primordial and resonates with any reader with a sense for perception.The classic work of fiction describes a world where the rich, with their glitzy cars, ride alone and never mind hitting a man or a noble dog should one come in their way. Then there is the poor and oppressed who, despite their condition, extend a hand time and time again and never forget what is important on the great round dustbowl. The wheel in the sky seems to work against those who toil and possess a heart, but cruelty and oppression are exposed as mere facades that once removed reveal nothing more than a faceless corporate entity bereft of the right to exist.It is in this setting that John Steinbeck writes in amazingly authentic and sanguine dialogue the flight of the strong-at-heart from, and again into, the belly of a system bent on browbeating compassion, kindness and veracity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an American classic which, though showing its age, says much to the America of today.A masterful story teller, Steinbeck unfolds the story of the Joads, a family of dispossessed Okies, set adrift in a sea which they do not know, by forces which they do not understand. As we watch them lose their farm, travel with them in the truck to California, then search with them for work in their new world, we begin to appreciate the life of a penniless migrant of the Dust Bowl Era.As enthralling as this story is, it is periodically interrupted by chapters of social commentary. Nobody seized the land, it was the bank. No one set the wages, the growers association did. There is no personal responsibility. The little people are crushed by impersonal organizations.The theme of class struggle runs deeply, but is seems a bit dated. When Steinbeck wrote, the Joads probably seems to be part of a struggle driven by deliberate decisions made by people who were willing to ruin the lives of little people for profit, all the while hiding behind the claim that their actions were compelled by impersonal forces.It seems that, to Steinbeck, the struggle over land was one in which \\"The People\\" could determine the outcome. Knowing what we now know, the mechanization of agriculture set in motion forces which inexorably reduced demand for agricultural labor. The prosperity which the world enjoys today is incompatible with world the Joads knew in Oklahoma. The Tom Joads reaped the Grapes of Wrath, but many of their grandchildren eat from the Horn of Plenty. The tragedy is not, as Steinbeck seems to posit, that the Joads lost their land, but that they were unable to successfully adapt to the changing times. They could not adapt but, in their own ways, they did cope.Although the specific struggle of the Okies is passed and many of their grandchildren have achieved prosperity in the mainstream economy, their problem remains. There are still economically marginal people unable to adapt to the changing times, people who have to cope in their own ways. They too, have a spokesman in John Steinbeck.This book is powerful. It is moving. Come, ride into yesteryear."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Grapes of Wrath is a very different book I have read from many others. I'm a high schooler, and I usually read cheesy romantics and books for teens, so it took me a long time to get into this book. It starts out slow, (actually very slow) and it kind of gets repetitve in the sense of that they're in the great depression, they're tired, hungry, and they want to get a job. Then you get into two thirds of the book, where they live in a nice camp with actual toliets that flush, hot showers, etc. and it all starts to come from there. The hardships the Joads family has to make, and how Ma is more like the dad of the house, and keeps everyone going and under control.The ending was very... different. It just sort of ended, just like to Kill a Mockingbird.This is probably one of my top ten books, and just like other classics, it takes a while to get into."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath just out of interest when I saw it sitting on a bookstore shelf, it wasn't part of my school ciriculum or anything of the sort. I found it was not really entertaining and at times it's not really a page turner, but you will want to read till the end to see what happens.The problem I have with GoW is that it repeats the same monotonous message over and over again. The same lesson, the same insight, the same issue. While this may be effective in driving home to the reader the fact that the migrant situation during the depression had a far reaching and catastrophic impact on certain americans and the segregation there was in the community, I just wish I didn't need to know the same details constantly.Steinbeck did do a great job of creating a wonderfully written (sometimes poetic, especially inbetween chapters) story with wonderful characters but I do see areas where there could have been improvement. There is little description in a characters actions or movements. While you may feel what the character is going through, it can be a little more difficult to 'see' whats going on as Steinbeck was sparse with descriptions. If that's his writing style then so be it, I didn't really like that about the novel.GoW throws the reader through problem after problem, with only the strength of will of Tom and his mother keeping the family glued together, you do feel the injustice and hardships that they experienced, and the vain hope that they can obtain a piece of land.The ending is a bit of a mystery to me, I can't quite catch the metaphor in the last scene but I do see how it works overall. Anyway, if you are interested in tasting a bit of classic work, read GoW. You'll come away satisfied."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck is a wonderful writer and extremely thoughtful in writing this book. he incorporates several different aspects and allusions including biblical ones, marx, emerson into the book without making the story heavy or boring. there are many different symbols, ideas, and themes of steinbeck in this book and one cannot help but appreciate how much work steinbeck has put into it, and how he intertwines it all in a perfect ending. steinbeck uses interchapters between plot chapters to explain symbolism and key ideas. he also has a great style and is quite a literary genius."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Steinbeck's simple but poetic prose shows a mastery of subtlety and expertise. The dialog was very believable and realistic. The period in which J. Steinbeck wrote as did Hemingway was the realism movement, which never really strayed too long into what the characters were thinking or feeling. The characters words on the surface is what portrayed who they were and Steinbeck expertly reveals all of them, even down to his tertiary characters, Ruthie and Winfield. Ma Joad and Tom are beautifully realized as was Casey the former preacher.If I have any quibble with the story, it's some of the chapters, which were a little too polemical and didactic. I felt Steinbeck trying too hard to drive his personal beliefs down my throat about \\"The Man versus the corporation and big business.\\" Overall however, I still came away with great admiration for what he tried to accomplish with this story, considering we had just come out of the Depression only about five or six years later followed by the destructive Dust Bowls, created by man.I now understand why this novel is considered in such high esteem by so many experts and admirers of fiction. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly one of the great American novels!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I only actually have to read this book as a Summer Reading assignment for my AP English class.

The question he posed is how can the economical factors help with the sociological situation. It has got to be more than a 'bottom line' philosophy.

There are many parallels in the novel's plot to what is occurring in our economy today. There are differences, too, and they are poignant: the strong family bond, the lack of governmental aid to the poor, and how they lived, from their cars to their houses both simplifies and complicates the Joad's journey to California and they hope, stability for their family. Anyone who has driven along Route 66 or the Texas panhandle, for instance, can really appreciate Steinback's intense description of the Joad's journey to California and just how nerve-wracking it must have been without the benefit of a good car, motels, bottled water, and credit cards.For those who might complain that the narrative intermingled with the Joad's story is too lefty or smacks of propaganda, I think it adds a good balance to the story. It gives you a sense of the anger and sadness building among nameless people as their lives fall apart, while the Joads give a name and a face to the suffering. And again, I think it is pretty on par with what is going on today: a universal feeling of helpfulness that really hasn't found a purpose, plan, or footing among private struggles of individuals.Long story short: Grapes of Wrath is a really good novel. And anytime I read a book where there is a moment when I actually have to put the book down because it is too painful to go on, I can't help but love the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It arrived in new condition.

John Steinbeck expertly tells the story of the Joad Family. The way Steinbeck wrote of the Joads' struggles was entertaining and informative. This novel was somewhat depressing, however, because of how real it was. Families moved to find work during the Great Depression and found themselves struggling to find work, just like the Joad family. A quote I found very interesting, \\"For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments,\\" shows the significance of growing from experiences.

After I recieved a C- on my book write-up, I was deeply saddened because I had worked very hard to understand the themes of struggle, love, and hope. Even though I recieved that C-, I feel I have learned a lot about human life and struggle from the simple plot of The Grapes of Wrath. This book is full of everything that makes a book a classic. I recommended to everyone of all ages even a person is too young to understand the symbolism and the allegorical themes.

Great book!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It is not hard to see why this novel is still selling and still largely read by America. If you have never been unemployed or underpayed you simply will not understand the life of the Joad family in search of their part of the &quot;American dream.&quot; Steinbeck's timeless adaptation of unemployed and displaced America shows the sagas and differences with the endless problems between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot; and the working class American looking for what is rightfully his; dignity. This struggle did not begin with this novel not did it end with this novel but Steinbeck did his part in showing the struggles of those leaving their homes to find a way to keep their family together. If you read this novel and are not touched by the strength of a great woman doing everything she can to keep her family together then it nothing more than a book. If you look deep into the metaphor of what life really is like for the working class then you can take with you what Steinbeck intended. Life is hard. Steinbeck was one up on women's liberation.

I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. On the other hand, years of personal life experience helped me to truly appreciate a book of this nature. It earned Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and I think it's well worth it.The story follows the plight of the dirt-poor Oklahoman sharecroppers who became victims of the great draught of the 1930's. The land literally dried up, turned to dust and blew way, so the banks and the landowners had no other choice but to expel the sharecroppers from their farms. Just like that, their services were no longer needed. The sharecroppers, in turn, were lured to California by a rain of colorful flyers depicting California as the land of opportunity with plenty of well-paying jobs and the chance for a brand new life. All they had to do was get there. So hundreds of thousands of displaced workers packed their eager belongings and headed west.The perspective of the story is from the Joad family's point of view. They were a typical poor family who managed to fix up their old truck with sweat and bailing wire and put together just enough cash money to make the long trip to the agricultural heartland of California. But, of course, something went wrong. Not one thing, but a series of misfortunes. And in my opinion, John Steinbeck did a brilliant job of writing a story that immerses you deep into the heart of the action, as if we, the readers, were sitting in that old broken down truck right alongside the Joad family, breathing the air they breathed, eating the food the ate, feeling their pain, and experiencing everything they experienced. And life on the road to California was tough beyond imagination.By some miracle, the Joad family eventually made it to California. But it wasn't exactly like the flyers had depicted it would be. It seems that the California farmers and landowners had send out thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs. If a farmer needed five hundred workers, he'd send out twenty thousand flyers. This tactic resulted in an all-out hunger panic, and forced thousands upon thousands of starving migrants to compete for a relatively few jobs. Thus, wages were negotiated lower and lower until it wasn't even enough money to feed a family. For instance, a man with a wife and children would gladly work for less than a man with no family. And the women broke their backs and worked their own fingers to the bone tending to their impoverished families, oftentimes feeding them nothing more than hot gravy made from a splash lard and flour. So the migrants basically found themselves in the same shape they were in before they left their homes in Oklahoma. They had no money, no food and no gas to go elsewhere. And on top of that, the locals didn't want them near their towns, houses, stores or children for fear of being overrun by thieves. So the police constantly harassed them, shot at them, threw them in jail, and drove them off the property and back onto the open road. Poor, starving, and marooned in a strange land, for the Joad family, as well as the thousands of other migrant families, California proved to be anything but the land of opportunity.John Steinbeck wasn't a writer known for using big bang endings, but to me, the ending of this book was exceptional and, in my opinion, can only be truly understood after you have read the entire book. You'll have to judge for yourself. I give Grapes of Wrath my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The crime and the sorrow that the subject sentences refer to was aptly characterized by Steinbeck in a previous paragraph: \\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten.\\" I first read those words some 40 years ago, have carried them with me, along with the intervening image that Steinbeck described, that of hungry people not being able to eat the oranges that had been dumped, and squirted with kerosene in order to destroy them, essentially because the \\"market\\" demanded it. The hunger that Steinbeck described in America has been attenuated, but not eliminated over the years, and there is still a vast operation here in ABQ, involving thousands of volunteers, to \\"feed the hungry.\\" I live only four miles from the old Route 66, and each day one can still witness America's \\"lumpenproletariat,\\" although they would certainly never use that word, wandering up and down the street, on their way to California, where their life will be different, or returning, after it proved not to be.With the \\"new hard times\\" upon us, and \\"the market\\" has again proven to be \\"a god that failed,\\" I thought Steinbeck's book worthy of a re-read. It has lost none of its power over the intervening years; unfortunately the issues described resonate today. Only a few days ago there was a picture in the NYT of new homes being demolished in Victorville, CA, again, because \\"the market\\" demanded it.Steinbeck is a master storyteller. The epic of \\"those dustbowl days,\\" when large swaths of American farmers in the Mid-West were driven off their land, and turned into migrants, is told in microcosm, personified by the Joad family, trying to stay together in adversity, with the centrifugal forces pulling them apart. Ma Joad, in particular, is a stoic, heroic figure. And Tom was famously played by a young Henry Fonda in the movie. Steinbeck alternates these chapters with short, pithy descriptive chapters of the macrocosm, the overall social and economic forces that produced this tragedy. Steinbeck is a master of dialogue, capturing the rural patois of the heartland. His characterization of the members of the Joad family, and people they meet along \\"the mother road,\\" Rt. 66 is likewise strong. There are some charming vignettes, like the waitress in the diner, dealing with the nasty, economically affluent, and the kindness of truck drivers, the \\"knights of the road.\\" Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for this book; modestly he claimed he did not deserve it, but no other book has so successfully captured the anguish of that era.Lessons for today abound: \\"And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away.\\" (p324). It didn't really work out that way. World War II was to finally provide the \\"meaningful employment\\" that ended the depression, and dealt with the issue of surplus production far more dramatically that kerosene on oranges. Essentially nothing has changed, save for the more global dimension of the issue, since Steinbeck wrote: \\"And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling.\\" (p388)Later in life Steinbeck seemed to have forgotten: \\"...and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights\\" (p 386). Steinbeck supported the Vietnam War!I was surprised and sadden by the number of 1-star reviews, mainly by high school students, \\"forced\\" to read the book, \\"irrelevant ancient history\\" that they might start re-living. One even said that Steinbeck was a communist, apparently not having read: \\"A red is any SOB that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five\\"! (p 407). Unlike some books that I had to read in high school, it is a good, solid, easy-to-read book. Alas, many of these students will become adults, who never read a book again, though they might now have the time standing in the unemployment lines.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was excellent the first time around, and equally so, and even more relevant today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I love this book for a variety of reasons, and I'll share these before offering my criticisms:1) Wonderful tale of a painful time and place in American history2) Great characters - and powerful bonding between them. I loved their ability to sacrifice for each other - at great costs.3) A metaphorically redemptive message: this book shows the strength of human perseverance in the face of awful odds4) Incredible local color - accents, speech, behavior! John Steinbeck really knew his stuff, and brought it to LIFE! Kudos!5) Beautiful writing - so many times Steinbeck wrote scenes that sing off the page, transcending the story, the characters, and himself6) I just love Steinbeck's character of Preacher Casy. He adds such a strong dimension of honesty, emotional courage, and truth-seeking to the book... He's one of my favorite characters in all of literature.My criticisms:1) Having previously read this book fifteen years ago, I learned then that the \\"filler\\" chapters - the ones NOT about the Joad family - were unnecessary to the story, so I skipped them this time around. This made the book infinitely more readable and enjoyable. I would guess these skippable chapters account for about a third of the book's volume...2) I found the ending cheesy - didn't like it fifteen years ago, and still don't. I won't go into details (don't want to be a spoiler), but I found it too intellectual and emotionally disconnected to the pulse of the story...3) Steinbeck uses various of his characters (particularly Preacher Casy) to make all sorts of philosophical comments on life, but never does he state the obvious, much less come near it with a ten-foot pole: DON'T HAVE SO MANY KIDS! The whole book is about people trying desperately to feed their children - for whom they cannot provide. To me this leaves the parents - sharecroppers, who, at the best of times, had life REALLY hard - and not just society, responsible. Even ONE little comment to this effect would have been welcomed. Yet has anything changed since the 1930s? Does anyone suggest that starving adults in Darfur not have children?

This man spends an entire chapter on describing the movements of a turtle. Not a joke. A far more intereasting story then this one would probably be the man the main character supposingly killed, but even that would suck. Steinbeck would write it something like this:\\"And after seeing the corpse falled, he cried. He cried like he had never cried before, tears streaming down his face endlessly. Rivers of water flowed out from his eyes, drowning bacteria and skin pores alike. The tears tasted salty; like ramen. But he couldn't help it.His father had worked the land. His grandfather had worked the land. He had been born here, he had lived here, he would have wanted to die here. The land was like his lifeblood, flowing through him. Goddam bank people taking the land. The land! His forefathers had lived on this land!

Steinbeck couldn't even devise a plot, aside from the weary, disconnected journey of a destitute family.Aside from its nauseating politics, the entire novel is filled with filthy characters doing nothing in particular save a near-constant whining about their sorry &quot;fate.&quot; And the end is so unspeakably stomach-turning that any virtues _Grapes_ might have had are dashed for a cheap gross-out.Save your minds and stomachs.

The chapters describing the family where extremely slow moving, with dialogue and descriptions that would go on for pages, but which did not have any real point in the context of the story, and, perhaps more importantly given one of the main purposes of this novel, was not necessary to give the reader a \\"feel\\" of the times. This overabundance of irrelevent information detracts from the story, in that it makes it difficult for the reader to fully submerse his-/herself in the story and, in the end, obscures the portrait of America at this time, as the reader is given so many details, that they begin to run over each other. Essentially it is a portrait that is completely lacking a frame, and this lack of a frame- or a context for all of the details, leads to a very confused image and story.I did not loathe the entire book, and even enjoyed some of the intermediate chapters describing the country as a whole (I particularly liked the one about the used car dealership), as I felt that these were well written, and the most concise. Furthermore, the symbolism was rather good, but again, overdone, as was Steinbeck's use of naturalism.However, the main plot line, the Joads' migration, was overly convuluted and, after the umptenth tragic mishap, left me utterly apathetic to the fate of the family or their plight, especially since there seemed to be a tendency to \\"kill off\\" or otherwise subject the characters to tragic fates before they had been developed to the point that I actually cared what happened to them-- that they became more than just characters in a book (with the sole exception of Casey). When I reached the end of the book, I found myself asking-- \\"what was the point?\\" Steinbeck dragged this family through the depths of hell, and yet it was done in such a clinical fashion that it lacked the human and emotional essence needed to make it be for a point, or even just that no one should have to suffer so pointlessly. One acknowledges that (hopefully) already on a logical level, but this book failed to invest it with any kind of emotional level, despite the seven page conversations. Having read \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" I know that Steinbeck can do better. I was decidedly NOT apathetic to the fate of Lennie and George. Even with allowances made for the different purposes of the stories, I cannot give a great deal of credit to a story seems pointless (except maybe post-modernism :-)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"ok so im a teenager so my thoughts are probably a little different than adults out there.

Unfortunately, the thing will take you about three years to read due to it's excessively boring, uneventful passages and, unless you're Jeff Foxworthy, impossible to decipher Southern dialect. So the Joads go from job to job, making a nickel a day. And then they lose their jobs and go to another job. This continues for the first 400 pages. Finally,if you are able to survive that ordeal, you reach the final ten pages, waiting for the killer, \\"Boo Radley is a nice guy\\"-esque ending. Nothing. In the end, they are still poor and desperate. I suppose that in its time this book was a revelation of sorts, exposing the pathetic conditions in which the average man toiled in during the Great Depression. Now? It's an easy cure for any insomniac, as it will bore you to death with its monotony. Classic, schmassic.

Rather, he is an author who knows how to pick his topic and manipulate his readers. As in his other well known novels/novellas such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", Steinbeck had again chosen a innocent good (the Okies) struggling against a unlimited evil (the California captalists). To give credit where credit is due, Steinbeck indeed does potray the hardships of the dustbowl sharecroppers vividly and at the same time, tells us of the awsome collective powers of humanity and society via Jim Casy. Unfortunately, the literary value of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" ends up just about there. As Steinbeck repeatedly stresses the Joad Family's mistreatment, he does not explain nor justify why the so called \\"big greedy captalist\\" exploit the \\"impoverished sharecroppers\\". Furthermore, Steinbeck does not offer us a fair resolution, he simply and conviently leaves the readers hanging in the end without new revelations. Think of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", we learn that sometimes the society is filled injustice, however, in the end, all people, white or black, rich or poor are inherently good. Sadly, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" fails to transcend its melodramatics. In essence, like a teenager's unwarranted complaint against his or her \\"phony\\" society which cannot be called literature, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" does not deserve the label \\"a great American novel\\"."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Words cannot express my hatred for this book. If Amazon allowed it, this book would get a -10 star rating. If I could find every copy of this book I'd bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor, gather the residue, and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy. If I had a functional time machine, I'd seriously consider making sure this book never was created.Somehow, John Steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author \\"voice\\" that drips with unparalleled condescention. I consider The Grapes of Wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsupecting students by brain-dead literati who call it Literture---most likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats.My grandparents were very much like Okies from the depression era. They came from the Missouri Ozarks, got married in 1933 and raised 11 children. During this era, my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm, mostly shoveling pig manure. Obviously, my grandparents were very culturally similar to the Okies Steinbeck attempted to portray in this \\"novel\\". I find The Grapes of Wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy.The reason why is that The Grapes of Wrath uses symbols and referrents that were completely alien to their world view. In no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like Steinbeck does. Of course, Steinbeck doesn't care. He's too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens. Instead, he transmorgifies their world view into something palatable to self-indentified intelligensia based in university English departments. Of course, their experience, expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldn't be sophisticated enough to make their experience \\"valid\\". Oh no. Instead, he needed to create something totally alien to them, and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience.To understand how offensive The Grapes of Wrath is, it's as if someone tried to write a novelization of \\"Boy'z 'n the Hood\\" using symbols and cultural referrants typical among members of Augusta National Golf Club, using dialog with ghetto slang as rendered into dialect by a white man who spent his life in exclusive clubs, then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of American urban experience. The Grapes of Wrath is a 169,481 word definition of Noblesse Oblige.In short, Steinbeck is saying we can't care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand (while validating their self-proclaimed intellectual superiority).No passage demonstrates Steinbeck's psuedo-intellectual posing more than the scene of the turtle crossing the highway. Steinbeck tries to import evolutionary concepts into his work; but, he so thoroughly botches the attempt he shows his utter ignorance of evolutionary theory rather than the erudition he wishes to display. This passage clearly depends on something known as group selection theory; a theory that is, at best, a very weak force in evolution. Group selection was blown out of the water by altruistic gene theory. To be fair to Steinbeck, altruistic gene theory didn't appear in biological journals until the 50's (well after Wrath's 1939 pub date)---even so, anyone with a sound grasp of Darwin's Origin of the Species can see that Darwin himself understood the basics of altruistic gene theory. Thus, a truly knowledgable individual would have known group selection was an unsound basis for literary symbolism.I do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme, probably driven by being forced to read it 3 times during my education AND WRITE PAPERS ON IT. Reading it was bad enough. Having to write three papers on The Grapes of Wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to put pen to paper for the rest of their life. I so hated this book that I found myself wanting the California farmers to grind the Okies into dust so that the horrible thing would end and I could stop reading it. Or, perhaps, that the entire Joad family would get mowed down by a Zephyr hurtling down the highway so they'd be put out of their misery. Unfortunately, Deathrace 2000 wouldn't get made for another 36 years.I wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book (and I recognize that there are many) can understand why legions of students (I would suggest they are a silent majority) hate it (as I did many years ago). I'm trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like \\"you're not mature enough\\" or \\"you're just not capable of understanding\\". I thoroughly understand Steinbeck's craft, and I despise it.I must admit, however, that part of my implacable hatred is a matter a taste rather than objective reason. I would like to think---were I to find myself in the position of the Okies---I'd find a way to \\"beat the game\\". The Grapes of Wrath offers no character with any hope of such an outcome. Instead, it portrays the \\"no win scenario\\" (to paraphrase the pop-culture Star Trek movie \\"The Wrath of Khan\\"); which, sadly, is reality for far too many people in this world. While knowing this situation to be part of human experience, I don't want it in my fiction. And I certainly don't want 169,000 words of it.What makes The Grapes of Wrath even worse is Steinbeck's undeniable literary gifts. The Grapes of Wrath is the artistic equivalent of Pablo Picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying Josef Stalin's treatment of the Ukraine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I liked East of Eden better, although, The Grapes of Wrath is Great History. But, I was under the impression that the Oakies came West in Horse Drawn Buggies because I thought that it had taken place earlier. Of course, I knew that there was a DUST BOWL. But, I didn't realize that the farmers were Sharecroppers that the BANKS had abandoned, so that the Land could be cultivated by MODERN TRACTORS. I thought that the LAND itself had gone BAD. But, that's not True. The farmers in Oklahoma were displaced by AUTOMATION. In fact, the tractors knocked their houses over because they didn't OWN the land.But, it took place less than 100 years ago, so that's Shocking because I thought that the country had a lot more ON THE BALL. In fact, it gave me a Stomach Ache because none of the characters demonstrated (or manifested) the slightest CONTROL over their own Destiny. They followed their Noses. They were just like Lemmings. And the only people that Successfully ESCAPED were Single Men who didn't have any Family to worry about or worry about them (e.g., Connie, Casey, and Tom etc). But, Tom's ma gave him seven bucks so he could escape to Los Angeles because he was on Parole (in Oklahoma) and he had Killed somebody else (a Posse member) that had killed Casey, The preacher and Union Leader, right before his very Eyes (in California). But, Families couldn't ESCAPE. They were Stuck in a RUT. Just like a BLACK HOLE.The FOOD (?) that they Ate was JUNK: nothing but Lard, bacon fat, pork fat, and absolutely NO VEGETABLES (except for an onion once). They ate Fried Dough (which's nothing but flour fried in lard) everyday. And Meat (Hamburger, Bacon, Pork, and Salt Pork). NO EGGS. Bread and Potatoes occasionally. Some Fruit that they Picked at work. They had Coffee with some sugar. Biscuits with pork gravy was their main faire. I'd barf!!! They lived on GREASE that they should've Thrown AWAY. Therefore, they probably suffered from LEARNED HELPLESSNESS as well as chronic MALNUTRITION because they worked just for FOOD which was practically GARBAGE.But, the government Camp (in California) had HOT water and Toilets, so they were clean for the First Time in their entire lives, but they had to leave there soon because they ran out of money, even though they managed to survive the RIOT that the Sheriff had instigated at the Dance. In fact, Tom, nipped it at the bud. Too bad the government Camp didn't attempt to provide everyone with FREE FOOD. Perhaps, some of the Women could've cultivated some of that Excess Land to grow Vegetables for everyone in the Camp. That's what I would've suggested.If I had to live like that, I'd probably MOVE BACK TO EUROPE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"There are few early 20th century books that are more self-important, ponderous, self-indulgent, and overexposed than John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Ostensibly a novel that is intended to highlight the labor injustice in the California agriculture industry experienced by Dust Bowl migrants of the 1930's, the reader quickly finds that the gaunt frame of this plot is heavily draped with endless similes, metaphors, and other descriptive machinations that merely serve to bore even the most persistent. Chapter after chapter Steinbeck's words ponderously crawl across the pages on their hands and knees, begging the reader to flip forward a few pages just to relieve the monotony. It is sure to delight every English literature college professor and fill Steinbeck devotees with self-righteous pleasure and an endless supply of meaningless excerpts to be pressed on unsuspecting but appreciatively nodding folks at the specialty bookstores in Hyannis Port and Berkeley. But for most readers, Grapes of Wrath is an unrewarding chore.Given the novel's pretensions it is no surprise that in the intervening decades legions of harried college freshmen and gawky high school students have been required to read, and lord help us all, interpret the words of Steinbeck in Grapes of Wrath until no remaining literary stone is unturned and whole forests of trees are cut down to feed the maws of the paper mills that produce the neatly ruled blue notebooks favored by professors and teachers for book reports and final exams. This constant exposure and the endless self-reinforcing literary acclaim in the seventy odd years since the publishing of the novel might lead the unsuspecting reader to consider taking it on as thoughtful grist for the mental mill. Let this review serve as warning label that should be on the back cover. There are hundreds of thousands of works written in the century before, during, and after that will better serve to both entertain and provoke the critical thinking the reader is looking for.Yes, Steinbeck was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath, a dubious distinction if there was ever one. Pulitzers are liberally handed out to the newsprint literati for purportedly socially meaningful articles and books that uplift the oppressed and cast down the powerful. So it is no surprise the Grapes of Wrath was so recognized for shining a light on exploitative corporate farming interests and the conditions endured by many in the horrid years of the Great Depression. Throw into the mix the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl and one has a sure fire formula guaranteed to please hard-to-please snarky book reviewers. Is the book a good read? Heck no, but that is hardly the point.Steinbeck, this reviewer is sure, meant to ape Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862) when he wrote the Grapes of Wrath. It is telling that even the English translation of Les Miserables towers over Steinbeck's novel in terms of depth and readability, no mean feat when one considers that the French novel was excoriated by reviewers of that era as overly sentimental socialist tripe. Grapes of Wrath continues to be a tempting resource for classroom assignments, particularly given its message of class struggle, social justice, and the neat ability to refer glowingly to FDR's social engineering conducted in his first two terms in office. Unfortunately this focus is in spite of the fact that the style of writing is tortured and archaic, that most plot elements have not aged well over the years, and that none of the main characters are overly interesting. These drawbacks are real achievements given the continuing relevance of questionable modern agricultural practices and illegal immigrant migrants in the 21st century.In terms of early to mid-20th century social relevance one could do better with The Jungle (1906, Upton Sinclair) or 1984 (1949, George Orwell). In the same era, but for literary visualizations, the reader is much better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury). And just about anything off of the Amazon bestseller list would be vastly more entertaining."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath.

And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages.

Like Preacher Casy, I went off and did some thinkin' and then some more thinkin', and here's what I think probably came to pass in the lives of the principal characters:Ma Joad: The trials of migration, familial disintegration, and non-stop tragedy finally break this great lady down. An excess of greasy food causes a massive heart attack. The children, Ruthie and Winfield, returning from gathering firewood, find her dead on the ground near the cooking fire.Tom Joad, Senior: Being displaced as the head of the family wears mightily upon his mind. He catches pneumonia from the exposure to the flood, and dies in the barn two weeks after the original novel ends. He is delusional, and seems to be permanently in the land of shades.Uncle John: Scrapes up enough coin to \\"enjoy\\" one last big drunk. Found floating in the same river as the bundle he was sent to bury.Rose of Sharon: Finds work as a \\"hostess\\" in a bar in Lodi. Sells her favors for a while, then meets and marries a grifter and bunco artist. They travel the west, hanging bad paper, and one day she finds herself alone in a cheap motel. Goes to sleep forever after taking an overdose of something.Winfield: Lies about his age and joins the US Marine Corps in 1940 at the age of 15. Killed in action on Okinawa, 1945. Posthumously awarded a Silver Star.Ruthie: Found wandering near Bakersfield, picked up by a kindly childless family who are moving to Oregon. She lives in a good home surrounded by people who love her. Completes high school and then nursing school in Seattle. Specializes in pediatric nursing because of her love of children. Retires in 1968, dies 1970.Tom Joad, Junior: Caught just one month after last seeing Ma Joad, charged with First Degree Murder. Zealous young \\"leftist\\" public defender J.I. Hurwitz gets the charges reduced to 2nd Degree, but Tom still gets a 25 year sentence, at notorious Folsom Prison. His inflated reputation (by the press) as a \\"red troublemaker\\" and \\"cop killer\\" precede him, and guards make his life miserable. He does a lot of time in solitary, for petty infractions. After six years inside, he is a broken man. Found hanging in his cell, 1943. Foul play suspected but never proved.Al Joad: At last, a \\"success story\\". Many readers have noticed that Al is better adapted to a changing America, with his uncanny knack for fixing cars, coupled with a \\"can-do\\" cockiness. You can't keep a good man down, we all know that. He and Aggie Wainwright hitchhike to L.A., where Al gets a job as a \\"lot boy\\" at a big Chevrolet dealership. War breaks out, and the management finds out Al is a crackerjack mechanic. He quickly rises to be Service Manager, all the time squirreling away money from his day job and his moonlight job, fixing cars and trading in black market tires with fellow Okie Eddie Moon.In 1946 he takes over a down at heel used car dealership on Long Beach Boulevard. He gets the land and stock for free because the former owner owed him money from a deal that went bad. He buys lots of spot ads on local country/western stations, appealing to struggling young people to \\"come on in, yer job is yer credit, we know how it is, we BELIEVE in YOU!\\" Before long he is the owner of most of the used car lots in Long Beach, although leaving in place the former names. In the 50's he becomes a Chrysler/Plymouth dealer, and a constant presence on local TV, sponsoring wrestling matches, music shows, and demolition derbies. An only son, Thomas Winfield Joad, is found dead of a heroin overdose in Hollywood, 1969. Al retires from the car business but becomes a fierce spokesman for the War Against Drugs. He dies, fabulously wealthy, without an heir, in 1975.My apologies to Mr. Steinbeck. I mean no disrespect.

One of these families is the Joads (the collective character of this tale), which \\"in group\\" confront the continuous adversity \\"individualism\\" is offering them every step of the way from the moment they leave Oklahoma until they finally try to settle down in California where they had gone following the indications of a handbill requesting orange pickers and just one unique hope, to find work, but in California things does not seem to be the way it looked, and the battle renews and rages on. Contemporary issues arise, such as immigration, equality, unemployment, egotism, hunger, strikes, law, authority, social demands. The ending leaves a message of hope, related to the will each individual possess in its more intimate and spiritual values. Almost a classic, this novel has been classified among the best written in the 20th century by book critics"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"To summarize the Grapes of wrath is to destroy the book. But This book encompasses feeling, story telling, and symbolism, and incorporates them. The book is set in the beginnings of the great depression, and the travel of the people between oaklahoma, and California, and in particular, the Jode family, (Tom Jode, Ma Jode, Pa Jode, Noah, connie, ruthie, Winfield, Gramdpa and Grandma, Al, Rose of Sharon, and The Preacher Jim Casy). Who travel to California in hopes of having a better life. But durring the journey, Grandma and Grandma Jode die. But after the drive, they run out of money and supplies, and wind up in a camp in California that is bullied on by the corrupt cops, to which they set on fire, and drive everyone out. After a string of bad misfortions, the Jodes wind up in a government camp with crazy people, and still no work, but eventually, they find work picking peaches, and live in a box car, where the story ends with the now not pregnant Rose of Sharon feeding a starving man.The grapes of wrath breaks ground on a lot of levels. Even through my fourth read i feel as though im still picking out new concepts. I suggest this book for study and to read because John Steinbeck is truly a master of story development. I feel that the characters are vividly formed, and his scenes feel real! But the grapes of wrath encompasses an element rarely used on this scale today. Many people see the grapes of wrath as a book that merely is about the Jodes and their journey across America. But to look at this piece of literature from that perspective is to miss the book altogether. The stories theam is far greater than one family. It uses metaphors to express the pain felt in America. In the beginning it makes a bit of mention of a tortoise whose heading towards a single direction. The tortoise is knocked down and forgotten. But it seems to be a metaphors to the solemn perseverance of the American spirit. But this is far from the greatest bit of expression in the book, Steinbeck purposely utilizes characters in the book for hidden meanings. The preacher: Jim Casey. His role as a character is to provide a slightly religious influence to the book. Though Jim Casey is a preacher, he has frustrations with religion. This seems to express some of Stienbeck's views in religion. With the purpose that Jim Casey serves in this book, I believe that it isn't consequence that his initials are J. C. . Another brilliant use of a metaphorical concept falls with rose of sharron. She through out the book held a fairly useless spot. She constantly was a \\"lesser\\" character than most, but stienbeck uses her to illustrate another theme. The book ends with her and a starving man. The starving man cannot eat regular food without getting violently sick. He had no more options for food... Rose of Sharon just experienced her baby dying prematurely before even being born. So she has a source of food ( I found no other way of wording that...) so she feeds the starving man with her unused milk. To me it seems extremely strange that a book of this kind would end with a character as \\"unimportant\\" as this. He used rose of Sharon as a metaphor to how we as people look out for each other furring the hard times. Over all this book is a stellar book to read. It is full of vibrant illustrations, perfectly formed characters, and meaning on a deep level as an American, and as a human on this earth."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A massive work about the migration of dispossessed farmers from Dustbowl Oklahoma to California in the 1930s, the story traces one such family, the Joads, as they seek the Promised Land of oranges and cotton, only to realise the truth isn't so simple, and the destination as arduous as the journey.Criticised for its less than in-depth psychological analysis of the characters like Tom Joad and ex-preacher Jim Casey, I however felt that the cinematic vision of the text came through because of the way characters are revealed through what they say and do. Ma Joad, in particular, struck me as an unwaveringly strong character who tries to hold her family together, even as it disintegrates before her eyes.In the interchapters, Steinbeck casts his lens on the larger situation and suffering of these migrants, and makes a sobering social commentary on the state of America and its politics of commerce and capitalism. Some readers have commented on the oppressive view that Steinbeck forces on the reader, but that to me is secondary, because the narrative persuades through both the examination of the micro as well as the macro, and it is a point of view that demands careful gaze."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a 5th generation born and bred Sooner, this novel resonated deep in my soul. It isn't pretty or heart-warming, but rather a (gritty) honest look at the desperation and hardships poor folks faced during the dust bowl era.

Writing does not get any better than this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A brilliant look at the Great Depression and how it effected people. Steinbeck was one of the great American writers and this was likely his most important work. The book will educate you and also make you feel for the characters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is so profound, so moving and so forever a source of debate and controversy that one may forget that it is first a great story. It gives voice to a people suffering badly and it portrays them as they surely would like to be seen - as honorable decent people trying to make their way against the forces of nature, man and economics. John Steinbeck masterfully interweaves the struggling of one family into the great calamity of the dust bowl that brought out the worst in some people and best in others as millions deal with poverty and dislocation.You could argue that he idealized the virtuous indigent and vilified the wealthy as cruel and callous but much of what he wrote came of direct observation and much of what occurred in fiction happened in fact. When the pie from which we all feed from shrinks the fight for what remains is dirty and there's a tendency for the empowered to leave the rest behind regardless of legitimacy.The Joad family have lost their farm in Oklahoma and they are joining the great migration to California and the promise of jobs and opportunity. They are a healthy close-knit family that care and look out for each other. The strain of homelessness and uncertainty pays a heavy price which is at the root of the book's story. It would be a hard man not to feel empathy for them and the millions like them. Steinbeck wrote the book in 1938-39. He is staring right into the abyss of the Depression. You can feel the immediacy still. His writing is beautiful as his characters take life and the scenes are clear.When you read one of the most famous books in American literature do you try to ignore the hype and just read the book? There is so much going on here. Is he arguing for bigger government? Is he anti-capitalist or perhaps supporting communism? My conclusion is he saying \\"look - people are suffering. We Americans have a collective responsibility to each other.\\" I did not see this as philosophy or a soapbox polemic against anything other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing. I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to them"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Some politicians and economists tell us the 'recession' is over, but it sure doesn't look like it to most Americans. In fact, when you see friends and others out of work or losing their homes it looks a LOT more like a 'Depression'. A recent article in the LA Times pointed out that what we *don't* yet see coming out of the hard times this time around is great art - it seems the movie makers and musicians are too far removed from the plight of normal Americans to see what's going on. I guess we can always revisit some of the art to come out of that *other* Depression back in the 1930s, like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.The book centers around the Joad family from Oklahoma. Having lost their farm to the bank they decide to move to California after seeing fliers advertising high pay for farm workers, and hit the road in an old truck converted to haul all their worldly belongings. On the road, however, they notice a lot of others in similar circumstances are also heading to California with similarly high hopes. And when they arrive they find a vast oversupply of labor has driven down wages to levels making it impossible to support a family. Even worse, however, they arrive to find that nearly all the land is owned by huge corporate farmers who are colluding to exploit workers and keep wages low, and using law enforcement officials to prevent unions from forming.In spite of the optimism the Joad family has for making a better life in California, this is not a happy story and was not meant to be such. Steinbeck famously wrote \\"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this,\\" and there's a lot of that same sentiment today. While the migrant worker aspect of the story might remind readers more of the Mexican workers of today along with its attendant racism (\\"Okies\\" were as reviled as \\"illegal immigrants\\" are now), the fear of losing one's home and not being able to provide for a family will resonate with most everyone. And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families. The Joads find themselves disintegrating even while on the road, and they learn that they must rely on their larger community more and more. Assistance by the federal government is an oasis from the persecution by the harassment of the California deputies, but isn't enough for them to become self-reliant again.The style of the writing is fairly raw in its portrayal of the poor. The Joads are people of the land and their language is coarse and talk of sex is frequent. Nonetheless, they come across as honest and deserving of respect and sympathy. Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters that leave the Joads to show the larger view of the situation. And while I found some of these diversions annoying, the overall story is so powerful it makes the reader angry at the situation. Also, it took me about 150 pages before I really got into the story. It's not what you'd call a \\"pleasurable\\" read, but it's compelling for the gravity of the story and you can't help but feel hopeful for the family to get a break. And it's probably a story that should be read again in these difficult economic times."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As staged in the 1920&iexcl;s, Steinbeck starts with a subtle beginning. A slow developing plot, but worth while if you be patient. This book is definitely worth the time and effort, if you read a book once a year. A mixture of both intimidation and desperation sets fills your mind, and entices you to continue reading. The Joads, a family of four from Oklahoma, are on a journey westward toward California, with grandpa and grandma, after a famine sets over and destroys most of their crops. As the story continues on, the Joads realize that death and hatred pay a significant part out of their country. Death was the biggest cost from reaching their goal. Many family members died, and so, the family started to question the destiny. Being intimidated and threatened treason from the other states, the Joads feel despised. There is only one communication that Steinbeck wants to communicate, &iexcl;the hard workers survive&iexcl;. The weak does not. The perseverance and indifference from the other people create this silence war from other states. Some where nice folks and some didn&iexcl;t crack a smile at all. People not only scorn them, but actually refuse to serve them. As a book, it would be one of the most memorable one, and to compensate the slow pace, the conclusion. The Great Depression brought many people down, and this is actually what life was during that time.It is fairly a nice body, with many uses of southern accented language. Steinbeck should be famous for using all those apostrophes and accents, which I would never know how to do it. &iexcl;I ain&iexcl;t got nothin&iexcl; for you, boy,&iexcl; quotes the Joads, as an example.The ending was actually quite a shock. It was like, &iexcl;then I woke up and it was all a dream&iexcl; endings. I don&iexcl;t want to spoil it, and certainly I wouldn&iexcl;t tell you. It was abrupt and unexpected. A must read to all people of all ages, but beware; you are in for many surprises."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Nestled between the parched earth of the Oklahoma country and the flooded fields of the California valley lies a tale so stark that its own nakedness adorns it like the most precious jewel. The story is narrated in the rustic tongues of the Joad family and the poetic maelstrom of the author's conscience; the guileless, earthy wisdom of country folks and the refined, high-flying ideology of Steinbeck. I don't recall being more moved by any other piece of literature ever.The younger Tom Joad is easily one of the finest characters I've read. There is no magic attributed to Tom or his family and the author does not ask you to suspend reality anywhere in the novel. If anything, the reality is so overwhelming that I often found myself breaking in-between and taking a few minutes off to unwind.The book is written with excruciatingly detailed observations like \\"Joad took the bottle from him (Casy, the preacher), and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank\\"! To write something like that, a person would have to have powers of perception that transcend sight or sound. We've read so many times of vague emotions; unidentifiable joys, unnamed pains, inexplicable kinship and intuitive distrust. With Steinbeck, there is no ambiguity. It is, as is.Every alternating chapter details the journey of the Joads while the ones in between are the author's discourse on the larger issue of human depravity of which the sufferings of the Joad family are but the most nominal instance. My favourite such chapter in the entire novel was Chapter 25. To quote, \\"The Spring is beautiful in California. Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea. Then the first tendrils of the grapes, swelling from the old, gnarled vines, cascade down to cover the trunks. The full green hills are round and soft as breasts\\"...The author proceeds to describe in the most tender and in the most fascinated of terms, the luscious growth of fruits and vegetables and flowers and the men who work to create this marvel of plenty. He sings paeans to their ingenuity and slowly trundles through to the ripening and maturing of this plentiful produce and suddenly we find ourselves facing the most abhorrent of truths. In the face of exploitation and refusal to pay the wages for this harvest to be reaped, Steinbeck wreaks his vengeance on this paradisical beauty so elegantly painted in his lyrical prose. He commands the birds and the wasps and the flies to feast on the decaying, stinking, putrefying apparition left in the aftermath of his destructive force. His weapon, his mighty pen. Truly, no sword could obliterate with such completeness.\\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seeds fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten. And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow.\\"Steinbeck has had his revenge. It does little to comfort him.\\"There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success.\\"I shook when I was done reading this chapter. I am no Communist, not even quite a Socialist. But this book is one of the finest examples of how high the human mind can fly, how far and wide it can see, how unflinchingly it can comprehend and how limitlessly it can feel. I consider myself most fortunate to have read this book. Read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I can remember the brown clouds rising up and sweeping over our home, even in Oklahoma City in the early 1950's. And the stories from my parents and grandparents who stayed in Oklahoma through the depression, and the stories from my grandmother who moved to California looking for work, but it wasn't until 1967 when I was in the Navy in San Diego situations would inspire me to read this book.Even today in California, being called an &quot;Okie&quot; is not a compliment. It is said with a derogatory note of disdain akin to so many other predjudicial nicknames, and you really don't feel the entire impact unless one is directed at you.What was this about? Why was there such an attitude towards people from Oklahoma? A friend told me I would find the answers in this book. It was in reading this book I lost my naivete about the depth of human prejudice and callousness. It was this book that inspired me to participate in civil rights demonstrations when the Navy transfered me to Mississipi.

The farming-belt of the mid west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dust bowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level, as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate had in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of New Mexico and Arizona and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to give but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold her family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is the story of the Joad family, a family that has been forced off of their land in Oklahoma during the 1930's.

John Steinbeck's skills as a writer are amazingly displayed throughout, and what most struck me about this novel is the way he can transition from one chapter that delves so fearlessly into the inner psyches of his characters to another that looks at the time period and events unfolding with an almost documentary-like detachment.I can see how this book can turn off some. I must admit that the first time I started it, I didn't get past the first 100 pages or so. But something about it kept nagging at me to finish, and by the end of that particular summer, I had. Then I re-read it a few years later, and couldn't put it down. What keeps it so readable, at least for me, is the pure respect and dignity with which Steinbeck treats his characters. These are decent, hard-working people trying to make the most that they can out of a desperate situation, and the book is never condescending.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is filled with such humanity that it very nearly brings one to tears at several points---yet it's never maudlin. A scene involving a diner waitress offering free candy to two poverty-stricken children could be saccharine in any other hands, but here it's a wonderful instance of one human reaching out to another. And in a world like the one portrayed here, where retaining even the barest vestiges of human dignity becomes a struggle, scenes like the one above take on immense proportions.It's a shame that to many this book represents drudgery. For me it was actually intensely readable, to the point that I didn't want to stop, and the ending took my breath away. Again, it could have been hammy and heavy-handed, but it wasn't. Not with Steinbeck behind the scenes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was the masterpiece of Steinbeck's carrer, the full embodiment of his previous writings, his social, political, and religious views, as well as his look on human nature.Take it as a prediction for a socialist revolution in America, take it as a revelation of human injustice, take it as a story of the American Dream and the will to survive, whatever the book means to you, you'll take something away from reading it. Even if you don't buy into Steinbeck's political and religious views - that we are all &quot;one soul&quot; and that should work together as one big family - you will feel a compassion for the injustice that has occured to the working poor throughout history. It is a harrowing and powerful novel well worthy of five stars and its place as a classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Must read! Wonderful descriptions and character development. One of my top favorites."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Truly one the greatest books of all time, and my favorite book as well, from my favorite author. This book has two different chapter styles, one is the traditional story, the other is strange, poetic observational view of the immigrants plight as a whole and the twisted, corrupt world they must live through. The story begins with Tom Joad returning to his home in Oklahoma from prison. When he gets home however, he finds his family kicked off their farmland. Since the family before their eviction had been getting notices from california that made California seem like some kind of utopia full of food, long green fields, and happiness seeping from the land. So the family, along with some other people, head on to California across the country. Along the way however, the family witness trauma, injustice, and hardships as they head onward to California. And when they finally get there, they recieve even more pain and agony, and are constantly geeting abused by the oppression and injustice forced upon them by everyone else around them, from the law enforcers, to the regular California citizens.This book is not quite for the light of heart, or the hopeful and optimistic, and possibly conservative. This book hits you heavy, and leaves you in a glum, melancholy state. Any glimpse of hope or happiness found within the dark confines of this book is ripped apart, raped, and thrown into the infinite blackness within these pages. John himself that he wanted the reader to not quite feel satisfied but rather deppressed and sad after reading this book, And John succeeds greatly. John, who I consider the king of character emotion and development in literature, perfectly paints the dark and twisted world he set out to create, and has perfect characters to inhibatit it to boot. I won't tell you about anything else so you can read the book in a comftorble cloud of uncertainty, But prepare to see characters strained and twisted and bent under the injustice they must endure, as well as characters who break under it all.The other style of chapters in this book is interesting and further establishes this book's identity. It is a poetic style of prose that observes the plight of the immigrants as a whole, from their land evictions, to finding a car with the little money they have, to the journey westward and the perils that follow it, the the pain they must enudre in California. These chapters hit you so hard that you may find yourself recuperating from the book and laying down on the couch, resting your fractured head. This just makes the book all the more disturbing in its power.Besides the fact that this book does drag on a little bit in a few parts, I can't really think of a problem with it. I have heard that some people (Mostly rule following scholars and other people of such a type) din't like it because of the book bring too sentimental, and the talkin' style of the Joads and immigrants was a littl' stupid or somethin' like that. I for one found the dialogue interestng, and anybody that thinks this book overtly sentamental is most likely an emotionally hardened, cold person.

However, once they get there, they find that there is not much work to be found and even if they get work, the pay isn't fair. The Californians they encounter treat them with disdain, calling them \\"Okies\\" and fearful that these newcomers might band together and take over the land.John Steinback's writing is so vivid that you could almost believe that the main characters actually existed in real life. The protagonist, Tom Joad, is portrayed as a man willing to protect his family, but with a temper that occasionally interferes with the course of his life. The novel opens with Tom Joad being released on parole from killing a man in self-defense. The man he encounters on his way back home, Jim Casy, is another artfully crafted character; a preacher with a penchant for giving long speeches about life and its inner workings. They walk together to Tom Joad's former residence, only to find that it is deserted. When they get to the house of Tom's uncle, the rest of his family is preparing to move, thus Tom Joad and Casy decide to go with them to California, and so the story goes on.A combination of authentic Oklahoma dialogue and articulate descriptions of scenery and action allow this novel to almost live and breathe, as if it is being presented before your eyes. The effect of this novel is similar to that of Charles Dickens' writing; that is, the novel is so close to the history it represents, it will leave quite an impact upon you and serve as a reminder to how powerful great story-telling can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story. Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light!The characters in this book are simply put \\"inspiring\\"! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second. I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate! I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family. (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!)If you like the premise of this book, try reading \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl Buck.John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Since the birth of America in 1776, this country was known as the place where the poor could come and get rich. Reflected in the politic, religion, arts and literature; the possibility of hard-working, moral families falling thru the cracks and becoming poor was unspoken in the American psyche. Yes, you could become poor if you took to the bottle, like Huck's father in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\". Yes, you could become poor thru illegitimate and illicit behavior, such as the fate of the protagonist in the \\"Scarlet Letter\\". And yes, if you were new to the country, your fate was likely poverty, such as that seen in Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\". But to be a native of America, white, Christian, upright, and hardworking, you were expected to succeed, or at least survive. Then came the harrowing experience that was the Great Depression and with it this novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".Playing out in a series of alternating chapters; half the book lays forth the personal experiences of the Joad family and those they cross paths with from Oklahoma to the grape fields of California. The other half of the book extends the experiences of this one family to those of the nation. To read this book is to understand the mechanisms by which individuals, families, and entire communities succumb to poverty, crime, destitution, and eventually death. The trials of the Joad family at the hands of banks, lending agencies, the police, creditors and employers is all to real back then and now. For example, within an impoverished community, creditors will often divide and conquer by offering jobs to the very poorest that require them to betray their fellow citizens; such as repossessing their property.One of the most important, and missed points of this book, is how the economic success of entire communities depends on mother nature. The Dust Bowl is a great example of economic disaster caused by natural events; a unique tragedy in US history, but a yearly experience in many other countries. Another important point in this book is that when it comes down to it, the US economy is built along the same lines as those of other countries past and present; land ownership. The wealth of the US and the relatively high living standards here can be argued to be due to the large amount of livable land.All in all this is one of the best books written in the 20th century. A careful reading of it provides insights into economics, sociology, human behavior, agriculture practices, the entire concept of property rights, migration and immigration, and the convolution of business and politics. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I finally got around to reading this classic tale of migrant workers during the Great Depression and I am so glad I made the effort. Lots of history here and a good explanation of the rise of the collective labor movement. I did study some of this in my school days and I would have enjoyed having the benefit of reading this relevant work back then. Steinbeck's portrait of the Joad family brings all of this much closer to home and some of the stories (most notably the chapter describing the roadside diner)are really terrific. It is not a quick read but it does stay with you. A great investment of your time to better understand major issues still confronting our country today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I can see why some may consider this book to be a jab at capitalism. It definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to demonizing banks and business. If you can set that aside (which I think most people can), this novel is truly one of the greatest American tales of all time. It would take a cold-heart person to not be moved by the story of the Joad family. My favorite Steinbeck was always Of Mice and Men, but THe Grapes of Wrath easily took its place the from the second I finished it. You must read this amazingly well-written novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of those who left their friends and extended family in the Mid-west to pursue the American dream in California. Steinbeck painted a vivid picture of the struggles and hopes of poor men and women. They weren't looking for wellfare, but simply a job so they could feed their families and get ahead.The story focuses on the Joad family as they sell most of their possessions to raise enough money for the long journey from Oklahoma to California. Intermixed with their story are great descriptions of the land, the road they took (Route 66), and the hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing the Joad's were doing.The book doesn't get into the factors that led so many families to head West, and after reading \\"The Worst Hard Time\\", it doesn't appear to be the Dust Bowl as much as it was the overall depression the country was going through in the 1930's.While I enjoyed the descriptions and brutal honesty of the novel, I knocked off a star because I didn't care for Ex-Reverand Casy's view on morality nor the ending of the book that left me wanting more closure for the Joad family. The ending got me to California with the Joad's, but didn't give me any sense of their fate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I received this book and couldn't believe the good condition it was in.

And what a great talent as a writer Steinbeck was. His easy, fluid, yet intensely descriptive style is second to none. I have read books by him I appreciated more, and books I appreciated less, but I would say that this is his masterpiece. His high level of detail meshes perfectly with a gloomy, depressing slice of real American history. All of which he intensely researched. It's a well told story, and provided me with quite a bit of mental fodder to mull over. You don't have to bond with, or even like, the main characters, to enjoy the epic and panoramic nature. I am an artist and writer. I write my own novels now. Steinbeck still remains one of my biggest influences.You don't have to agree with every position held by Steinbeck to enjoy his writing, and at no point in this does he push communism on the reader. You know what one of my favorite novels is? Atlas Shrugged. I vote libertarian. My favorite genres tend to be dark Sci-Fi and horror. That's what I write, and what magazines I do illustrations for. That is also entirely beside the point."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"My whole work drive has been aimed at making people understand each other. . . .\\" --Steinbeck in a 1938 letterAfter years of suffering through the Great Depression and sweeping devastation caused by \`Black Blizzards' during the Dust Bowl era, farmers and share-croppers of the southern plains began an odyssey toward hope and the green valleys of California. This was a time of sweeping social and economic changes. This was a time when banks, powerful land owners, mechanized farming, prejudice and bigotry sent people packing.While working as a journalist in San Francisco, John Steinbeck wrote a series of feature articles about these migrant workers. He developed a powerful respect for their initiative and empathized with their plight. Those articles were the stimulus that drove him to write Grapes of Wrath. A short time after its publication, Grapes of Wrath received the 1939 Book of the Year Award from the American Booksellers Association. In 1940 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.Steinbeck used powerful, lyrical prose while establishing many of the scenes his characters lived in and passed through. He had a gift of writing in the vernacular language of the people of Oklahoma, and the surrounding states. Most chapters were anchored in dialog between the Joad family members and those with whom they had contact. Most of the story centers on protagonist Tom Joad, second son and parolee from an Oklahoma state prison. Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family is the bond that keeps the family together.The first half of the book follows the family along Route 66 from eastern Oklahoma across the state into the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona and deserts until they are awed by the beauty of Califonia. Along the way, they experience devastating losses, disappointment, and innumerable hardships. The Joad family meets and bonds with fellow travelers, and experiences generosity by a restaurant cook and waitress. After arriving in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there. At times he breaks up the journey and branches into short narratives that read like prose poems. In these narratives he frequently uses repetition to drive home his message. He hammers on banks. He has little patience for land owners who call the migrants squatters even though they acquired the land earlier though questionable means.He shows us sheriffs, vigilantes and private security officers working as pawns of the powerful. These are the implements of injustice and the source of escalating tensions. They will stop at nothing to quash dissent. Migrants are exploited through the devaluation of their work by these land owners.Grapes of Wrath lives up to its accolades. Be prepared for an emotional ride. Use it as an opportunity to assess your prejudices and preconceived ideas about this trying time in our history. If you haven't read Grapes of Wrath, you need to do so.The Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"In this novel about Oklahoma farmers forced by the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression to seek a new life for themselves as migrant laborers in California, John Steinbeck may well have written the Great American Novel. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the Joad family, but it's also the story of a people on the move, a nation in crisis, and humanity in its extremes of greed and goodness.The first quarter of the novel tells of young Tom Joad's homecoming after several years in prison for killing a man in a drunken brawl. Contact with his family has been minimal over the years, and he looks forward to seeing his parents, grandparents, and siblings again - but the house is empty, obviously abandoned, like so many others in this land where a combination of drought and poor agricultural techniques has resulted in failure and foreclosure on countless family farms. Fortunately, Tom learns from a neighbor that his family has gone over to his uncle's place, and he arrives there just in time to join them on their way to California, where they've been told there's plenty of work in the state's lush Central Valley.The second quarter of the novel is the story of the Joads' arduous journey west on Route 66, a trip distinguished by breakdowns, death, and intimations by those who have been there that California may be something less than the paradise they've been led to imagine. The final half of the novel follows the Joads after they arrive in California, only to discover that it's possible to starve even in a land of plenty as too many would-be workers are forced to compete for available jobs by accepting wages barely sufficient to buy enough food from one day to the next. The novel ends with one of the most stunning and affecting scenes you'll ever read, and although nothing at all is resolved, the story feels complete.The structure of the novel underscores Steinbeck's creation of the Joads as the human face of a social crisis. Long chapters that advance the plot alternate with short chapters in which the Joads are never mentioned, in which Steinbeck's richly poetic prose establish the physical and moral setting of his work: the conditions leading to the Dust Bowl, the loss of a way of life, the journey to a new beginning, and the disillusionment and growing anger of the migrants - all on a massive scale. These short, poignant chapters are as beautiful, captivating, and necessary as the story chapters, as they provide context and grant a kind of holy universality to the Joads' experiences.Steinbeck's writing is raw, earthy, and viscerally powerful. This is realism at its finest: full of small, telling details, and at times casually vulgar, not for shock value but because life itself is casually vulgar. I was about 13 the first time I read this novel, and the blunt honesty of the writing was a bit much for my somewhat sheltered mind; I remember feeling uncomfortable when an old man reached into his pants and \\"contentedly scratched under the testicles,\\" as that wasn't a word I was used to seeing in print, at least outside of biology texts. I loved the background chapters but found the Joad chapters distasteful for the first hundred pages or so, when I finally allowed the vivid immediacy of Steinbeck's style to make the characters real for me. As an adult, I have no such difficulties and am able to appreciate the masterful style and rich characterizations immediately. This is a mature novel, about people too crassly human to elicit our pity, but too warmly human not to elicit our compassion.I must admit that as a native Californian, I feel a special connection with this novel. For most of my life I lived just a few blocks away from the old Route 66 (although farther west than the point where the Joads left it to go north). Several of my husband's children live in the Central Valley, around places Steinbeck mentions by name. However, Steinbeck's skill is such that even if you've never been there, you'll close this novel feeling as though you had. This is a novel every American should read - indeed, everyone interested in what it means to be human in trying times. These days more than ever we need this book, we need this reminder of the values of proud self-sufficiency and fierce decency, for it is when we stop pulling, and pulling together, that we lose our way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The book arrived in described condition in a timely manner. This is an excellent edition if one is reading this for educational purposes. I'm just reading for pleasure, but it's nice to have the extra info if needed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck took place in Oklahoma. Steinbeck shows many classic examples of the events in the 1930's. For an example how farmers in the Dust Bowl suffered not only from the drought but the Depression also. I liked how Steinbeck is always paying attention to detail when he describes the family's and the living conditions.The 1930's was a very bad time for this nation. I think that Steinbeck not only shows the Depression setting but also what they done in order to survive. Steinbeck gives many examples of how the family's lived and their everyday lives. I think that this is important because unless you lived during the 1930's you wouldn't know how things were.He gives many examples along the journeys of the family's life from their home place to search for more work to feed their families. By doing this it gives the reader a glimpse of how they might have had to live if they lived during that time period. Sometimes it feels as if you are right there on the journey with the families. Like the world today only the strong survived the Depression in the 1930's. Some of the events that happen in The Grapes of Wrath are very sad and touching all at once.I suggest that if you want to learn about the Depression and the 1930's this is the book to read. It is not only is packed full of examples but takes you along with the family's journey for success in California. This book will make you glad that you're not in the Joad family's shoes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"John Steinbeck is the most perceptive and creative authors I've read.

As for Joad's family , they decided to move to California to find better jobs and get a new life. On the trip to California, Joad's family met other family that also moved to the West. They helped each others to survive through the hardship. The humanity that people had for each other was so wonderful, and nothing was better than that. I don't think nowaday we can have that humanity in society because as time has changed, people don't share similar experience and it hard for them to understand each other."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"While Steinbeck's masterwork fit more perfectly into the era of recovery from the Great Depression, it addresses human interrelations in a most timeless fashion. Those of us who have discovered what it means to lose all (or nearly all) of our tangible possessions, as the Joads did, grasp a deeper meaner of life. The Joads demonstrate greater respect for fellow humans than for the clothes on their backs.Steinbeck also provides an eloquent look at those who clawed their way to retain tangible wealth. These people wanted no part of sharing with folks in desperate need and Steinbeck demonstrates this through both the path of the Joads from Oklahoma to California as well as more general looks at the circumstances of the dustbowl's victims."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read this awhile ago, but it sticks in my head.

This is a reading worthy of this magnificent novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book cannot but be considered one of the greatest works of American literature. Its plot is simple, almost literally pedestrian, but it magically conveys the feelings not just of its characters, but of an entire social movement and era.The device of alternating chapters between the tale of the Joad family and descriptive narratives of the society around them only strengthens things. This is no academic, dusty view of history; this is reality, as people lived and thought and experienced.The human attachment to the soil, the desire for home and community, the struggle for social justice, the tyranny of property, the myth of the Promised Land, the hope and dreams of a new life - there is something here on every level, the social, the spiritual, and the emotional.The beginning of the novel is a bit slow, but it slowly picks up momentum as it travels west. By its end, one cannot but be riveted by the Joads and the struggles they endure. And one can feel the grapes of wrath building, the knowledge that some way, somehow, the human will to survive can never be defeated.But, despite its clear social messages, this is not a political tract. The novel's ending takes one of the most intimate of human actions into a bare, stark necessity. Eroticism, motherhood, generosity, desperation - what is it? We cannot tell for sure, but we know only that it is human. The most horrific of our trials only serve to bring out our humanity. A haunting and unforgettable message."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was required reading for school and our bookstore sold out fast.

Steinbeck writes with a simple elegance, while telling a sad, yet compelling story about struggles through the Great Depression.In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck uses a peculiar combination of diction. Overall, the book seems very conversational. Steinbeck uses very simple words, with the occasional large word thrown in, with a folksy sort of feel. His use of simple diction makes the book extremely understandable, in turn making it more relatable as people tend to relate to things they understand.To get more specific in areas concerning diction, I'd like to discuss the diction used when Steinbeck includes dialogue. In the dialogue, Steinbeck's grammar is atrocious. Words are left incomplete, sentences unfinished; the grammar is just awful. However, this does not detract from the appeal of the novel as would be suspected. It instead enhances the appeal of the book by making it more realistic. The way Steinbeck shows the way people would have talked in the era of the Great Depression. Personally, I quite appreciate Steinbeck's efforts to make the novel as realistic as humanly possible.The other aspect of Steinbeck's writing in The Grapes of Wrath that I came to really enjoy and appreciate was his use of figurative language and imagery. Steinbeck does a phenomenal job painting a picture in the readers' heads. He uses very detail oriented style, full of very rich adjectives.While the adjectives do more to fill the role of imagery, Steinbeck has an incredible talent in his use of figurative language. I found one of his favorite figurative language devices to be the extended metaphor. In one of the between chapters (the broad chapters, that aren't character specific) almost everything was an extended metaphor, and everything was being compared to one central thing. Everything was compared to a monster; the bank, the tractors, even the guys who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster. Even in the chapters that were character specific, Steinbeck loves his extended metaphors.Steinbeck uses these devices, and many others, to create what is a literary masterpiece in my mind. An important story was shared with the many people who have read and will read this book. It is a book that can be read multiple times and a person wouldn't tire of it. Steinbeck's use of simple, detail oriented diction creates a wonderful base on which to build such a story.This being the first of Steinbeck's works that I have read, I have been thoroughly impressed and will continue to read novels written by him. The Grapes of Wrath tells a phenomenal story in a simple fashion that is so incredibly understandable, and relatable, that I found myself completely drawn into the story; after the first 150 pages or so anyway, which I found to be a bit slow. Even so, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, understandable book to read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Powerful, gripping, and realistic story of one Oklahoma family, along with other migrants, forced to migrate to California due to changes in financial and agricultural industries.

This is a novel for mature readers who enjoy books which don't have excessive violence, or mindless action on every page. Many high school kids are clearly not mature enough to appreciate a book such as The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps their teachers should let them stick with works that are better suited to their maturity level, such as comic books...."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"i dont know why everyone hates this book. not only is it &quot;america's novel&quot;, its a novel that can be planted into todays plight of the mexicans and italians. its a story that is timeless and sincere and has much more significance than all those &quot;la-di-da&quot; novels that sell for 20 bucks and are composed of pure smut. you want some deep emotion read this book. i cant understand why everyone hated it i just think they are a bunch of immature asses who either cant read it or have no deeper literary aspirations. thats my opinion, bite me!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I think the reason why I love this book is because 60 years after it was written, it still has a place in our society.

This is the timeless story of the struggle for survival. This time concerning the Joad family - a simple crop sharing farm people - uprooted by changes both climatic and economic (it reminds one of the recent downsizing and the loss of blue collar jobs) on their trek westward searching for a new hope. This book works on all levels and raises important issues if you can get a handle on the depression. As literature it is excellent. Any author that can devote an entire chapter to the life-and death struggles of a turtle crossing the road and keep you on the edge of your seat deserves fame (what is the symbolism any how?). This book also raises the important issues of today. What to do with displaced (homeless) people? Who's responsible if anyone for peoples well-being. Are their abuses in the work place? Who's fault is it? What should be done? Are simple people to be admired or pitied?. Fortunately, he doesn't give you all the answers, but makes you think for yourself. Admittedly, he does go into melodrama. His brief dealings about the communist ideals with the government camp, and the breast feeding of an ill man showing how people must help themselves are two such examples. Yet, I feel it is a must read even if it leaves you drained and questioning your own ethics."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, &quot;the map is not the territory?&quot; Just as TV and movie actors are mistaken for their characters, so are authors often taken for their stories. No, kids, Mark Twain was not a racist, in spite of the langauge of his characters. Had these myopic critics opened their eyes a little more, they might have seen that Jim the slave is a superior man to his lighter-skinned contemporaries. What &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; represents to some is a threat, a not-so- gentle stirring up of uncomplacencies, a brutal kick in the rear to the comfortable. Working in a grocery store I see this every day in my affluent customers. Most haven't a clue where or how their fruits and vegetables make their way to the produce stands. Some have vague ideas about unwashed and illiterate Mexicans, toiling away in the feilds like beasts of burden. I live in California, home to Proposition 187, and all of the attendant misconceptions about illegal immigrants. Why, it was only last year when federal authorities raided a strawberry farm in the Salinas Valley, discovering living conditions that mirrored exactly those portrayed in Steinbeck's novel sixty years before. In spite of the efforts of Ceasar Chavez, whom I regard as a saint, and uncounted others, working conditions for the farm worker have scarcely improved since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Remember the grape boycott?I'm getting a bit afield, I know. I recently tried out an American literature course at my local community college, and was unpleasantly surprised. Instead of a careful reading of good books, I was inundated with the crimes of the Eurocentric Male. Oh, and the books were included as supporting garnish. Seems to me that our culture of destructionism and revisionism is taking an awful toll upon our understanding of literature. Like the traveler confusing the map with the territory, our unimaginative academics are confusing the messenger with the message. Rather than spending precious time bashing the author, wouldn't it be more prudent to disucss the ideas as presented? Had Steinbeck been a Communist, would his ideas then be considered more suspect? I invite other readers to share their ideas. We need more of this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It does not surprise me that those brilliantly compassionate people who above criticized the book could only come up with: it sucks, man, its a piece of sh*t. What in depth understanding of the book! When it was released in 37, it became the most controversial book of its time. People saw hints at revolution in it; communism was seen. People thought that the harsh portrayal of class differences and some of the &quot;tough&quot; imagery and ideas given to the reader, along with the possibilty that America was not perfect and was deeply corrupted and injust, were reasons to ban this poignantly beautiful and epic story that defines an important novel and is both significantly historical and universal in its content. Those who argue for it to be banned today, like those who ban Huck for being racist(when its one of the greatest anti-racist books ever written), Salinger, and Of Mice and Men, do not understand it; perhaps they haven't read it- if they have, the obvious importance and beauty of the book has been lost on them. So yippedeedo! Once again people think it their right to keep us from reading books that are not only worth the read but important in literature and very influential in enhancing our moral intelligence.

While the movie focuses on the character of Tom Joad, Steinbeck's book is really about Tom's mother, and how she eventually assumes the leadership of her family. The pages are literally choked with the red dust of Oklahoma's ruined farms, and of the dust and exhaust fumes on the road to California. The dialogue is colloquial and accurately portrayed. His characters are rich in substance, as is the entire story. Throughout the book, the scene is introduced with poetically-written interludes, giving the reader a clear sense of where he or she is.

They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history.

It so perfectly represents the 30's depression, and America in general. It opened my mind to the values of this country, and inspired me to see everything from a different eye. This is a book that will change your life. I will not vote for a president who has not read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"At first when I started out, I wasn't too sure I would want to continue. This book is written in local dialect which I thought would be tedious but I was in for a surprise for it was not. After a while I began to love the dialect as much as I loved this book to tell the truth. No wonder John Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for this work.The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joads; a Dustbowl family from Oklahoma whose land was confiscated from them, along with others in the Midwestern states. All these families head for California where it is understood that there is lots of opportunity in that golden state to start again. This being in immigrant work or farm labour in grape, pear and peach reaping.The trek is long but it's supposed to be well worth it with expectant good wages. and somewhere decent to live, somewhere to call home.Meet the Joad family of Ma Joad; a good Christian woman and as the strength and spine of the family, she holds a tight reign on the entire bunch of them retaining their team spirit, and keeping the morale alive amongst them. Then there is Casey a sometimes preacher man; Tom Joad her eldest son who is driven and afraid of nobody, but just anxious to get out to California to make some money; his brother Noah, a man consumed by quiet moments and little to say; Al the brother who drives the loaded down truck from Oklahoma, out to the West; Uncle John a restless soul, but who can blame him! These along with Pa Joad, the Joad sister Rose of Sharon, and the young ones Ruthie and Winfield, they make up the exodus. An exodus like none ever seen, we share in each heartache and disappointment as well as their hopefulness which Ma stokes daily.As the Joad family turn from farmers in their own right to immigrant workers, it gets harder for the family to retain their dignity. The reader will find himself living through these characters lives, and experiencing gratefulness for the little things which are so often taken for granted day in and day out.I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon. It certainly encouraged me to look at life differently.Reviewed by Heather MarshallJanuary 10th, 2003"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"John Steinbeck, in my opinion, is probably the most talented author I have ever read. His descriptions are awe-inspiring, his narration unique, and his stories are emotional rollercoasters. I found myself, while reading 'The Grapes', at all times either laughing, crying, or just plain ticked off. In this novel is portrayed one of the saddest, yet least know tradgedies in our countries history. The story of farmers kicked out of their homes, forced to a strange land and despised, cheated, and starved when they arrived reminded me of medievil times but the sad fact is it happened while our grandparents were growing up. I admit I was not proud of America as I read this book! But it is oh so important of a read because if it can happen 50 years ago it can happen today, and only by learning from history can we avoid these same mistakes.But despite the feelings you may have while consuming this book please do not avoid it, for it is a must read. If you have somehow made it past high school without having read this one, then why not do it now. It is probably the best book I have read by an American author and too important to pass up. I don't guarantee you will happily enjoy it but I do guarantee you will be better for having read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"In John Steinbeck's fictional classic, The Grapes of Wrath, readers get aboard the Joad family's jalopy and venture through the southwestern part of America during the 1930s Dust Bowl. Through Steinbeck's intense descriptions and meticulous detail, his characters pop out of the book, and become alive in the reader's imagination. Due to these dynamic figures, readers begin to feel their emotions, experience their struggles, and share in their happiness. Although the tone underlines a grueling expedition, one filled with hardships, losses, and failures, readers still recognize that tremendous bond and overwhelming love within a family can prevail over all. Steinbeck's use of setting is critical in the book. The setting adds to the impact of suffering experienced by the characters and sets the dismal tone for the novel.The characters are so extensively described that a perfect portrait of each member of the journey is painted into the readers mind. Physically and emotionally we know who they are: laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry. The book sends a powerful message of everlasting love which is identified with all readers. The dry, dusty, hot, and painstaking setting is influential in the family's drive. The luscious, green, moist land of California lures the readers in for an unreachable dream, and symbolizes a life that the Joad's can never have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class.

Surely my decision to drift through a test and a paper on other people's discussions (ranging from 'greatest book ever' to 'a tiring, endless bore')was appropriate at the time for my cynical inexperience had not yet adjusted me for the sheer force of humanity of this titanic struggle.A story in pictures and abbreviated words, The Grapes of Wrath paints an honest vision of crushing defeat endured through hard times when visualized hopes were the only things required for living. We are swept in to a duststorm, a cascade of brief apocaylpse that batters our eyes shut only to force them open to see what is going on beneath the howl of the wind. This is what calamities cause and here is how man will always scramble for survival.The world opens up and becomes filled with people, beginning with the solitary wandering of a just-released inmate ambiling through the dead, dried out land, to search for his family. People join and surround Tom--later the Joads--and the dazed survivors all travel, bringing customs, and search the wide world for a new place to make a living. Their dreams and ambitions mix and then expand, groups are formed, families split apart and multiply, the crush of the storm has infected the people and now they go forward and tear up even more of the land in the search for a home.The book ends in the rain, all pain and dryness washed away into the mud, the dreams coming to an end, situations grown more desperate but at least temporarily endurable--the truth about where hope lay shining and glistening before them, lost in the bible or dreams of wealth or hopes for the future or the nucleus of a loving family surrounding them. Something is planted in that rain, finally, the milk of human kindness mixing with the mud to burst forth flowers and dew and yet another new chance to make something out of survival.It really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The novel The Grapes of Wrath written by John Steinbeck is a master peace of literature. Through the travels of the Joad family you get an incredible feeling of what it felt like to travel during the Dust Bowl of the late 1930's. The novel starts with a recently paroled Tom Joad hitchhiking to his family's farm in Oklahoma. After being let off, Tom starts walking towards where his farm was before he was put in prison for homicide. Soon after he begins walking he meets up with another main character, Jim Casy who is a former preacher. After shooting the breeze for a while the both of them continue the journey to the Joad farm. Upon arriving at the farm, they find it deserted. Tom, clueless as to what happened does not know what to do. After looking around the property for a while, Tom notices his neighbor Muley Graves, coming towards him and the preacher. Tom asks him if he knows where the Joad family is. Muley states because they cannot afford to stay on their land they were forced to relocate to Uncle John's farm. After spending the night at the Joads house, the preacher and Tom Joad continue on their journey to Uncle John's. When they arrive at Uncle John's two things happen to Tom. First of all his own mother does not recognize him, second of all, after everyone does figure who he is, they all asked him when he escaped. To which he replied, \\"I was paroled\\". Soon the family realizes they cannot celebrate Tom's freedom. They quickly load their 27' Dodge pick- up with all the belongings they will need, and soon they are on their way to California. The character that forms his identity throughout the book is the main character Tom Joad. He does what is best for the group by going with his family to California. He easily could have stayed in Oklahoma where it would be safe for him. But instead he breaks his parole in order to go California with his loved ones. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who likes thinking while they read. A book such as this one deserves the utmost attention while reading it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"My title says it all.

It is the most compassionate book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I am a John Steinbeck lover for sure. In this wonderful depiction of the horrors the Oklahoma farmers faced during the great dustbowl of the 1930's, I was once again awakened to what a story is supposed to be about. Too often, we are zapped with this wild tales of one explosion after another, with characters so much bigger than life that they would need the whole universe to survive in. Here, we see the intimate interactions of those who must struggle to survive in a hostile environment. We even see those little devilish schemes certain characters assume in order to be human. (The preacher is the perfect example.) I was mesmerized by the wonderful way the great novelist paints the mannerisms of each of his characters.The story evolves in a slow and natural way, blazing a trail through the perils the Joad family faces on their journey to California, where hope drives them and keeps them sane. And even when they complete this trials, other, more severe setbacks are waiting for them in ambush. It is a story of struggles and greed, of honesty and deceit. The story finds its way into the deepest chasms of your heart and then tears out a piece.I recommend reading other Steinbeck books first, to savor the best for last."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I think that everyone should read this book.

While I sometimes find Steinbeck a bit too descriptive and wordy, he definately tells a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"An extremely touching tale of a family seeking greener pastures, this book will surely change the way you look at big time capitalistic maneuvers. No denying that the big corporations brought the deadly efficiency and productivity to major markets, but in the face of all the success, one would tend to forget the millions of people who suffered for most of their lives to make way for the changes.It also brings us up close to the situations during post-depression times which drove people to abject poverty and suffering. The kind of treatment the characters of the book undergo due to the policies of the rich landowners will surely make you shudder with shock. People can be so cruel at times to their own fellow beings that it is hard to comprehend the reasons behind such behavior!Inspite of all the adversity, the characters in the book exude a level of endurance that is truly heartening. Anyone who reads this book will definitely face life's problems in a far more spirited and never-say-die manner. It definitely redefines one's conception of adversity and pain!I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the happenings which have moulded modern America. If not for the historical insight, this book is a fantastic journey into man's calibre to face challenges. One could read it just to discover the emotional strength of Ma in the Joad family. I am sure this is a book to be remembered for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"It's hard to know how to begin talking about a novel with as many threads running through it as the The Grapes Of Wrath. For me, it's primarily the story of how capitalism, initially a benign force, became the ravenous &quot;monster&quot; that it is today. But to portray The Grapes Of Wrath as merely some sort of leftist tract is to betray its power, its depth. It's the kind of novel that you're constantly quoting to people as you read it, picking it up and saying, &quot;Hey, listen to this...&quot;.It's simply one of the finest American novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"One of the great novels of the 20th Century. This should be required reading at the high school level.The story is that of the Joad's, a displaced family from Oklahoma who migrate West,looking for work in the rich agricultural areas of California.No novel tells the story of depression era America better than the Grapes of Wrath.The Joad's, like millions of other Midwestern and Southern farmers, lose their land through a combination of generations of bad farming techniques, dry weather that occurred several growing seasons in a row, and the depression.The end of the rainbow is California, rich in agriculture with the promise of plenty of work. Along the way the family endures physical and emotional hardships, as well as ridicule and humiliation.Once they arrive in California, the Joad's find that the labor supply is so plentiful that the promised jobs are either non-existant or the pay is paltry. Furthermore, the California land barons want the 'Okies' to stay only long enough to pick the crops and they employ whatever means necessary to keep workers migrant.There are many poignant scenes in this novel and the character of Ma Joad is truly a classic as she strives to keep her family together and from starving to death. The last scene involving the loss of a child and a straving man are heart rendering.But the real value of this novel is in the social conscience that it attempts to evoke. For his work Steinbeck was villified as a Communist, although his later work showed Steinbeck as a political moderate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The passionate saga of the Joad family, who like thousands of American farmers lose their homesteads through a combination of bad luck and poor farming techniques. The Joad's travel west under the false promise of plentiful work in agricultural rich California.The journey is long and frightening as the family endures humiliation and the threat of starvation. When they arrive in California the Joads discover thousands of other displaced 'Okies' looking for work forcing down wages that the landowners were are willing to pay. They also discover that the landowners will do whatever is necessary to keep wages low.The Grapes of Wrath is an important American novel that tells a tragic story of an American family trying to stay together and survive under the most dire of circumstances. Generations of young Americans have grown up and never seen economic hard times. Although the bleakness of the conditions may be exagerated, depressioon ravaged America was not anything like it is today. This book gives an insight into just how tough times were.Ma Joad is one of the strongest female characters ever depicted in American literature as she struggles to feed her family and keep them together. The last few pages involving the still born birth of a child and the feeding of a starving man are tragic. Steinbaeck's novel is passionate and heartbreaking and he had to endure public vilification because of it. His later writings revealed a more conservative nature. Every young American should experience this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I had to read this book for an English class and it is definitely the best book I have had to read for school in the last 5 years.

He wrote at a time of tumultuous social change and climatic severity in mid-west America. Faceless banks and machines were changing the labour-intensive family-based agriculture, and forced families and whole communities to migrate to California in vain hope. The image is of them being followed by a cloud of dust, as huge machines representing agribusiness and development ate at the soil like monsters. Steinbeck explored the negative trade-offs that are born when the land becomes removed from the psyche, and the whole, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. His is a sombre comment on an approach which places value on particular components of the land and their functions, to the exclusion of other components, and this included the people. Steinbeck seeks to claim back an holistic perspective of the land and makes comment on the inappropriateness of linear Analysis. His thesis is one that cries that the land is more than just its analysis, that there is some other dimension with deep personal and social implications involved.

So I decided to read it and it is very good. Each chapter has a new meaningful of what happens to the Joad's family, like the Joad's are heading of to California to look for a job. Each chapters are good but most chapters are boring because the family talk too much. That's why nobody likes this book. I think this is one of the best book I ever read because it tells you what does the Great Depression looks like. You feel that you are really in it. What's more this book is not just about the Joad's family but there is lots of information of what the depression looks like.

The truth was anything but! This story does not promote communism as some other reviewers on this page suggests, but rather shows the results when free market economy capitalism is exploited and perversed. The book shows that when labor organizes it is percieved as &quot;red&quot; since hundreds, if not thousands of individuals must publicly ban together. When the big boys (in this case the large farm land owners) ban together, they do it covertly and are never questioned about their patriotism.Steinbech has brought all of these moral and social issues together in his moving (if not sometimes over sentimental) story of the Joad family. Yes, it sometimes tends toward being long winded but it is one of the most compelling novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"&quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of the greatest novels of all time. I am 14, and after seeing the Henry Fonda movie, I decided to read the book. What a masterpiece! To those who want to cut all of the description, it is necessary. That is setting the mood. Without the description, it would just be some cold, detached dissertation on the Depression. The description entrenched me into the book. I didn't feel as if I was reading a book, I felt I was THERE. I was part of the family, traveling in the car, feeling their pains, feeling their joys. It was as if I was Jim Casy, tagging along with the Joad family. This book is a great experience for any high schooler. Along with To Kill a Mockingbird and Gone With the Wind, The Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest and most electrifying novels of all time.

I finished the book two weeks ago and have not been able to stop talking or thinking about it. Read this book. It will truly change the way you view the world.The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"I live in a citrus community in Florida, which is populated by a large number of migrant workers. It never occurred to me to wonder how they felt about their lives. I never thought to wonder if they had dreams of someday owning their own home and staying put for a while. I've read criticism that \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a communist manifesto. It may have socialist leanings, but how long can individuals or a society overlook the less fortunate without feeling some shame? Read this book. It should be mandatory, but would be wasted on most teenagers. Pick it up as an adult, as I did, and read it. You'll never again look at others or yourself in the same way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I don't know how anyone could read this book and not give it a five star rating. The true test for me of a &quot;great book&quot; is one that stays with me -- one I can't stop thinking about long after I've finished. I read this book for the second time in my life a month ago (first time was in high school many years ago), and I'm still haunted by the suffering endured by the Joad family. The interesting thing is that Steinbeck wrote this book in 1939 at the height of the injustices being fraught upon the migrant workers in California. I'm sure it wasn't popular then as it brought to the forefront the corruption of some powerful people in America. It also spoke to the conscience of every American which eventually led to political reform in California. After reading this book, I did some research into Steinbeck's motivation and learned that he was haunted by the plight of California's migrant workers to the point of obsession. To fuel his anger, he would visit the migrant camps each day full of their dirt, disease and hungry people and then return home to write about those people responsible for these conditions -- people he considered to be murderers.Steinbeck concentrated on the circumstances of one family, The Joads, tenant farmers in Oklahoma until they were forced out by the larger companies who wanted their land back. With dreams of luscious grapes and peaches in abundance waiting to be picked, they loaded up their belongings and began their journey on Route 66 headed for Bakersfield, California. They began their trip with a bevy of colorful characters led by Ma and Pa Joad. It's amazing how much power Steinbeck gave to Ma Joad -- years before women had any right to a voice. Unfortunately, just as the Joads were heading out, so were thousands upon thousands of other families. This would ultimately lead to supply and demand. There would be too many workers for the few jobs available and, consequently, people would be agreeing to work for peanuts just to be able to feed their families.Steinbeck's writing is astounding as the unrest of the migrants builds to a crescendo and just as the dust has risen in Oklahoma, so will the voices of the poor migrant workers. Steinbeck says, &quot;In the eyes of the hungry, there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are growing heavy.&quot; It is just a matter of time before their wrath is unleashed and you can feel it in every page you turn. He says that, &quot;Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God someday a kid can eat.&quot; I don't know how you can read some of his words and not get teary eyed. But sixty years have passed since the writing of this book and there are still migrant stories to be told and kids who have no food to eat yet sadly the world continues despite its injustices.I won't kid you into believing that this is an easy book to read. The first 150 pages are so slow going that I almost had to put it down. But I kept on going just as the Joad's kept on going and I'm certainly glad I did. We could all take a lesson from their quest for survival and their quest just to be able to eat the next day. Their determination, in light of all the obstacles they had to face, is truly a lesson to be learned. You feel a sense of accomplishment after reading a book like this -- I know I did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I have never read a better novel written by an American than THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Steinbeck's deeply touching tale of displaced families and a nation rent by Depression will never cease to be relevant.The Joads and thousands of others are driven out of Oklahoma by drought and the Depression. It is bad enough they lose their farms to homes and have to move. It is worse that the big business fruit growers in California print misleading flyers claiming to have far more well-paying jobs available than they ever intended to have. It is miserable when they get to California (where the people curse them as \\"Okies\\") and find out that as few as one man owns as much a million acres--much of it lying fallow in front of their eyes.As difficult as the plight of the Joads and families like them, Steinbeck does not paint the Californians or their police as evil so much as scared into treachery and violence in order to protect their own. No one wants to starve and starvation after the dust bowl and thanks to the exploitative wages paid by the vineyard owners is a very real possibility. Nor does he canonize the migrants--the societies that grow up by the side of the road each night have their own laws and lawbreakers, stout hearts and slatterns--but does show them as civilized people who don't deserve being treated like animals. Many fearful Californians don't agree.Steinbeck's character Tom Joad (whose ghost lives on in a Bruce Springsteen's song recently covered by Rage Against the Machine) is as important to American literature as Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and Jay Gatsby. Joad knows life offers no simple solutions, but he also knows that fair is fair. When a man's employers charge him for his work gear AND operate the stores where he must buy his food so that he often ends up OWING his employers more at the end of the week than his pitiful wages can cover, Tom Joad knows that's not just. He knows the land is fertile enough to feed everyone, so don't try giving him any speeches about \\"private property\\" and \\"supply and demand.\\" If the test of a system and a society is how it treats it poorest members (especially in a crisis like the Depression), then the world the Joads live in fails miserably.No less strong a character than her son Tom, Ma Joad embodies all the cliches about being a tower of strength without actually being a clich&eacute; herself. She and her family possess all the true grit and hearty spirit America prides itself on as a nation of pioneers, but by the 1930s the frontier has been bought up and the pioneers are in desperate straits.This book is occasionally criticized for being too socialistic. This criticism is misguided; what THE GRAPES OF WRATH does is show how capitalism can and often does enrich the few while the many suffer. Steinbeck shows how breadbasket farmers were thrown off the land they had worked for generations so bankers in the East can make more profit. Can this happen today, even in a time of tremendous prosperity? Ask today's family farmers what agribusiness has done to them. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is no call to play the \\"Internationale,\\" but it does starkly and intelligently raise questions about the meaning of equal opportunity and justice for all.This is a book that should be required reading for Alan Greenspan, the editors of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and triumphal capitalists everywhere who wince for their stock dividends when the unemployment rate goes down. Not to mention every single elected official in the United States. The subject matter is extremely heavy and sad, but Steinbeck's style is straightforward and easy (even with the various dialects he employs perfectly). THE GRAPES OF WRATH does what so very few great novels can: it will take a lot out of you, but leave you with much more than you had when you began."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; written in 1939 by John Steinbeck, is a book about the Great Depression, and one poor sharecropper family's struggle to survive the worst deprivations that American society in the 1930's had to offer. Indeed, perhaps no American work of fiction fits the label of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; better than Steinbeck's wonderfully written and still highly controversial masterpiece of fiction.Set in the 1930's, in America's &quot;Dust Bowl,&quot; this is the tale of the Joad family, a large clan of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, and how they are forced into a decision to migrate to California. It's also the story of the many trials and sufferings that they endure during their long and harrowing journey.Forces of nature and the forces of economics have conspired to force the Joads off their farms. So, this proud, hard-working family, sells most of their worldly possessions in order to buy a run-down old jalopy. The whole family - Ma and Pa; Granma and Granpa; Tom (the oldest son, and an ex-convict recently paroled from prison); Al (Tom's younger brother); Uncle John (Pa's brother); Ruthie and Winfield (Ma and Pa's youngest children); the heavily pregnant Rose of Sharon (Tom's younger sister) and her husband Connie; and the Reverend Jim Casy (a family &quot;friend&quot;) - pack themselves, along with their essential goods, aboard their decrepit old vehicle, and depart for the &quot;promised land&quot; on America's west coast.The vast majority of this compelling novel tells the story of the Joads' plight while on the road. They are almost immediately confronted with the death of a loved one. This compounds their grief at the loss of their home and possessions. They find that most people they meet along the way despise, reject, and vilify them as dirty, filthy &quot;Okies;&quot; they receive aid and comfort from very few along their route. Yet, they remain undaunted; throughout their struggles, they remain focused on the ultimate realization of a dream: jobs, high pay, and a new life in California.The great climax of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; sees the Joads once again suffering in unspeakable squalor as they attempt to survive the violent forces of nature and humanity in this, the great western &quot;promised land.&quot;The basic plot of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is exciting, suspenseful, gripping, and possessed with a terrible beauty. It is written perhaps in the finest traditions of the early twentieth century &quot;muckraking&quot; novels, exposing, as it does, the worst societal ills that were prevalent in American society of the 1930's.This book serves as Steinbeck's soapbox, as he deplores the exploitation of California's migrant workers during this era. Indeed, the author is frequently barely able to contain his moral outrage at the sufferings of thousands of &quot;Okies,&quot; and their often violent treatment by landowners, businessmen, and even law enforcement officials.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; abounds with wonderful character studies. The effects of indescribable suffering and abject poverty give Ma Joad the steel to evolve from her traditional role as a silent, obedient wife to become the true leader of the family. Conversely, Pa Joad's traditional role seems to diminish; he recognizes the fact, and, after only brief resistance, he defers to his wife's new role. Tom, ever so careful not to do anything to jeopardize his parole at the outset, finds himself increasingly outraged at his family's plight, and emboldened to action as a result.This novel's central theme is still as relevant today as it was in 1939: the growing disparity between the &quot;haves&quot; - the rich - and the &quot;have nots&quot; - the poor. Perhaps this is the real reason why the book still generates such controversy. It holds a mirror up to us, and forces us to confront some unpleasant truths that we, as an &quot;enlightened&quot; society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"If you have not read this book, what are you waiting for? Is it because it was written before you were born? (1939) Does its name scare you, as it did me, into imagining it would be about all sorts of odd things, as I did? Well don't let your preconceived notions fool you. It's a terrific novel. It is a great piece of literature that won Mr. Steinbeck a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, and eventually, with his other contributions to literature, earned him a Nobel Prize.What can I say about the Joads that has not already been said in the past sixty-odd years? How could I have missed knowing them earlier? I read this story, with its \\"country speech\\" and \\"country ways\\" and wanted to take them all in. I wanted to comfort them all. I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home. Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail? He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have. Then you meet the 'fambly.' You live with the 'fambly.' You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration. This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land. The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family. It fed them, it housed them. They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before. When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave. Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now. Imagine the dread. All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \\"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\\" No talking back, everyone knew their place. And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California. Along with 500,000 other displaced people. All looking for land to work; it's all they know. You get land, you work it, it's yours. They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really going to be like.There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong. She's the backbone. She eventually takes charge, which, back on their farm, was unheard of. Times were changing.Ma & Pa, 6 kids, Grandma & Grandpa, Uncle John, the Preacher Casey, and Connie, the husband of one of Ma's daughters. Thirteen people in one truck.I wanted to bring them home, let them eat, give them a hot bath, tell them it'll be ok. I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph. I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like. She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7. I saw humanity at its worse. Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. These \\"Okies\\" were treated with contempt. They were kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting. How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?It's a terrific book. I wish I knew how Noah fared. I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie. Is Tom ok? Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him? I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong. If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on. The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying. The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free. The food thrown in rivers, with armed guards making sure no one took the food. Pigs slaughtered because they could not sell them, and hungry people staring, not understanding that there's a profit to be made.\\"And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listening to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I don't know if I can adequately express how wonderful I think this book is. Steinbeck writes with incredibly vivid imagery and passion in all his books but this is his best and affected me the most.Grapes absolutely should be required reading, not only because it is Steinbeck or excellent literature but because it is a powerful story of human nature, social conscience, prejudice and classism. This book opened my eyes to the plight of yet one more minority group, migrant farm workers. I cannot drive by fields filled with people picking our fruits and vegetables without thinking of this book and the lives of these folks. Thank God for people like Cesar Chavez and the union he created to help. But I digress....This is a heart-wrenching, sad story of a family's search for relief from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma and a better life in California. The better life doesn't come by the end of the book but the reader is left a more compassionate person. Quite an accomplishment. Thank you Mr. Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Detractors of this novel will tell you that The Grapes of Wrath is melodramatic, contrived, and relentlessly preachy - and I can't argue with them. The Grapes of Wrath is overwrought and about as subtle as a hand grenade, but it is also a powerfully affecting novel. I challenge even the most cynical reader not to be moved (at least a little) by the tragic story of the Joad family.The novel is often described as a \`sweeping epic' (which means it is longer than the average book). It is undeniably a classic and well worth reading, but is not without its flaws. The novel is compelling and I found myself having trouble putting it down as I neared the final chapters, however it does get bogged down in spots and some of the dialogue is repetitive. Steinbeck is unquestionably one of the most important writers of the 20th century, but (and let's be honest here) his prose is largely unremarkable (certainly when compared to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\").And then there are the politics...Personally, I don't have a problem with an author having a strong point of view and expressing it in a novel. Yes, Steinbeck portrays a complex issue as if it were clear-cut. He portrays the migrants as good and noble (the men-folk may behave badly at times; drinkin', brawlin', and womanizin' but they are inherently good). Meanwhile, the banks and the land owners are evil personified. There is no middle ground in The Grapes of Wrath.Despite what some reviewers would have you believe, The Grapes of Wrath is not a communist manifesto. It does however, question how a country so plentiful can allow so many to starve and suffer and Steinbeck doesn't hesitate to point his finger at those he feels are to blame. Reality is considerably more complex. The plight of the dustbowl farmers was inevitable as the economy changed and small family farms became unsustainable.Steinbeck's narrative alternates between the Joad family's story (the even numbered chapters), and a series of expository chapters (the odd numbered chapters) that provide a broader perspective of the migrant experience. These expository chapters are the most politically charged and blatantly biased of the novel, but they also feature some of the best writing.My review sounds mixed because I have mixed feelings about the novel. It is bold, but contrived, compelling, yet melodramatic, powerful, but preachy. All in all though its strengths outweigh its shortcomings. The Grapes of Wrath is well worth reading, just don't set your expectations too high. This isn't one of the best novels ever written, in fact, it isn't even Steinbeck's best."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I first read this in high school- 40 some years ago- and I am still deeply moved by its power. Steinbeck never wrote highly polished prose and he liked plebian themes. It's easy to dismiss him, particularly if you think great novels must be word perfect or concern renowned people and events. In my second reading, Steinbeck's politics and philosophy came through more insistantly than I was aware of as a teenager.The 1930s federal government was as inept as present day FEMA. The police were as facistic as the Nazis. The banks and rich landowners were as greedy and grasping as Enron execs. The moralistic religious were as closed minded as Fallwell. The public was as whipped up over \\"Reds\\" as it is today over \\"terrorists\\". The heros are the Joads and other Oakies who have unlimited reserves of ambition, industry and resourcefulness, but by novel's end are reduced to questionable survival. You know they don't deserve their fate: people that eager to work, that loving and generous, that willing to improve the world should not end up destitute, hunted and starving.Since my first reading I have traveled the length of Route 66 and actually lived in some of the spots wherein the fictional Joads picked peaches. I've encountered numerous Oakies who made the trek and are proud of it. (By now, even the kids of the '30s are gray and choose to remember the best of times.) However, the hard times and nastiness in Grapes of Wrath is not a fabrication. Steinbeck researched the migrant camps extensively and came away with plenty of evidence and strong opinions. He chose to take the lowest point in his American history and expose its faults. In so doing, he also consecrated its common people. The novel also hints at themes that are currently more in vogue: agricultural ecology, the wisdom and strength of women, the need for new economics. America deserves a great novel for every era- this one nailed the dirty thirties."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Dylan Baker's extraordinary reading of Grapes of Wrath is amazing! The story, of course, is an all time classic, but what makes this special is the exacting impersonations of each character and the mournful tempo of the read.

Highly recommeded."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is of course an American Literary Masterpiece.

But in this case, The Grapes of Wrath deserves the label. Being forced to read this book through an assignment, I started off with a bad outlook. After finishing the book, I found that my opinion had changed. TGOW has a great mixture of history and plot while being written skillfully and wonderfully. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys the history of the Great Depression or Dust Bowl era; or to anyone researching biblical illusions in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a great book. I could hardly put it down.I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then. I was looking through some boxes and found the book. I read it every free moment I had. It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked. I felt very connected to the Joad family.I was pleased with the book up until the last page. I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters. I truly wanted to know what happened to them.Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"There are some authors that have so much talent that it is inhuman.

Although it does have an uncanny ending, I suggest you read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is John Steinbeck's finest work! It is truly a heart-breaking story. In The Grapes of Wrath you see capitalism at its worst, at its most hateful. The common man is nothing but scum. There is a lot of cussing in this book, which I did not appreciate, but that's Steinbeck. He is still a genius. The ending is a real shocker! I never dreamed it would end this way, and when it came, I couldn't believe it! It depicted, in no uncertain terms, the devastating, unspeakable hunger of a human being and the compassion of another human being in attempting to assuage that hunger. I saw the movie twice; once before I read the book, and then again after having read the book. The first time I saw the film, I thought it was great, but after having read the book, the second time I saw the movie, it just did not measure up at all; it was a real disappointment. I think Hollywood did a mediocre job of trying to bring The Grapes of Wrath to the big screen. It just didn't work, and of course the ending in the book couldn't possibly have been shown on the screen, not way back in those days, nor in these modern times of anything goes. It simply would not be possible. Is your curiosity aroused? Then read the book. The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a novel; it is a soul-searing experience!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck's chilling masterpiece about the American dream gone bad still resonates loudly and hauntingy today as it did sixty years ago. Police brutality, racism, and unfair labor practices still manage to take center stage and thwart the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness being entitled to everyone.The superhuman strength and will of Ma Joad will rudely wake you up from your slumber and inspire you to go out and make a difference. Steinbeck eloquently takes you on a lengthy journey of faith, hope, and despair that, at times, requires patience, but that patience will be rewarded a hundred times over.Through Ma Joad, Steinbeck hints that the world is a better place to live in and more conquerable if people saw outside their own families and became one big extended family. A practice that is sorely needed today as technology increasingly diminishes the human element.STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ENDING.In the greatest ending of a novel in American literature history, Rose of Sharon, who just delivered a stillborn child, offers her full breast to a hungry stranger in a barn. Steinbeck paints this beautiful picture of the ultimate act of human kindness with an amazing combination of power and poetry. This brilliant ending clinches &quot;Grapes&quot; as one of the greatest American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Overall, the novel was a very informative account of the historical aspect of the 1930s.

I read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; when I was seventeen. I am now forty two, and God knows how many books I have read to date. Yet, twenty five years after I first read it, if I were to be asked which is the best book that I ever read, I will have to say that this was it. The book just blew me away. I confess that I barely remember anything of its characters now. Tom and Rose Joad are a distant memory. Yet the magic lingers on. The book lies in my cupboard, but I am scared of reading it again, lest the magic may not be recreated. I will probably never read it again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful combination of great fiction and descriptive history.

After reading some of the reviews below, I get angry that people cannot grasp the effect the book has. YES, the depression was depressing, YES, there was a lot of description, YES, it might not make you feel really great about that time in America, but God, isn't that's what great literature is supposed to do- take you to a place you would never know about and tell you what it was like?

This book will challenge what you believe about America and make you realize thatnot all history books speak the truth. With a graceful , sad prose, Steinbeck brings to life characters as real and as alive as your friends and neighbors. I felt that I wanted a magical force to sweep me into this book and allow me to help the Joads and help fight the evil plantation owners, and only the best books make you do that. Simply put, this is must reading for anyone who lives in America , and even the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"John Steinbeck is the true American author. His use of symbolism and allegories in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; immerse the reader in the Joad's world. In my opinion, this is the greatest piece of American literature available today. The tragedy and heartbreak Steinbeck portrays can wrench your heart. His writing abilities are far beyond any author. If you need a good book to read, make it this one. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath is one of the few books whose &quot;classic&quot; status I agree with. His descriptive writing is beautiful but not for everyone. For example, one chapter is dedicated exclusively to the description of a turtle crossing a road. Reading on, one discovers that this was in fact an allegory to the life of the Joad family. The book is filled with allegory and allusion. Despite its use of figurative devices, I don't think this book has to be studied in order to be enjoyed. For a long trip or a secluded vacation, this book is excellent."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Grapes of wrath , simply put is one of the greatest stories ever penned by Steinbeck .

If you really want to challange your mind, read both then try to decide which theory you believe."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a book to be treasured...Steinbeck's weaving of storyline with the historical background of the dust bowl era served as an education for me. Just when you thought you were getting tired of all the additional background information, though, the plot kicks in to high gear. Following the life of the Joads was both emotional and suspenseful. The scenes were so vivid to me that I still can picture certain scenes in this book years after I finished it. One thing I found particularly intriguing about this book is the ending. You can read it all you want before you start the book, but understanding doesn't come until you've read the whole thing. I'm a huge Jack Kerouac fan, but I have to bow to Steinbeck, who showed me that spontaneous prose existed in a professional form before Kerouac and the Beats."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used.

Steinbeck captures the feel of the dustbowl and transports the reader to the era. The book is long, has many references to socialism, and ends somewhat abrubtly, however throughout the entire novel Steinbeck masterfully shows how life was for the poor during the depression. At the end I could only sit, stare at the wall, and thank God I was not alive during the depression. Then it occured to me that the book could be written today, not portraying the okies, but maybe Vietnam in the early 1970s, or Mexican migrant workers today. The book is a hisorical account of what life was like, but it still rings true today.Afterwards I read two more Steinbeck novels: In Dubious Battle, and East of Eden. Both were excellent but neither carried the impact of The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck wrote a powerful novel that I think everyone should read. If you don't like it the first time, reread it ! until you understand it. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I thoroughly enjoy many of John Steinbeck's books. I truly recommend East of Eden and Of Mice and Men to anyone who hasn't read them. This book however I found very tedious, slow, and overall quite boring. I know it's a classic and all but really had a tough time getting through it and after all that work I really felt the conclusion left me hanging."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I have been reading and re-reading this book for last couple of weeks and haven't been able to get over it. The backdrop, the politics, the facts behind the fiction, are all a different world to me. Separated by several decades. Yet, there are factors that connect you straight to the book. Tom is a man who reminds you of someone you wanted to be in school after being expelled. Ma stands for strength in adversity. Pa for being an understanding human being.Amidst everything, the characters Steinbeck has created are ephemeral yet so touchingly representative of human strength and dignity. The language of the characters is also communicative of the understanding of the lot Steinbeck has wanted to portray. The Scriptures' discussion between Tom and Ma when she comes to ask him to go (and her understanding the fact that children, especially adoloscents are likely to make mistakes in the heat of the moment) has a stark resemblance to the discussion of Indian scriptures I have overheard travelling to my village. It makes you wonder about the irony that when you are engrossed in reading such stories in fiction, you get appalled. But when you are just skipping through the newspapers, you miss the stories. There are quite a few Joads living out there, but we do not have the time to read through the stories in between the lines of the news columns.To sum it up, Grapes of Wrath is like a huge picture on a very large canvass that portrays the human life with a perspective that is way larger than we choose to adopt towards life. A must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a Junior AP English student, I was bombarded with summer work, and my assignments included chosing a summer book to read from a selected list. I chose the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck, and was immeadiatly captured in the sad story of the Joads and there turbulent Oddessy. Sad and depressing yes, but hopeless it is not; if anything this book is about hope and compassion and empathy for others, and for many of us, including the characters in this novel, that is a lesson learned the hard way. There will probably never be a writer as talented as John Steinbeck; he has a way of making you not only imagine, but feel what is happening in his story. Steinbeck uses his great skill to show both great beauty and harsh reality, and I hope at the time this book was published that it caused political uproar and brought the people in American aristocracy down to Earth to realize what was occurring. Although people moving from Oklahoma to California are the least of our great nation's worries, the thoughts expressed in this book have the power to open the eyes of Americans to many troubling situations that exist today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book is probably the most influential book that I've ever read. It has truly opened my eyes to a different time to help me appreciate the life that I have, now. The story follows the Joad family; they are heading West, to California, after being kicked off of the land that they farmed and were sharecroppers on. The Joads have heard that California is fruitful, rich, and beautiful. What they don't know is that 300,000 people just like them are also heading West to the &quot;green pastures&quot;. Along the road, they battle death, hunger, and fatigue. When they get to California, they battle poverty, crooked authorities, and hunger. The family struggles to find work and find a decent place to camp. The story has varying chapters. One chapter is a generalization of what is happening at each stage of the migrants' journies. These chapters use vivid descriptions, metaphors, and history to create a picture for the reader. The other chapters are specific to the Joad family with plenty of personal adventures and dialogue. With each new chapter comes more intrigue, hardache, and adversities. Excellent, emotional portrayal of this devastating time period. I would have liked if there was a little more closure at the end. The book is long as it is, but I was left wondering about some of the characters. I guess it's just one of those cravings, same with movies, when you never want it to end. Steinbeck has opened up a world, to me, that is begging to be delved into and researched. I can't wait to learn more about what I read.This book has really made me think about my life and the gratitude that I owe to everyone in my life. It's excellent to find that feeling of true thankfulness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a reader, I move pretty quick. I tend to devour books in weekends, or in some cases, overnight. It took me over two months to read Grapes of Wrath. And it was well worth the time invested. I can liken reading it to drinking a fine wine. You don't gulp, but savor. Enjoy. Relax.Steinbeck nailed it. He captured the flavor, feeling, behaviors, attitudes, societal woes, and speech of that era. The prose was beautiful, and the ending was extremely profound on so many different levels. A great novel will educate the reader in some way, or at least challenge their thinking about the world around them. This book did just that. I've heard the term &quot;Okies&quot; used a slur several times during my childhood, but never understood where it originated. Now, I do. Whenever I hear that term again, I will have an image ingrained in my mind of Americans, our brothers and sisters, searching for not just a new way of life, but FOR survival. I won't soon forget this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book sat and sat on my book shelf for years. Thinking it would be one of those &quot;classics&quot; that I &quot;should&quot; read I neglected it. One day I picked it up and found out the my fears were misplaced. It reads like any pleasurable popular fiction, with suspence, mystery and great characters, but it also goes beyond and delivers a powerful and heart wrenching message.How do &quot;we&quot; (those in power, those with wealth, those with land, those with plenty) choose to neglect &quot;them&quot; (powerless, poor, disenfranchised)????? This book isn't so much a look at political systems or an indictment against the rich, it really is a deep glare into the heart of man. And man's heart is often a dark and terrible place.What really makes this book great are the little victories, those things that made me the reader long for the great sense of love and community that followed the Joad family wherever they went.Sometimes a man's heart has been recreated, and when it has, nothing dark or evil can overcome."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The old style presentation of the Centennial Edition was not what I expected, but it works. The rough cut page edges are quite cool to look at, but the book (being new) holds together and has a shiny (sturdy) cover with fold out flaps to mark your place when reading ... so you get the best of both worlds - old and new - as you read. The old style theme of the book presentation also helps to set the scene (by \\"visually\\" taking you back in time). However, as you get into the story you realise you don't need this stage prop. Steinbeck is a master of words and describes the characters and events in such detail that you are there suffering with them, or enjoying the small happy moments they manage to grasp as the travel to California. This book was something we probably had to read as high school students and I somehow missed out. So, it is with great pleasure that I can do so now when I am older and am mature enough to realise what a tragic story it is and can understand the real history it portrays so realistically ... but in a way that you still don't want to put the book down.

The fact that there are currently some 445 other Amazon reviews out there (almost all ravingly positive) attests to the universal power of this novel. So, I'll just submit my humble little offering to this Grapes of Wrath shrine with 5 stars, and a caveat:The Grapes of Wrath is long-winded, and slightly &quot;boring&quot;. However, that said, don't be put off, it's actually hard to put down and reads relatively quickly. The style of writing matches the content perfectly, and if you read it at long stretches you'll find yourself rhythmically attached to the story. The long, drawn out narrative is meant to coincide very neatly with the long, depressing hardships the Joads face on their journey to California. What happens to them along the way, and how Steinbeck chronicles different aspects of 1930's America in alternating chapters is what makes Steinbeck an artist here. I don't think Steinbeck had quite reached the artistic capacity to create as vividly unique characters as he later does in Cannery Row &amp; Sweet Thursday, but again, The Grapes of Wrath is larger than specific characters, and Tom Joad isn't simply some displaced Oakie, but rather, he is a &quot;spirit&quot; that thankfully, refuses to die. This novel is as much history as it is a good story.At times you will feel indignant over how our country treated these people, and over the thoughtlessness of it's economic policies during the depression era. And you will probably find just as ugly parallels today in the arenas of civil rights, education, social welfare, tax reform, and so on. Thus, Steinbeck has created for posterity an American &quot;ghost&quot; which continues to haunt us. An American classic, on the &quot;dark side&quot;.If you're so inclined, Steinbeck kept a journal during the writing of this novel, titled, &quot;Working Days&quot; which I highly recommend for further insight into this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I'm shocked I was never forced to read it in High School.

John Steinbeck takes the readers on an emotional roller coaster as each chapter introduces new twists and turns hooking the reader and bringing them in. Throughout their endeavors the characters seem to transform and take on new roles; whether it be a desperate man trying to forget the past, live in the present and move into the future, a hopeless reverend striving to find meaning and holiness in life or a husband coping with failure and the fact that he cannot support let alone take care of his family without the strength and guidance of his wife. The Grapes of wrath focuses on family ties and humanities need of relationships and companionship.The novel is centered around one of the themes concentrated on this semester; the person's fear of loneliness as well as inability to be content with solitude and constant need of interaction and new relationships with that of other persons. This theme is very evident throughout the novel from the very beginning with the quickly evolving comradeship of Tom Joad and \\"Reverend\\" Jim Casey. The men find each other in the desolate and barren environment, which at one point had been a thriving community. Each man is in search of something; for Tom it is his home and family that he has been away from for four years and in Casey's case he is on a spiritual endeavor in the hope of finding holiness and renewing his faith. The two men find comfort and consolation with their camaraderie. The theme repeatedly presents itself in various situations for instance: the relationship the Joad's family forms with the Wilson's while venturing to California in hope of a promising new beginning, the effort of uniting the migrant workers against the intolerable working conditions they are forced to cope with initiated by Casey and finished by Tom Joad, and the last scene in the book in which Rose of Sharon saves the life of a man starving to death with her own breast milk. The Grapes of Wrath is an incredible as well as realistic tale of the ability to mend a desperate soul with the love and solidarity of another."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Considering the age I was (12 years old) when I first read this book, I should probably be somewhat hesitant in giving my frank opinion about it. I imagine many older readers with affectionate emotions attached to this book would have a thing or two to say about my rating. Either way, I should enjoy recalling what my personal experience was like with this interesting piece.Steinbeck is a brilliant author. No need to deny that. He has written many different works that both the young and old can enjoy and contemplate on. I believe Grapes of Wrath may have been on of them. I gave this a 3 stars although I would've preferred a 3 1/2.This book was somewhat long and a bit slow-paced for me. Yet, luckily, it managed to barely hold my attention with a calming and vaguely melancholy air. It is definitely not a read if you were looking for tragedy and disaster and bucketfuls of tears by your bedside. Instead, Steinbeck tends to sneak in touches of bittersweet passages and theme that mingles with the smooth flow of the words. It certainly describes the lives of the common family during the Great Depression and I suggest it for educational purposes as well.I find that most books its length would have to be pretty catching to make me read through it and Grapes of Wrath did manage to do that. I probably would've rated it higher had I not had the experience of reading a book of comparable length (Helter Skelter) and seen how much more I could enjoy one . But I have, and it has made it evident that this classic was not satisfying enough to my tastes. It is a neutral opinion overall, that really depends on what kind of person you are or what kind of book you aim to read. I do suggest you read it at least once but perhaps you might want to try it out at a library before you actually invest and buy it. It might be a while before you feel like reading again as it likes to describe somewhat similar things or events that makes the whole book blend together into a blurry illusion. The ending was not particularily enjoyable for me, either. I admit that I am the kind of person that likes a clear, stable, and satisfactory finale which leaves me thinking &quot;Yes, that's right. All is said and done and as it should be.&quot; Grapes of Wrath might leave you in a bit of a fluster after ending a bit abruptly and mysteriously.Still, it is generally an enjoyable book and I wouldn't advise a person to avoid it. I think many of you will find that you can develop quite a few opinions about it depending on your mood. I enjoyed it in it's own way and I presume the majority of others will be able to, too."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This story is a foundation of \\"modern classic literature\\". It not only tells the story of an idividual family, but paints a picutre of an era as a whole, and more than that; speaks to the humanity in everyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck was a red, and this book is infused with politics; but, unlike Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine work of literature. Not perfect, not without flaws, not as good as Zola's similarly-themed Germinal, but still a classic achievement by a truly great American author. Everyone should read it, from socialists to Shriners, and, as with any work of fiction, take it cum grano salis.Steinbeck didn't like capitalism, because, especially during the Depression, there were many things about it not to like. His prediction that the private ownership of the means of production was soon to be over (as of 1939) hasn't been borne out...but the guy is not remembered for being a commie pantywaist, or a spectacularly-wrong prognosticator.He was a writer, an exceptional one, and most people claim this is his best book. (I would argue that Of Mice and Men holds that distinction, but Grapes is almost five times as long...and how can a six-hundred-page book be worse'n a novella?)Whatever you think, about politics, economics, or literature, this book is not a waste of time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I personally have read a majority of John Steinbeck's works, and I've found that the more popular the piece happens to be, the worse the piece is. The Grapes of Wrath is certainly no exception to this. The characters in the novel tend to be rather unamusing compared to some of Steinbeck's others, and they very often do things without any sort of reason. The plot is rather bland as well, with the action mostly repetitive through the majority of the novel. The novel also includes many irrelevant scenes that does not pertain to the story or its characters itself. The reason for this is mainly that Steinbeck designed this novel to be more of an illustration of the Great Depression than a story. To be fair, though, as a depiction of the Depression, this novel is great, showing all of those scenes which are unrelated to the characters that illustrate other aspects of the Depression that they do not encounter. If you are looking for a novel that will give you some of the attitudes of tenant farmers and others during the Depression, then this is certainly your book. However, if you happen to be more like myself, simply looking for an interesting story, you would be better advised to look elsewhere. Perhaps one of Steinbeck's lesser known works, like Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, or East of Eden, which are all wonderful novels, even though they are often overlooked."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I can go to a used book store and find this book for $2 or so. It is ridiculous to charge this much."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I've been re-reading some the books I read 40-50 years ago. Some were required reading, others not. Many read better after you have more life experience behind you. For example Dickens, Hemmingway, Twain. There are things in those books you simply couldn't see or understand when younger. Little of that applies to The Grapes of Wrath. Even setting aside the tedious political and economic navet&eacute; of the author, the treatment of the principle characters is condescending and stereotypical. They are cardboard Hollywood caricatures. Maybe that is why it was turned so successfully in to a movie.I have/had parents and grandparents with dust bowl and southern California connections to that period so I have real people with which to compare the characters in the book. Perhaps the disconnect between Steinbeck's imagination and real people I knew is why I can't suspend disbelief.In sum, the book is interesting from the point of view of literary history, but if you want a good read try one of authors listed earlier, or even Bronte or Austen if your taste runs that direction."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Does anyone have the Grapes of Wrath on Kindle?

It was also very hard to get in to. After I figured out how the Steinbeck was writing the novel, it became a bit easier. I thought that the Joad chapters were too long and could have been broken down to read easier. As a lover of historical/fiction, I thought this was a bad book because, although it portrayed an accurate storyline, it was just not written well. I would not suggest this book to anyone who does not have to read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Sorry Mr. Steinbeck. I didn't like this one. I had to read this book for my AP English class. Now you may think, since I am a teenager, I think all classics are bad. NOT TRUE. I read a lot of plays (I LOVE the Glass Menagerie) and I've just started Allen Ginsberg's autobio. However, I HATE HATE HATE this book!Let me tell you why. First of all, these poor people have SUCH BAD LUCK. I mean, you'd think that at least one good thing would happen to them within the entire novel. Not so. I mean, if this book were just a hundred pages longer, all of them would be dead. Also, Steinbeck managed to kill off the two best characters in the entire book: Grandma and Grandpa, while Rose of Sharon, possibly the most annoying character I have ever read about, remains alive and whining till the dreadful end. Also, Steinbeck uses a lot of sexual references that are kind of weird and not very enjoyable. For example, he talks about the tractors &quot;raping&quot; the land. Lastly, you'd think Steinbeck is an insane guy or something because whenever something gross happens he really gets into describing it somewhat graphically. He spends a good amount of the book describing, in great detail, a pig eating a baby, cleaning a dead rabbit, and a dead dog squashed flat on the ground."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature.

I felt like I was reading a history book instead of a reading book because for me, a book I'm reading for fun, should at least have a satisfing, if not happy, ending.

I would consider him one of my five favorite authors. I think East of Eden is one of my favorite books of all time. I especially like Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. I even liked The Wayward Bus.HOWEVER, having said that, I must say that I cannot handle The Grapes of Wrath. My tolerance for pain is not nearly high enough. I have to be honest - I've never actually read the entire book. It's much to difficult to read through the tears in my eyes. I am sure that it is, like most of his other novels, a well-written, fascinating account of the lives of some very interesting people. I simply cannot willingly subject myself to such abject despair. I read novels for enjoyment, and I don't enjoy the feeling of having my heart pulled apart piece by piece, page by page.Undoubtedly it is to Steinbeck's great credit that he is able to draw that kind of emotion out of a person through simple words on a page. Only one or two books have ever been able to move me in that way. Unfortunately, it is not a feeling I desire. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive.

All thirteen Joads pack up in one old truck and begin their journey on Highway 66 to California along with thousands of other families looking for any work. Their trip take them through the loss of five of their passengers for various reasons, bullying from cops, threats of starvation and no money, and even the death of their dog. Yet, there is some sunshine as they meet up with another family halfway through who become their travel mates for a while. As the Joads enter California, they eventually find refuge at a government camp for migrant families looking for work. However, their luck is minimal as they know they can't stay and continue on, looking for better work and wages. This brings them to their last stop in the novel which isn't any better than the last few. Steinbeck leaves the readers almost wishing they hadn't even read the book, because there is no solitude for either the Joads or the readers.I gave this novel two stars, because it did not appeal to me. The story itself was depressing; it starts out sad, gets worse, and ends even more sad than it started. The bad plot doesn't make the novel any better, either. The book is literally just about a family riding in a car, looking for work. Another big factor was the writing style. I don't know if this novel is an example of all of Steinback's writing, but only half the novel was actually about the Joad family. The chapters alternated between the Joad family story and a story about migrants in general. This approach wasn't appealing. I found the book to have a very slow start, and once it started moving along, the chapters about the migrants just seemed to be in the way, prolonging the story for nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you're a fan of Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"i'm very happy with this product. it shipped super fast, the book is in great shape. now on to reading!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"No problems with the book - great story.My issue is with the description of the condition of my copy which was purchased as a used book - this was listed as \\"Very Good\\" condition - which to me means some minor creasing on the spine and maybe a couple of minor marks on the pages.

I read The Grapes of Wrath in 8th grade for &quot;fun&quot; and re-read it this year for summer reading (i'm 16) and wasn't too fond of the book either time. I'm probably going to be lumped into the category of &quot;all the high schoolers who read it for english and didn't like it because their generation has attention-span problems,&quot; but, frankly, that's not true. I've read and loved such wordy books as The Scarlet Letter, each of Umberto Eco's tomes (essays indcluded), The Great Political Theories (volumes one and two, no less), among others.The Grapes of Wrath, though, was just boring. It's sort of like an old-school Saving Private Ryan - let's beat into our readers'/watchers' heads the horrors of a terrible time in our history. What comes from this are preachy stories without base because, ultimately, we realize they are fictional. There was no Tom Joad or Private Ryan. The Depression existed, yes, but none of these characters did.Why should this make a difference? The story is fiction, after all, right? The difference is that Steinbeck, as in almost all of his mediocre books, tries to make us, through deathly boring descriptions and symbols, that his characters really existed. Oh well. I guess people are going to keep on reading this, so what I say here doesn't really matter. Read it once, and regret you ever did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be to many people a triumph of American storytelling, but I found it to very stale and overwrought. This may be due solely to the fact that I do not enjoy Steinbeck's writing style, but I think it is also because he pushes the story to the limit, and in essence milks all of the entertaining qualities of his characters to death way before the story is over.While the Grapes of Wrath has several 'nuggets' of brilliance (my favorite one involving a Native American chief), they are so swamped in boring sub-plots and narratives that switch back and forth that the novel can hardly be considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 619 pages you hardly care what happens to the Joad family, just as long as the darn thing is over with.In short, while I hate to discourage those who think this book is a triumph of 'American perseverance', I have to say that if you really want to know about the Dust Bowl (which is actually a fascinating period in history) read a history book, not this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was of course, wonderful"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I'll give you good advice when deciding to buy this book : DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

The dust bowl was brought on by poor planning by poorlyeducated individuals, as is demonstrated by this finely crafted novel which allows the reader to follow closely the lives of many members of the Joad family and their traveling companions without the emotional involvement obtained by many novelists. Steinbeck did this for a reason; he wanted us to come away from the story able to see &quot;the big picture&quot; and managed this by layering in observational chapters between chapters of the Joad's travels. The Used Car Salesmen interchapter is a real eyeful and the allegorical adventures of the Joads and Jim Casy will resonate in today's violent world of haves and have nots.

I found this story to be a page-turner and very absorbing. Excellent local color and superb character development. You know, I think today's younger generation could take a few lessons from this story - the stocism these people demonstrated throughout their ordeal was fascinating. The simply did what they had to do and only complained periodically (with exception of Rosasharn - who bitched and whined all the time). This is also a great review of a bleak period in American history.My advice to people who haven't read it is: by all means, read it, learn something about history and the human spirit.Now for the oddities:1. Maybe this was symbolic and I just glossed over it, but several times in the book, drivers (including the protagonists) are squashing with their vehicles animals who have the misfortune of using or crossing the road they use. Well, that was kind of strange I thought.2. Why Connie left Rosasharn is sort of a mystery. She was pregnant for crying out loud. Was her constant carping about her wanting a house and nice things just driving him bug-s---?3. Noah left and was never heard from again. I suppose you could argue that this was symbolic of a family disintegrating and how they dealt with it.4. Now the really odd thing. It ended at a weird spot. Not much closure.

In this remarkable novel we travel, suffer, laugh, cry, mourn and endure with the Joad family of Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The 455 page Penguin edition is nicely edited including footnotes and a useful introduction and bibliography of books about the novel and its author John Steinbeck.The Joads are forced to leave their home following a bank foreclosure. They decide to travel to California based on a handbill promising good jobs in the golden state. They ruefully discover that this is a false promise to induce hundreds of thousands to travel west so that the owners won't have to pay the workers a decent wage. The journey is analogous to the Hebrews slaves escape from Egyptian captivity as they sought out the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses in the bibilcal book of Exodus. Consider the affinities:1. 12 persons are in the Joad party as there were 12 tribes of Israel.2. The elderly grandparents grandpa and grandma Joad die before California is reached; similar to the death of Moses on Mount Horeb and the death of the exodus generation before Israel was settled.3. Water and the crossing of rivers is important in both Exodus and The Grapes of Wrath.The book has many memorable characters:Rose of Sharon-This Joad young woman is deserted by her husband Connie while she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she gives her breast filled with milk to a starving vagrant in a dank barn.Noah Joad is a mentally damaged Joad son who decides to stay by a river and fish instead of moving west with the family.Al Joad is the youngest Joad brother. He chases girls in all the camps the family stays in and keeps the beat up truck going down the road. As the novel ends he is engaged to be married to a fellow migrant girl of 16.The book abounds in minor characters which range from a determined turtle eager to reach his destination (much like the Joads are eager to reach the Golden State); slutty waitresses, burly truck drivers and fellow migrants suffering the slings and arrows of Depression era poverty. The language in The Grapes of Wrath is graphic, profane and based on the ungrammatical speech of poorly educated country people.The novel's title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from the second line of Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" The book is a battle cry for justice to the poor migrants of the 1930's. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is still a controversial novel since its publication in 1939. Interpretations and critical judgments vary. Read the book and decide for yourself! This is a great American classic every literate person should peruse. Outstanding in its gritty reality and compassion for the suffering multitudes!4. A dead baby is placed in a box and floats down a river in The Grapes of Wrath reminding one of Moses in the bullrushes.5. Natural disaster in The Grapes of Wrath are reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt in Exodus such as drought, floods and disease.There are other biblical resonances. Jim Casey (his initials are the same as Jesus Christ) is murdered by a mob for defending the poor and weak as Jesus was crucified on the cross. Tom Joad is a doubting Thomas figure and Uncle John with his insistence on sin reminds us of John the Baptist.The book is filled with memorable characters:Tom Joad-the prodigal son who murders a man in a fight and is sent to prison; later he will kill again in defense of Jim Casey. Tom was played with brilliance by Henry Fonda in the John Ford classic film \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"Ma Joad is the matriarch of the family. Tough and sentimental she holds the family together.Rose of Sharon-Deserted by her husband Connie she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she will give her breast to a man who is starving and needs milk.Ruthie and her brother are children.Noah is a mentally deficient Joad who leaves the family to live by a river.Tom Joad Sr. is somewhat weak and defers to Ma Joad in family decisions.Al is the young hot pants brother of Tom and Noah who is a good driver and keeps the truck going which transports the family to California.There are many memorable minor characters; destitute families, waitresses at the diners on the road; animals such as the turtle who symbolizes the determination of the Joads to cross the road and move forward; dogs and the animals of the night. The book is also exquisite in its portrait of the American landscape in the hardscrabble years of the 1930s. Steinbeck is a genius at reproducing how poor Americans talked at this time. The language is ungrammatical and laced with profanity and folk wisdom.The best place the Joads were able to stay was the Weedpatch federal camp based on one Steinbeck visited. The novel takes its title from Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" This book is a battle cry for justice for the poor and the need for Americans to work together to restore dignity and hope to the millions who were devastated by economic hard times.The Grapes of Wrath is a controversial novel with many interpretations being offered.

I, however, although a student and \\"forced\\" to read this book, beleive this novel, by John Steinbeck, to be a true classic of American literature. There are many other reviews below that give a far more indepth plot summary, so I will keep that portion of the reveiw succinct. The Joad family, suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, strap as many of their possesions as they can to their car and head west to the purported paradise of California. However, they find their paradise to be little more than a dystopia, run by the few plutocrats who have managed to stay afloat in the depression by standing on the shoulders of those below them. Steinbeck is nothing short of a master here, splicing \\"intercalaries\\" of heartbreaking human suffering into the Joad's comparable tale of woe and misery. This juxtaposition shows the extent of which the poverty and despair has blighted half a nation of farmers.Anyone who wishes to truly understand the human condition, its depths and its misery, should read this book. However, it should be noted that anyone looking for an uplifting tale of human tenacity should perhaps look elsewhere, for this novel is unrelenting in its depiction of destruction and despair.If I could give it 10 stars I would"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"What a great novel...i wasn't much of a reader in high school, but now that i have a child, i thought it best to see what i missed.

I waited for my mom to come to the store after security called her, imagining the anger she'd have in her face when she saw me and feeling shame, shame, shame. I didn't cry until she walked into the office and burst into tears, herself! Then I did, too. And on the way home, as I sobbed, she said things like, \\"I know, I know,\\" and \\"Shh...\\" Then she bought me a pineapple softserve ice cream cone at a drive-thru Mexican restaurant and took me home, where I laid in bed waiting for the sound of my dad's diesel engine and my impending doom.I thought of that while reading this book because Ma Joad, the strongest character I've met in a Steinbeck story, would tell her kids or her husband to hush when they started doubting themselves and their choices. She'd say something like, \\"Of course you did what you could! We all did. Everybody did what they could, so hush now, and peel these potatoes. Your pa and brothers need to eat!\\" Even her son who had killed somebody (in self-defense) was given a full pardon by Ma and told to just hush up about it! Of course you didn't put shame on the family! You did yer time, now hush!So, scrawny Ruthie Joad goes and tells a whopper of a family secret that changes things for everybody and puts an instant fear into the whole clan, including Ma, who gets wind of it from little Winfield. And Winfield says, hopefully, \\"Gonna whup her, Ma?\\" But no. She orders everyone to be quiet about it to Ruthie and not make her feel worse than she already does. When Ruthie shows up, she runs to her ma's middle and screams and cries into her belly. Ma knew, of course. Nobody can punish a person like him or herself. Just read the book and look at Uncle John, and you'll know it, too.Now, this book is not historical fiction--it's fiction from history. John Steinbeck wrote this book while all of the labor injustice was happening. Effigies of Steinbeck were burned all over California in protest over this revealing saga! He grew up in Salinas, well off, but idealistic. He spent his school vacations working in fields and on farms and listening, listening, listening to people's stories. He felt love and empathy for these people. He saw it as another Civil War for our country, but this time between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" which is why he used a phrase from a Civil War ballad as his title.Books about injustice and upheaval make me feel so anxious because they make me look at myself. My students read books about Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks, and they feel empowered. They say really lofty things about justice and rights and humanity and what was wrong, and what they would do. And I'm glad to hear them talk like that, but I get anxious during this sort of talk, too. I don't think I'd have been the one to stand up against anything. If I were there, I wouldn't have been picketing, facing violence! I'd have been hiding in my cabin, wishing everyone else would just go back to their cabins and work and stop causing trouble. People are likely to get their heads smashed in when they stand against power. And thank the Lord (Ma Joad's Lord, please, not Rosasharn's or Uncle John's) that there are people who will. Okay, enough about me and how I am no hero. It makes me feel squirmy.Though, maybe I'll find my cause. There was one thing that got to Ma Joad enough to shame her kids, and that was selfishness or self-pity. \\"It's not all about you, Rosasharn,\\" she says to her pregnant daughter. She tells her that if she were well and not with child, she'd give her a whop in the face for all that self-pity. She wanted her to understand that you can't be self-serving! You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was I great book in my opinion. It's the story of Tom Joad, out of prison and finds that his family is moving because they will push their house over because they cant afford it. Tom meets a former preacher Jim Casy and finds his parents. They head over to California picking up the Wilsons. This book showed me the Depression better than any history book could. I like the message it sent. I lke the former preacher's message of we can only believe in each other. And of course you probably know the famous speech from Tom Joad (...I'll be there&quot;).

Instead, once the dust blows away, we have post-Depression Oklahoma, and WWII, and today.The struggle of Joad is not just his struggle in a hard time, but the same perseverence through adversity faced by Carl Sandburg's characters in his &quot;Chicago Poems,&quot; in Dicken's &quot;Bleak House&quot; and in Billy Joel's song, &quot;Allentown.&quot; Tough times are universal, no matter the environment.Complex situations wrought hard decisions by Joad and his family. In these contexts, things seemed complex and heart-breaking --- and they were -- but no less are our difficulties today.

This seminal work transcends the fictional construction of it's impoverished family, as they suffer the loss of their elders on the journey to the promised land of migrant laborers, only to find their hopes dashed in the dwindling labor markets, and mounting hatred of California's equally impoverished population. This is Steinbeck's greatest creation, and a telling piece of Americana which affirms the indomitable spirit of those who experienced the worst era in modern history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"That THE GRAPES OF WRATH is a timeless classic is not news. It is one of those rare books that was recognized as genius from its initial publication and it has endured in popularity to this day. A staple of high school required reading lists, John Steinbeck's tale of displaced Okies hits the reader on so many levels that it bears repeated reading. The dialogue sparkles with depth and emotion.For those who are only familiar with THE GRAPES OF WRATH through the splendid movie with Henry Fonda, the book opens up even more vistas and provides a compelling view of Depression-era America. Through the eyes of Americans in a time of traumatic transition, John Steinbeck paints a lasting portrait of our culture and heritage."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a sobering account of the lives of a midwesterner family that takes place barely fifty years ago. What's even more sobering about it is that the general events in this story are true!Meet the Joad family --a hardworking Oklahomian family living happily on the farm they have lived on for years. *BAM* the Dust Bowl strikes and they are forced to sell their assets at a ridiculously low price and buy a cheap jalopy for a price twice as high as it should be. So this family does what most any families would have done if they were in this sort of situation: move to California, a place that promises great riches and prosperity. But when they get there, it quite the opposite (I don't want to give much away after this point).Really, everybody ought to read this classic. We must do everything we can to keep this part of American history from repeating itself.A great book on all accounts with great dialogue and a well-constructed storyline. A must read!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is one of the most enduring books i have ever read. The message Steinbeck was attempting to portray is just as relevant now as it was in the time the book was written.

It is a gripping, thought provoking and at times heart warming tale. Whilst the Joads are dealt blow after blow, the family stays together because that is all they have...quiet a lesson.

Just read the freaking story, without thinking about whether the author was a greedy politician or whatever. Tom- what a hunk! grapes was a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan. I love the majority of his work.Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book. I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only. It has not been influenced by what others think. I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book.I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book. What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get. People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc. This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read. And where is the plot? There isn't one. This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round. This book is a statement, that's for sure. Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement. I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently. I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country. That is wrong. I don't feel that way. I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises. None. Not like \\"Of Mice And Men\\" or \\"East Of Eden\\" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck. Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book. If you've read his bio you must read \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\" to understand why Californians hated him so much. In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book. One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\". Go figure."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The difficult lives of the Joad family during the Great Depression of the 1930's are very relevant to the America of today. The transition of the 1930's economy in the Midwest to mechanization is similar to the current transitional economy in the U.S., where we are moving from manufacturing to more of a tech base. We are moving away from what we know to something we don't know, and people are not sure what to do or what to make of it.I have loved the Steinbeck books I have read up to this point (Travels With Charley, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row), but Grapes is much too one sided for me. In typical Steinbeck fashion he puts you right into the story, but he paints with much too broad a brush here. It is slanted, and does not give equal time to both sides. The bad is too bad and the good is too good. Steinbeck seems to leave out a basic understanding of economics, perhaps intentionally, and I'm afraid lots of people just swallow the anti-corporate message without thinking. Some think companies are an unending fountain of money. They are not. Education is the problem, as it was then and continues to be.The Grapes of Wrath brought to light many things that needed changing in the United States of the 1930's, and for that I give it credit. Illegal monopolies, unfair labor practices, corrupt local officials, etc. are all effectively criticized here by Steinbeck. The immigrating Joads, as legal U.S. citizens, have rights as citizens which should be protected.The character of Al, one of the Joad's sons, is a bright spot. Al is changing and embracing the future by learning to work on cars, even after the mechanization has forced the Joads out of their sharecropped farm. The Great Depression forced people to move and to change, developing new skills as the economy changed. Al's forward-thinking adaptation made me wonder if the government relief mentioned in the book simply enables people to sit right where they are when things change and simply cash a government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way. I am afraid this type of thinking so prevalent in modern society is teaching people to become dependent on the government (in exchange for votes) instead of going out and making their own opportunities.While reading The Grapes of Wrath I lost patience with Steinbeck's rhetoric in which corporations and the wealthy got that way by unjustly taking advantage of others. Even small businesses (restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc.) in the book are treated with contempt. Small businesses create jobs. Large corporations create jobs. Individuals who gamble their family's security and future by starting their own businesses create jobs. These are positive forces in the economy. The Government taking money away from these positive forces is a drain, which must be justified in one way or another.At times the Joad family is starving, but they balk at working for wages they deem are too low. You do what you have to do however, and the Joads end up working and eating. Companies don't get ahead by cheating people for very long, and The Grapes of Wrath effectively illustrates the labor abuses of that time. Reforms were made and things eventually got better for the workers as well as for the economy as a whole. It is how the Free Market works, for better or worse. The real challenge lies in dealing with the transitional economy and figuring out how to prosper in it. It is a cycle, and The Grapes of Wrath is timely today because we are in that same type of economic cycle in the U.S. right now. Rather than looking to The Grapes of Wrath for answers, however, maybe we should look to it instead to learn from our past mistakes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a book that I really did enjoy. A couple of years ago I took the trip west that they talked about in the book. I went with my uncle who actually grew up on the pan handle in Oklahoma and took route 66 to California. A book that he suggested that I should read was The Grapes of Wrath. At first glance I did not want to just because of the size of the book. But I really wanted to see why he thought this book was so good. While reading the book I could really understand what the characters were going through. My uncle still has relatives in Oklahoma and we went to visit them on their farm. Comparing them to the characters in the book, I would say that the farming in that state has not gotten any better. My uncles' childhood home had fallen to the ground, and it just showed me how everyone really did just pack all that they had and left. John Steinbeck really emphasized the emotions that the Joad family went through. What kept me reading was wanting to know how the next leg of their journey would be and if I had been where Steinbeck was talking about. I felt like while the Joad family traveled through each state on their way to California I could relate to the same adventure. I remember going through Arizona and feeling the dry heat in the desert, or stopping at a Now that there are only pieces of route 66 left I could not get the whole affect of taking their trip, but I feel that I have taken a trip with the Joads now.

Although the book went off topic in a couple of chapters, the story got interesting towards the end. I admit it was a little dull at the start but then it captivated me by the middle of the story. The book teaches us that many issues from long ago still trouble us today and that everything that shines isn't gold. Steinbeck does an exceptional on describing the situations that many \\"oakies\\" or migrants from Oklahoma face on their fight for survival in the hostile land of California.The Grapes of Wrath may not be the best book ever but its not the worse.

He tended to be unpopular among his peer group because he became a champion of the poor working class. This novel is about migrant farm workers, in particular one family who are refugees from the Dust Bowl.The novel details the family's stuggle to survive under difficult conditions. High unemployment provides a surplus of labor which farm and orchard owners can exploit, paying them as little as possible, and gouging them further with high prices at the \\"company stores.\\" Attempts by workers to advance themselves were held down. The law is on the side of the landowners. It was an era when workers were easy to replace so little thought was given to their safety and welfare.This was an era that gave rise to labor unions, and open warfare between employers and unions.

He later received the Nobel Prize in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The farming-belt of the mid-west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold the family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I loved it!

It basically describes the tragedy of the Oklahoma sandstorms. The first section of the book is nothing more than a very detailed chapter, describing the sandstorms and the lives of the people living in Oklahoma at this period of time. Steinbeck does a great job at describing the miserable life of these people. I thought this was an essential part of the book because it set the mood of the book. It showed the reader, right away, what was going on in the world, and how horrible it was, before he gets into the characters of the story.During this horrible time, a family decides to leave Oklahoma like every other family was. They decide to travel to California in search for some fortune from the Gold Rush. Their trip is very long and harsh. They all travel across the country with a carriage and a couple of horses. They experience a lot of hardships on their journey. Close to the end of their trip a family member dies because of a disease in their foot. When the family finally gets to California they are expecting an easy life and they are expecting happiness but all they find is more poverty, like in Oklahoma. Nothing was different.This is the part of the book when I finally realized the family's pain. I finally started to feel really bad for them. This is a huge reason why I loved this book. Towards the end of the book I had serious feelings for the characters. It amazed me.The Grapes of Wrath doesn't have a very complex plot. It actually doesn't have much of a plot at all. It simply follows a family through a period of their life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"My favorite book. Simple.

He is not a master of the language as say, Dickens, but that is why he is so brilliant. I feel like I'm right there with the Joads. I've read this book three times in a year, and I always love it. Steinbeck's writing is so simple, you feel like you are listening to your grandpa tell a story. His initial description of Grandpa is hilarious! I love how he changes back and forth between the Joads and the scenes of the other migrant farmers. Two scenes really stick out in my mind. The car dealer and the trucker diner. Steinbeck's style makes you feel like you're in the diner right next to Al.Steinbeck's characters are simple, static,and one dimensional, but this works for this book.

I believe this book has changed something inside me I just cannot explain right now. The wounds are too fresh. I could almost feel this book move in my hands as I held it and read it. Please, ignore the political rhetoric surrounding this book by critics who see the book as socialist propoganda. I ask you as you read it to put yourself in their shoes! What would you do, and how would you react?I can honestly say I am of no political persuasion so it was easy for me to relate to the Joads' frustrations of identity. Although we have it better these days, these days are not looking bright. It would benefit anyone with care and concern for each other to read this important novel (I think, the MOST important novel ever written).For some who could not find a plot, consider this: The only plot in life we are guaranteed is the one they lay our body in when we die. I believe if you look past all of the biased political criticisms about this wonderful book you will see Steinbeck only attempted to show survival during the Dustbowl era depended upon help from each other; and that is only just skimming the surface.

Having lost their land to creditors and pressed to vacate, the Joads watch helplessly as land held by their family for repeated generations is unceremoniously uprooted and industrialized. With little left to their name, the dispossessed Joads set off on a westward journey in search of a better life. On the road they are joined by many thousands making the same trek, and soon new connections and kinships are formed. Their journey consists of hardships, deprivations, and death, pushing the Joads to their outer limits of endurance. However formidable their journey to California was, their toughest challenges still lie in wait beyond the Mojave Desert...Brilliantly woven, John Steinbeck's novel is a must read. I found it both inspiring and depressing; capable of imposing both grief and hope simultaneously. The Joads tragic losses will have you mournful one moment, while the next will find you filled with a hope that their undying resilience inspires.READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The second Steinbeck book that I've read as an adult, and probably one of the best books I've ever read. I had no idea California was so messed up until I read it. Unlike some modern readers who may complain about the alternating chapters, one dealing with plot and the other with seemingly irrelevant information, I thought that they added a lot to the book and gave it the feeling that there was more to it than just the story of one family.

I'd never read Grapes of Wrath for school, like most people, I figured it was about time. Having high hopes, I was a little disappointed. I did not like it nearly as the other Steinbeck's I'd read. But, still the overall work makes an amazing piece of history, fiction and memorable tale. Personally, I think it's highly relevent at this period in time with what our country is going through.Mainly, this book was a little tough to keep reading on, as the story didn't immediately grip me. I was about half way through before I really got into it. Before I really began to care about the characters and get where this novel was going or what it was trying to convey. Yet there were times when I'd just sit back and slowly read a page and take in the beauty of what was written.I did give it 4 stars because I think the writing, the story that it tells about the Oklahoma farmers & migrant farmers and the symbolism was phenominal! To me this book tells the story of our history, one that is important to tell and remember. There's a reason it won the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a scathing look at the Dustbowl era, with its mass migration of displaced farmers out of the plains and towards the vague promise of the Californian coast. The chapters of the work alternate between long episodes detailing the journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California, and short sections written from a more abstract point-of-view, about characters un-named. Though the work is over six-hundred pages, it roars through your head as fast as any book can, with Steinbeck's fury over the plight of the migrants bursting from every page.I doubt anyone can read this work and not feel pity for the Joads, and the real men and women that Steinbeck drew these characters from. On the other hand, I felt that Steinbeck did not adequately explain the situation from the other side. It too often seems that the troubles of the migrants stem from the greed of some heartless monster, rather than a honest person who has troubles of their own. Sometimes, bad things happen and no one is to blame. Steinbeck seems to forget this.Overall, this is still a classic work of American literature, both for its beautiful prose and intensely important reminder of how things were not all that long ago, and how far we have come since."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Quite simply, The Grapes of Wrath is THE Great American Novel.This is the powerful story of the Joad family, &quot;Okies&quot; who are forced from their bank-foreclosed farm during the depression.John Steinbeck's writing is sheer literary art. There is beautiful description, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a compelling story that captures the heart and seeks out the very core of one's conscious. And the beauty of it is that it's thoroughly understandable. The eloquent writing and flawless story can be savored by anyone from a junior high school student to a PhD.The book is also innovative, intertwining short chapters that capture the plight of the dispossessed with longer chapters that follow the long road traveled by the Joad family to California. This is accomplished without at all disrupting the flow of the story.No wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was the key work cited for Mr. Steinbeck's Nobel Prize.It's a mighty piece of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is one of the few works of fiction that is truly heart-wretching, that is capable of bringing people to tears. Not only that, but although it is a work of fiction, it is a truly believeable story, and not only COULD it happen, but it DID, many times over. Many families went along a similar route to the Joads during the depression and the Dust Bowl. That is why this book leaves such a profound impact on people, it tells us a little bit more about ourselves than we maybe want to know.Being from Oklahoma, this story really hit home for me. There is a part where the Joads are trying to head North, away from Hooverville, and they are stopped, the policeman tells Tom &quot;We don't want you goddamn Okies here&quot;. Tom wants to hit the man with a jack, but Ma won't let him, and he, stone cold Tom Joad, cries. This is a moving scene, and there are many such ones in the book.

Steinbeck makes the life of migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they were up against in the 30's.Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need. If we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different, or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will come our way.A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and perfectly placed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I must have read Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; a half dozen times since I first picked it up as a high school student. The story of the ongoing hope and determination of the displaced migrants, pitted against the disdainful land-owners, highlights a 20th century conflict between traditional values of inherent virtue and the interests of business, economic efficiency, and the profit-seeking wealthy. The first few times I read this story, I saw only a tract that promotes centralized state authority and socialist constructs as a solution to injustice and poverty, as also appears in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;. In my later years, however, I have seen Steinbeck's prophecy against the hypocrisy of those who would call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot;, then ignore the essential tenets of their faith to serve their own interests, the minute they've left church on Sunday. The book continues to speak to our own age, when the well-to-do in the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; competition of the modern marketplace find it all too convenient to neglect the poor that remain. Although history has since proven the value of a free-market economy, its &quot;winners&quot; are just as human as its &quot;losers&quot;, and cannot in good conscience brush them aside, discounting them as products of their own failings."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Oddly, I first read John Steinbeck's classic tale of the 1930's depression, Grapes of Wrath, as a result of listening to Woody Guthrie's also classic Dustbowl Ballads. In that album Woody sings/narrates the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they get the hell out of drought-stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California. After listening to that rendition I wanted to get the full story and Steinbeck did not fail me. His tightly-woven story stands as a very strong exposition of the plight of rural America as they tried to make sense of a vengeful God, unrelenting Nature and the down-side of the American dream. For those who have seem Walker Evans's and other photographers pictures of the Okies, Arkies, etc. of the period this is the story behind those forlorn, if stoic, faces.The story line is actually very simple. The land in Oklahoma was played out, the banks nevertheless were pressing for payment or threatening foreclosure and for the Joads, as for others, time had run out. In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start. With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams. Their struggle along the way is a modern day version of the struggles of the old Westward heading wagon trains-including the causalities. But, that is not the least of it. Apparently they had not read Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that the frontier was gone- the land was taken. The bulk of the story centers of what happened when they get to the golden land-and it is not pretty. Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem-you know, California, the real California of the day. Not the Chamber of Commerce version. In short, as Woody sang, no hope if you aint got the do re mi.Grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography. So here is the list. Listen to Woody sing the tale. Watch Henry Fonda to act it out. And by all means read Steinbeck. He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California. What happened to those people later and their influence on California culture and those who didn't make it are chronicled by others like Howard Fast and Nelson Algren. But for this period your man is Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"You have to read this book. It has been one of my favorites for the last 10 years and I often re-read it.While the Joad's story is definitely moving, I think the best parts of the book come from the narratives between the Joads story.Most people look at this book as a history of the Great Depression and how it affected the Dust Bowl in the 1930's in terms of the Joad family. I hope that people can remove themselves from the Joad story long enough to realize that Steinbeck's narratives exemplify the history of EVERY CLASS STRUGGLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN.Anyone who has ever studied revolutionist theory, be it the American Revolution, Civil Rights, Women's Right's, Gay rights, etc. cannot NOT appreciate the insights that John Steinbeck gives in the alternate chapters. It is unfortunate that most people won't bother to read this book because,a. it's a classic, and classic means \\"boring\\" andb. it may be about a group of people that are not at all interesting to them.As an Black-American, I see the looks of people when I say this is one of my favorite books (along with \\"Great Expectations\\" but that is just because Estella is a the kind of woman I admire), especially among other Black-Americans. I mean, who cares, we have CURRENT struggles in our midst. But to not read this book would be a mistake. This book is very relevant to what we currently face. And with the current immigrant situation, I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone illegally in American as well. This book is not about just the dust bowl in the late 1930's, it's about being strong in the face of adversity. It's about going when there is nothing left. It's about coming together for survival. It's about what causes change.Many people won't care about the Joads (although I don't know how you cannot - if Ma Joad doesn't remind you of the stereotypical strong black grandmother holding the family together - I don't know what does). But even if you don't, you can at least read the narrative chapters.Particular chapter favorites are:If you are not moved by the words in the above mentioned chapters, then you have never been on the other side of \\"the right\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A thousand years from now this book book will be in the Bible, like Job. ...

However, it did bother me that there was an entire chapter dedicated to the trials and tribulations of a turtle. It made a good point, but it was so long. And how long can one go on about dust? I realize it's the dustbowl, but some of Steinbeck's descriptions are a bit excessive.

It is true that there are more safety nets now for people, though some in our country are trying to get rid of these. As a result of the social legislation of the 1930's there is unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, protection of an individual's assets in banks that fail. Why would our legislators want to allow these to disappear to save a few bucks when they continue to rent public lands for exploration to huge pick companies @$5.00 an acre, same with mining rights to mining companies, depriving the US government from receiving justified revenue, no royalty rights???"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Amid the desperation of the 1930s Dust Bowl, drought and changing agricultural practices force a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers to leave their home and join the great migration to California. Piling their broken-down Hudson with the few possessions they can carry, the Joad family sets off for what they believe will be a paradise of bountiful fruit and plentiful work. When they arrive, enduring one hardship after another along the way, the California they find is not at all the one they imagined.Though a work of fiction, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a painfully real story of what can happen when profit is placed over concern for one's fellow human beings. Like the Mexican migrant workers of today, the Joads flee desperate circumstances in search of a better future, only to find exploitation at the hands of wealthy farm owners and resentment on the part of the people already settled there. Enticed by handbills telling of the need for workers, the Joads discover that the farm owners are merely flooding the market so the starved migrants will fight for the lowest wages. There are constant attempts to keep the migrants in a state of helpless docility: their cardboard Hoovervilles are periodically burned (under the guise of \\"public sanitation\\") to keep them from settling down, and any attempt to assert their rights can result in being blacklisted as a \\"Communist.\\" Meanwhile, they watch with simmering anger as perfectly good fruit is thrown away in order to keep prices up. The locals have little but fearful hostility for the people they derogatorily label \\"Okies,\\" whom they view as less than human.Despite their unending hardships, the Joad family pushes on with dogged perseverance, never losing their dignity. Even when the reader is tempted to lose hope, the Joads find the strength within themselves to push on.One of the strengths of the novel is its characters, who are simultaneously flawed and admirable. The protagonist, Tom, is on parole after unintentionally killing a man in a fight. He can only make the journey by breaking his parole and must not be discovered, which creates an undercurrent of tension. When Pa's status as the head of the family is weakened by his inability to support the clan, Ma emerges as the family's indestructible backbone and one of the strongest characters. Along for the journey is Reverend Casy, the reluctant preacher and a kind of Christ figure, whose philosophical ruminations provide much of the book's social commentary.It is ultimately the pregnant young Rose of Sharon who most embodies the story of loss, resilience, and renewal. Throughout the novel, she is an immature and emotionally fragile girl who seems defeated by the dashing of her dreams: her teenage husband, Connie, runs away, and her baby will be born into unbearable poverty. However, at the end she shows a tender heroism, and her actions in the book's final scene are powerful and unforgettable.This is a deeply moving book. You will grieve for the Joad family's tragedies, all the more because these tragedies are largely the result of human folly and greed. But you will also dream along with them, and find hope in their resilience and will to survive."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"As a former resident of California, I was often shocked on how the locals treated the Mexicans. After working all day, some were paid virtually nothing, and some were actually paid nothing. And because they couldn't complain to the government they were just \\"out of luck.\\" This book addresses that very issue, if only dealing with the white \\"oakies.\\" The point of this novel makes about migrant workers is just as valid today as it was 80 whatever years ago.Steinbecks writing is occasionally criticized, but I cannot figure out why. Steinbeck takes a quasi-journalistic approach to his writing, flawlessly fusing fiction and reporting throughout the writing. This is a book that is simultaneously interesting and informative. Its like a newspaper thats also entertaining. The writing is very fluid, and despite the novels length (my edition was over 600 pgs) its actually not a boring, slow read. The characters are well developed and interesting, if in some cases a tad unbelievable.A great novel.

Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about. Published in 1939, the Grapes of Wrath is about the brutal and sad time people had to live... shall we say struggle through... and for the lucky some... survive during those days.I learned that back then people entered into agricultural agreements where they did not own the land but were allowed by the owners to use the land in return for a share of the crop produced, and as times got really bad because of the lack of water, the \\"dust\\" storms and the inability to produce, they could no longer afford to pay the agreed share and were therefore, run from their land... even though they had worked it for over 70 years seeing many family generations come and go on the land which they called home...How incredibly sad... simply horrible... The story centers on a family with the last name of Joads and it is so hopeless at times that I felt the pain and sorrow of these characters daring to hope for a better life.Desperate times, children left without food and without care because parents earned miserable wages and had to go to find whatever work was available. Labor contracts were not respected, conditions were oppressive, and the spark of an attempt to correct the situation was seen as a crime and punished as such.The emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had. The road trip that takes them from their home in Oklahoma to California is at times exasperating because we suffer right along with these characters. The scenes at a road side diner where they buy bread... only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many. Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity. How can we live our lives in peace witnessing those who have so much and yet others not being able to eat? How do we ensure that our social systems protect our people from ever having to endure such harsh living conditions? At what point do we stop being human if we stand by and do nothing to change and bring opportunity and the right to work and earn a living to every person willing to work to make a living?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book will make you look around with open eyes.

Unfortunately I've discovered that there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to which books deserve to be on that list. Out of the three lists I've come upon only two books were even listed more than once (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" both by John Steinbeck), so I've been forced to read as many books as possible from all of the lists to try and compose my own.Based on the listings I suspected the \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was going to be a special book so I wanted to own the hardback copy of it, but since it has been out of print for so long I finally broke down and just bought the paperback. Let me just say that this is one of the best novels ever written and certainly will make my final listing. It definitely was deserving of the Nobel prize it received.Written in 1939 this book captures the story of the Joad family during the Great Depression when thousands of families left their farms in Oklahoma and moved out to California to try to improve their fortunes, only to find sorrow and death waiting for them there.The story opens with Tom Joad being released from prison on parole for a charge of murder he committed in self defense. He returns home after being away for several years only to find his family packing up and moving away. The crops hadn't been good for several seasons and the banks were foreclosing on the loans. Small farmers were being squeezed out by the big corporations and people were forced to try to find a different profession.When handbills arrive declaring that there was plenty of work out in California picking crops the people took it as a sign of hope. They sold most of their possessions, packed whatever was left up in a broken down truck and headed west on route 66.The Joad Family consisting of fourteen people and friends plus one dog, along with all of their belongings set out for the trip in just one truck that they bought from a very charismatic salesman and had customized. (I'm sorry but this was one of the few things in the story I had a problem with, since I just couldn't picture it. I'm one of seven kids and the nine of us could never fit in a station wagon. How did fourteen people and a dog fit in one truck with all of our belongings?) There was Mr. and Mrs. Joad, Grandma and Grandpa Joad, Uncle John, Casy the former preacher, the boys Noah, Tom, Al, and little Winfield, and then there was the daughter Rosasharon (Rose of Sharon) who was pregnant along with her husband Connie, Rosasharon's younger sister Ruthie, plus the dog...While home on the farm when there was work Mr. Joad and the men ran the family, but when they got out on the road without any work Mr. Joad became a lost without his purpose in life, and Mrs. Joad had to take over as the head of the family. She made all of the tough decisions on the road and showed her strength to keep everyone going. Uncle John is a dark soul who had never forgiven himself for not being able to do more for his wife when she got sick and died. He fluctuates in the novel between being a drunk and someone who gives away all of his possessions to the kids to try to make it up to the world. The oldest son Noah I believe is mentally challenged due to a birthing accident and is kind of lost with all of the changes. Tom who is the next oldest son represents justice and truth throughout the novel. Al is a tomcat who's always out looking for girls, but wants to settle down some day and be a mechanic. Rosasharon and Connie are a young couple who dream of owning their own home with a white picket fence and raising a family. Casy used to be a preacher but lost his belief in God. Out in California he discovers a new calling. The kids Winfield and Ruthie I believe just represent innocence.Along the road they live day to day, dollar to dollar with the belief that all they need to do is get to California and they would find salvation. They meet many adversities along the road which they struggle to overcome. By working together and making some new friends they manage to survive. The whole country seems to be moving and change is in the air. Route 66 is perfectly described, from the truck stop restaurants, to the broken down gas stations, we are shown different levels of haves and have nots. The Joads do a little better job than some in maintaining their moral standards and beliefs but they see the road take it's toll on the people.After many tragedies and tribulations they finally arrive in California only to find that they were mislead. California may be beautiful and the land fertile but it is all owned by greedy men, who don't want to share any of their wealth.A great number of people have been lured out west in order to produce a cheap labor force to pick crops. With thousands of people fighting for just a few jobs they would accept lower wages just to keep from starving. The people tried to turn to the government for help only to find more greed and corruption. The government would only grant assistance to people who had been in the state for more than a year and the police were all either related to or paid off by the wealthy land owners who wanted to maintain the cheap labor force, so they kept the people moving so they couldn't obtain any lasting residency.People were living in make shift homes on the edge of town called Hoovervilles (after Herbert Hoover, president 1929-1933), until the cops came and forced them out.Even in desperation the people still tried to ban together to create their own rules and maintain their basic morals for what was acceptable, but they were being plagued on at every turn. They still acted as men, but you could see their tolerance reach critical levels.Each chapter you could feel the tension rising as the people were beaten down and mistreated. It was hard to believe the level of cruelty. The rich were afraid of the poor people and thought they were going to take everything they owned so they treated them as less than human and gave them nothing. The poor could only turn to other poor people for help since no one else seemed to care. Throughout the book as the people reached a greater and greater level of desperation you wondered when they were going to break, but the human spirit seems to persevere.After all that transpires you are just amazed at the ability of these people to keep fighting and go on, and that gives you a little bit of hope.I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"An incredible tale of the aftermath of the Great Depression coupled with factory farming.Definitely in the top quarter of books I've read, my only complaint was in the ending - I'm not saying it should be different, it fits the story very well, but darn it I wanted to see a little more happiness in the end for a family that had struggled so.One of the top American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The next time somebody asks me what the Great American Novel is, I'm pointing them right here.

One can easily imagine Tom Joad or, more to the point, his sister Rosasharon saying it in her \\"sharing\\" scene in the closing pages of the book. I read this book, the first time, in sophomore study hall just before lunch in small town Wisconsin; largely as a result of the wretched deprivations depicted in the book, I remember rushing home, sure I would starve to death if I didn't immediately ingest the bowl of soup and sandwich my mother had waiting for me. As the Joad family move out of Dustbowl Oklahoma toward the promised land of California, the Joads must survive on fried dough and unripe fruit (from which they are warned they may \\"get the skitters\\"); Along the way they meet tragedy and, in most cases, their dreams of a better life are smashed like last year's fallen fruit...And, yet, they still hope for the best. Maybe the next Hooverville will be different, maybe the next fruit ranch; if they could only make it there. Government offered little or no help. Long before the rest of the nation hit the skids, farmers were getting the short end of the stick; they never saw any of the prosperity of the 1920's, and the Dustbowl didn't help either. But Tom Joad sees hope in numbers, \\"Wherever a guy is hungry, I'll be there...\\", he says, urging the readers to come along, to fight injustice wherever they can: a challenge as urgent today as when Tom made it in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"First introduced to John Steinbeck via \\"Grapes,\\" some thirty years ago, I've found myself a fan of his work ever since. This is no short read, but it is easy to follow and a great record of a period in American history when everything was falling to pieces.Basically the story of the Joad family as they migrate from the dust bowl in the thirties to California, it is intricate in its telling. The character development is especially rewarding and it would be impossible to read this great novel and not be moved by the extreme hardships that this family endured.There are only a handful of \\"great American novels,\\" and this is certainly at the top of the list. The only other Steinbeck that I enjoyed more was \\"East of Eden,\\" with its themes of family dysfunction and turn-of-the-century turmoil.Whether you're a fan of long novels or not, this is a must read book for anyone interested in great literature and seeking to know more about a period in American history that shaped our country. And finally, the ending, you simply won't believe. It's an incredible image of hope that will stick with you long after you've closed the covers on this incredible book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"'The Grapes of Wrath' is off the charts. I'm not qualified to review this book, but I'd like to make one observation. This masterpiece is the only book I've ever read that builds and builds until the very, very last word. Three words before the end I had no idea of the unutterable tenderness that followed. I will always remember how I felt at the moment I finished reading that last word. It was \\"Huh? No. Oh my God.

It's worth sticking with all 619 pages. With this book John Steinbeck discusses the Dust Bowl migration. It may seem as though this may be a boring topic for a book, but this novel is actually very interesting. Plus, it is a great read when studying about these hard times during history class. The book looks at the situation from two different angels. It first looks at the migration from the west to California from the eyes of the Joad family and then it looks at the situation from the eyes of any person who has lost everything and has to travel from the west to the east. The Grapes of Wrath touches on many different themes such as the suppression of man, and how man can pull together though hard times with wrath. Once you begin to read you really do get into it. I would have to recommend this book for teenagers on up. This is because there is some light language and I feel that a young adult would better be able to grasp all of the symbolism and meaning that this book encompasses."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most informational and interesting books I have ever read. It dates back to a time in which recent generations may not understand. The 1930's were a difficult time for a lot of people. The Joad family demonstrates the struggles of some of these people on their quest for life.The main character in this book is Tom Joad. He and his family leave their home in Oklahoma because they are pushed out by the banks and forced to move west. Their journey is like no other as they struggle to stay on the road and find money for food. Like the Joad's, thousands of other families are compelled to do the same. These families move in hopes to find a better life.The Grapes of Wrath is a one of a kind novel that widens a person's outlook on life. It shows the audacity and strength of families that have nothing to rely on, except each other. It demonstrates both sides of man; the cruelty and the love. John Steinbeck has filled this book with unforgettable characters that can only be seen through the eyes of the reader. The Grapes of Wrath is an outstanding book that brings to life the courage of mankind."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is the reason many people feel he is one of the best American authors of all time. This book is fantastic, there are no other ways around it. This is probably one of the best books he has put out in my opinion. The story is really good and it is really engrossing. The characters come to life and stay with you almost like old friends. He is such a good author that he describes the environment with such skill that you see everything. Once you start you will not want to stop."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I've always thought the best measure of art is how it moves someone emotionally. The Grapes of Wrath is a work of art that irradiates such movement.

It also has a VERY gripping ending. Highly recommended classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I've never known poverty.

Grapes of Wrath is timeless. When a 60 year-old novel can move a grown man to tears that is powerful. I won't spoil the ending, but I will simply say it is the most touching ending that I have ever read in a book, seen in a movie or heard in a song. I had to read the last page three times to really get the full effect. I have young children, this will be one of the first novels I will want them to read as teens. I think I would have been more compassionate and understanding in my teens and twenties if I had read this earlier. For years I have listed To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book. Hats off to Steinbeck, I've changed my mind and Grapes of Wrath is Simply the Best!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The first 16 pages of this novel really knows how to put a person to sleep. If you are in to analyzing characters in text to Biblical figures (aka Jesus Christ) then you'll like the preacher J. Casey. From their journey until they arrive in California is fairly accurate in giving you a description of what the life was like for these displaced farmers. You can see the developement of Ma Joad as she takes center stage in the family. As for the ending, it was rather odd how Rose of Sharon gave of herself after showing such selfishness and wistful dreaming. Overall, a very good piece of American Literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"well, i think there could not be enough said about how good the story is. Steinbecks classic is one that will make you feel emotions: sadness, pity, relief, and joy. The story based on the worker migrations to california is beyond a doubt a classic novel that MUST be read... enough about the book...the audio book is excellently read by david baker who reads with great clarity and pronunciation. it is unabridged so the listener will get the whole thing as it is. i had read the book twice already and was well on my way during my third pass through when i ran into the idea of listening to this. i had high expectations of the book's content, but was wary about the readers interpretations being thrown upon the reader. baker does a good job of not throwing out too much of his own interpretations/feelings into the words as he speaks them {and when he does they coincide with my interpretations/feelings}.the unabridged audio book is well worth the price. only thing is that audio books cannot compare to actually reading the book for yourself. even with the audio book, i often went back to the book to reread certain parts, and i recommend that everyone pick up the book too and read it... but the book being around 2 inches thick, and if you do not have time sometimes for reading it, the audio book is a good alternative!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinbeck's classic novel about the Joad family of Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a new life. The Joads are forced from their family farm due to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s. Once their farm becomes unproductive, it is foreclosed on by the bank and the Joads are left homeless. Steinbeck's classic is a depressingly honest look at the poorest socioeconomic class of the Depression. As the Joads move West to California and then try to assimilate themselves into a land where their kind is unwelcome, Steinbeck often pauses to observe the larger picture of the desperate circumstances of life for the common American of that era. The Grapes of Wrath is a beautifully written novel about an ugly side of life. While it is heart-breakingly sad, readers will appreciate it as a classic because it is so vividly real. I think most will come away from this story with a deep appreciation of where the United States has come from."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"After being assigned a novel project in Language Arts, I decided to read The Grapes of Wrath. This book is about a family, the Joads. They get kicked off their land and set out to California to look for a job. During this book you follow the Joads journey to California. They have to go through many obstacles on their way to California. As you read this book you will learn about the things that they have to go through. They have determination, and are very brave people. This book was a good book but sad because of all the thing that the Joads had to go through, and how hard that it would have been to live back then in the Great Depression. If you are looking for a good book to read about the past I recommend The Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Steinbeck is one of the best American author. He has a definite talent to tell a story and when you read the effort he went through to write this book, you learn to appreciate it even more, not that you won't appreciate it otherwise, but it's always nice to know the background of a certain book. The story he is telling probably happened more than a hundred times, that's why it is so powerful, because we know that it is true. That's what makes it a true American tragedy.The chapters in which he gives us the Joad's story are really compelling and interesting. But what really makes this book stand out above other is the even more powerful chapters where he tells the story without giving any names just for us to know that the Joads are not the only one in the samew situation.Even if this book is very long (600 pages or so), it is still very interesting with no straining and lowpoints.

This powerful novel vividly portrays a universal crisis of humankind, a crisis that remains as destructive today as when Steinbeck undertook to illuminate it for all those who dared to read. Massive disparity of wealth in a society is far more than an economic conundrum. It has the power to destroy self-images, families, and lives. It has the power to confuse honest laborers, to rouse them to helpless anger, and finally to sink them into abyssal despair.Industrialization drives sharecropper families from the land that they have tilled, harvested, bled upon, dropped sweat into, and been buried in for generations. Severed from the anchor they have always known, the families become wanderers, searching for a way and a place to survive. They become the \\"have nots\\" of American society, feared and shunned by the \\"haves.\\" Soulless land companies, banks, and agricultural industries are great, faceless controlling forces that exploit the landless and then drive them elsewhere. How do ignorant sharecroppers fight such exploitation? Mortals might as well take up arms against a malevolent deity. The totality of despair created by such an economic system can hardly be imagined by one who has not experienced it.Is there no way out? Steinbeck suggests that there is perhaps one hope. If the migrant poor will only stick together, cooperate and support one another in solidarity, create a union of workers, then the impersonal corporate giants must listen. If two hundred men speak as one, the voice becomes loud enough to demand fair and humane treatment. Easier said than done, especially when those who would speak of this aloud are jailed, beaten, and murdered by the giants' \\"hired guns.\\"This discussion suggests the essential difference between GRAPES OF WRATH and Steinbeck's other novels. The others paint struggles of mankind against the background of an amoral universe in which irony often distorts the outcome. This one paints struggles of the \\"common man\\" against profit-and-loss ledgers of the agricultural industry. It is brutal in its portrayal of how the \\"system\\" methodically destroys families, and it is equally brutal in its portrayal of the fear engendered in economically comfortable men by the influx of those who are in need. In the inevitable confrontation that follows, the veneer of civilization is replaced by stereotyping, then by hatred of the stereotype, and finally by repression of Americans by Americans.Yet, Steinbeck allows us to hope. After Casy, the canny former preacher who finds courage to lead a strike against inhumane treatment of workers, lies in the mud with his skull crushed, Tom Joad leaves his crumbling family, vowing to follow Casy's vision. Casy and Tom are our \\"Joe Hills\\":\\"The copper bosses killed you, Joe;They shot you, Joe\\" says I.\\"Takes more than guns to kill a man,\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"And standing there as big as lifeAnd smiling with his eyes,Says Joe, \\"What they can never killwent on to organize,went on to organize.\\"From San Diego up to Maine,in every mine and mill,where workingmen defend their rights,It's there you'll find Joe Hill,It's there you'll find Joe Hill!Now, who should read GRAPES OF WRATH? Is anyone concerned with the plight of the common workingman or woman? Is anyone concerned about the effects of industrial globalization? Is anyone concerned about the final impact of the \\"Wal-Martization\\" of America? Is anyone concerned when fertile fields lie fallow or, perhaps worse yet, are converted to barren asphalt-covered flats? If anyone cares, read the novel. If one is financially secure and therefore does not care about such things, then he especially should read the novel, for then maybe, just maybe, he will begin to care."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I recently had to read this novel for highschool, and it's one of the best books I've read. It's a pretty simple book with easy to understand symbols and themes, but it is written perfectly...the general layout of the plot, the inter-chapters' poetic style, and the finely crafted characters all set this book above others. The writing is just so tightly knit that I was in awe at how the book was put together. It's just perfect and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is an important book, I think, in the history of the American novel. It tackles firsthand the transience of American life, and the changing roles of labor, government and faith in the twentieth century. By all means, read this book.However, I don't think this is really as great a novel as its reputation alleges it to be. I had read someplace that Steinbeck wrote this in 100 days, and I believe that might be true. The basic outline of a great novel is here-- the characters mesh together well, and the conflicts are clearly outlined. But it reads like a strong first draft. The structure of the novel is too simple and brief to justify its weighty conclusions. The characters never grow beyond types, which takes a lot of the political punch out of the book. Tom, in particular, never really develops enough as a character to make his eventual departure the powerful moment it should be.It's still a good book. But compared to Steinbeck's other novels, the characterization and plot structure just seem a bit flat. In the end, it's sort of a weepy prayer for communism amid some graphic yet empty scenes of American squalor.Historically, this novel is important. But for those who love the form, its impact might seem a bit hollow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Whenever I revisit a classic I'm struck by how much more I get out of it now than I did when I was 24 or 19 or, God forbid, 15. Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives. The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear.My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago. Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point. What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes. When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles.Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath. Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class that could benefit them in cultivating this constituency. A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The mid-west had suffered severe drought. &quot;Dusters&quot; swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit. Circe 250,000 migrants, &quot;refugees from the dust&quot;, pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The flowing in of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms there. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled &quot;to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food&quot;.This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their belongings, the Joads set forth on a journey 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short &quot;relief&quot; chapters on aspects of their route 66 experience, the tricks of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite only a couple examples; other chapters function as social on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road,the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. Steinbeck's powerful voice shows the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come. It is a voice that packs alot to say!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"There is no denying John Steinbeck's brilliance. I feel that his best work is &quot;East of Eden&quot;, but &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a monumental work, probably the one that captures his political sensibilities and the times he wrote about better than any. &quot;Grapes&quot; has character development, pathos, irony and social commentary, all biting, poignant and loving at the same time. Its political message is Socialist. The problem with this is that it offers great misery, packaged in the plight of the Joad family and Okies headed to California during the Dust Bowl '30s, but it does not offer solutions. Business owners, capitalists, policemen and authority figures are fairly evenly displayed as unfeeling, selfish, sometimes racist, and mean.What Steinbeck chose not to do was to see the 1930s from their standpoint. The message would seem to indicate that he advocated that the government just handle all the Okies' problems, but this creates some problems. First, the FDR Administration did more in this regard than any previous government, or any since, possibly. With this in mind, then the question devolves into the conclusion that government intervention is not the answer.The question I kept asking was, Why do roadside business owners or cops or others barely struggling during terrible times owe something to these Okies? From the Christian standpoint, they do. But the Okies had no job skills. They offered little. They were not marketable. They were willing to work, but they could not do anything other than manual labor.It is easy to criticize them for coming to California where there were more people than jobs, but they apparently were coerced into it by misleading flyers advertising fruit waiting to be picked and jobs aplenty.In the light of historical retrospect, the unsaid message of this book at its time was that the people described would be &quot;saved&quot; if they lived in Communism. Those who flirted with Communism in America in the 1930s can be excused, considering the times. But Steinbeck was an educated man, and by the time he finished this book, the basic facts about Stalin's Russia were known. Russia was in shambles, millions had already been murdered, starved and imprisoned. It was hell on Earth. Steinbeck had to know, if not every gory detail, enough to establish the fact that Communism was utterly evil.This left him, it seems, between a rock and a hard place, which was the big problem for all the Communists and fellow travelers in the West. The Utopian ideal does not adhere to reality. In the end, &quot;Grapes&quot; describes misery and plays to guilt, a powerful strategy.What history tells us is that the &quot;answer&quot; to the Okies' predicament, while not perfect, while not timely, was in the end the fact that they lived in America, which to paraphrase Chuirchill is &quot;the worst country known to man with the exception of all other countries known to man.&quot;To live in America offered more hope and more chance of success to these people than all other Earthly possibility. Steinbeck does not portray that. He does not necessarily deserve to be excoriated for it; it would require perhaps more vision than he had in light of his publication and probable editorial time constraints. However, travel the California landscape today and one will find the children and grandchildren of these Okies, and they will mainly tell you stories of struggle that ended in various forms of happiness and success for the ancestors of the Okies.Despite any political differences, Steinbeck is a writer of such talent and inner greatness that it cannot be denied.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Sure, this novel is beautifully written, but the propaganda aspect of the work gets in the way pretty quickly. Every aspect of capitalism is condemned as evil by Steinbeck and the characters in the book are depicted as one of three types of people: A) The Victims, B) The Helpless Tools, C) The Evil Capitalists.The victims, such as the Joads, are portrayed as helpless one-trick ponies who, despite having some wonderful skills that could have made them some money, can't seem to adjust to the changing times and are either too dumb or too nostalgic to strike out on their own. They spend the entire novel drifting toward some sort of idiotic fantasy world that they're warned off of time and time again. Do they listen to the warnings? No. They continue stubbornly, in a way that isn't really explained by Steinbeck. Why exactly is it that the Joads don't believe the various characters telling them not to continue on to California? Who knows? Apparently, Steinbeck doesn't because he offers no explanation for -- or even acknowledgement of -- this.The Helpless Tools are those who serve the monsters, the corporations, which have grown uncontrollable by the men who created them. The tools do the bidding of the monstrous companies and, though they empathize with the Victims, they're helpless to resist the will of the companies -- the companies who eat profits and die without them.Then we encounter the Evil Capitalists. These are the evil men who actually dare to make a living for themselves by making a profit. Oh, stop! What are you!? The Devil!!?!? Good, God, man. Steinbeck would have fit right in at any of the recent 'Occupy' rallies anywhere in the world. Were he alive today, I'm sure he'd be giving some magnificent speech at the Democratic National Convention -- and hosted by Hugo Chavez soon after.Despite all of this though -- if you're a writer, this book is mandatory reading. There is so much masterful technique to learn from this book that you're only doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. You're literally limiting your potential because if you have the education and experience to appreciate it, this book is a gold mine of advanced technique.Pinch your nose at the politics and read this if you're a writer -- or else I'm giving you an automatic 'C'! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The story of a family who had to leave their home during the dust bowl years.

The Joad family, uprooted from their 40-acre Oklahoma farm during the late 1930s by economic hard times, brought on by drought and dust storms and exacerbated by corporate greed and efficiencies of big agriculture, journey westward to California because they \\"got to\\" in order to stay alive, make a decent living, and retain a tenuous sliver of human dignity.Through strife, exhaustion and personal tragedy, the Joads maintain their faith that the sun will shine tomorrow, no matter how heavily the rain falls today. In sharp contrast to Grampa's dream to \\"get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush . . . [and] squash \`em on my face an' let \`em run offen my chin,\\" and the family's hope that \\"it'll be all different out there--plenty work, an' ever'thing nice an' green, an' little white houses an' oranges growin' aroun',\\" California for the newcomer Joads is synonymous with difficulty finding work, menial wages when work is available, harsh living conditions, blatant animosity towards \\"Okies\\" from the local residents, constant money shortages, and always being hungry. By story's end, we are left wondering how the Joads are any better off after being flooded out of their railcar encampment next to a cotton field in central California, but we somehow find solace and comfort in the poignancy of Rosasharn's bighearted willingness to give from her own breast the precious life she has to share.According to Steinbeck (and I think he is right on this point), the most generous people are those who have the least material wealth and fewest possessions. \\"For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \`I,' and cuts you off forever from the \`we.'\\" Further, in the words of (reformed) ex-preacher Casy (whose voice is probably Steinbeck's), \\"a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big one.\\" If only each of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.From a stylistic point of view, I found the many interludes juxtaposed between the primary chapters of the book more distracting than informative, particularly the ones written in stream-of-consciousness form. If the reason for including these \\"extraneous\\" interludes is to provide background information to complement the \\"Joad\\" chapters, then, in my opinion, Steinbeck should have adhered to a more documentary form in these sections, doing the research to develop the interludes into a more substantive and factual picture of the historical setting, condition of American society during the Great Depression years, and ironies of California as a land of boundless opportunity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"California, 1939: \\"The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price . . . oranges dumped . . . The people come for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges . . .\\"\\"There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates--died of malnutrition--because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.\\"This is a brilliant and penetrating engagement of America's and California's cultural history, that will remain an important work as long as humans are willing to examine what it is to be human.Seventy years later, it is too easy for comfortable Americans to believe that Steinbeck's earthy and troubled scenes of people struggling to live are now removed from our present concerns. Displaced migrants for whom dignity or health is beyond reach, desperate to find enough work to feed their familial children, aged, sick and dying, being beaten and shot and driven from impoverished tent camps--we are _not_ seventy years removed. Present realities are actually worse. Trickle-down economics' trickles stay closer to the wealthy than ever before. 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. 1.1 billion live on less than $1/day. These are 2001's numbers, and it's not gotten better. The economic causes are global, and the people spraying kerosene on the systemic waste of food (borrowing from Steinbeck's account above), are America's largest agricultural conglomerations subsidized by comfortably disinterested Americans. US farm subsidies, instituted during the depression years to support America's family farms, are now flowing into megacorporations, providing permission, power, and position to adjust food prices to their advantage. The lion's share of today's agricultural subsidies is really taxpayer funded \`corporate welfare.' Don't expect your legislative representative to admit to this anytime soon, let alone try to grapple with it. And the reach is global. The would-be small family farmer in sub-Saharan Africa has no hope of competing with giant US food producers, brokers, and market fixers. Without any real hope for a domestic agricultural sector (excepting crops that can profitably be shipped to wealthier nations), these cultures have no light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel has collapsed.No, expect instead that your representative is busy making sure you can buy more assault weapons, and more armor piercing ammunition too. Perhaps chumming with lobbyists for the afore mentioned market-fixers, or piously blustering about someone else's sexuality. Expect also for this representative to tell us what a benevolent people we noble Americans are. He may even interject some lovely sounding numbers in this regard. Question these numbers honestly. What percentage of a given program is for the salaries of American \`consultants'? What percentage of our GNP is this generosity as compared to the percent GNP contributions of the other nations of the wealthy west? Are wealthy and/or complacent Americans the people \`spraying kerosene' on the food that could feed the hungry? This is a very expansive issue, and perhaps I digress just a bit.Steinbeck was a wonderful writer, subversive in the eyes of the cultural status quo. We need another Steinbeck, of sorts. We could use many of them. This same basic storyline is painfully intimate in the lives of hundreds of millions today, but the scale is much larger and the distance and differentiation between the malnourished migrant and the wealthy lords of lands and foods has grown dramatically.\\"Tom stepped clear of the ditch and wiped the sweat out of his eyes. \\"You hear what that paper said \`bout agitators up north a Bakersfiel'?\\"\\"Sure,\\" said Wilkie. \\"They do that all a time.\\"\\"Well, I was there.

Its a revealing story that depicts true poverty and the struggle for survival. Steinback does an extraordinary job on giving us a glimpse of what life would be like if jobs and food was limited. It was shocking to see what people were willing to accept for a hard day's work. Families were broken up , children were starved and put to work, it was really demoralizing. This book was basically the struggles of a family in the 1930's to make it to the West where &quot;work was plentiful&quot; , but later discover that things are not how they pictured them. It was a great book but it was a little lengthy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Great Depression and the 'Dust Bowl', two of the worst disasters to strike our nation in the last hundred years. The author, John Steinbeck, takes a chance at creating a story to properly convey the story of millions of migrant farmers kicked off their land during this period in the 1930s. He succeeded through the Joad family. Trying to create a new and better life, the Joads leave their Oklahoma home and travel to the land of promise, California. The travel to and throughout the state provides the perfect setting for a story of the terrible injustices and obstacles that migrant workers of the time faced. The main problem that many will have with the novel is the pacing of the story for the first 20 or so chapters. Not without its bright spots, the first chapters although good, can be terribly slow. It took much willpower to keep reading this classic. Another contributing factor is Steinbeck's intermittent chapters, through which he giving a sort of social commentary. The chapters seem to take away from the story by destroying the pacing of the novel. Although these two characteristics didn't suit me, I am glad that I kept reading. The book is a surefire classic. While in some places overly symbolic, the novel tells such a great story, and is told in such a fashion, that you can't help but sit and think after reading the last words. I am writting this review directly after that period of thinking. I strongly recommend this book to anyone willing to think. And to dig deeply into their minds and souls to review what images and feelings that the book has imposed on them. I am a freshman in high school and the book is required reading for my class. The sad thing is that this wonderful story is lost on many of my classmates.

I am not a high school student who hated the interculary chapters (some of which were the best ones in the book...especially the one about fermenting anger). My biggest problem with this book is that Steinbeck simply takes it too seriously. The symbolism (through characters and otherwise) and life metaphors are so blatantly obvious that it leaves nothing to the imagination. Symbolism and cultural criticism works better when it's subtle and veiled behind, oh, I don't know, a plot. Yes, GoW did have a plot, just not an interesting one. It was a midly engaging story with occasional interesting points, but there were no plot twists. However, much more sadder than Steinbeck's storytelling is the reviewer who said &quot;I'll stick to Michael Chrichton.&quot; That is really, really sad. I hope they keep shoving this book down high school kids' throats if it keeps them from reading spoon-fed media hyped pulp fiction.

The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it.

Lured to California by handbills promising plenty of work at good wages, they set out on a perilous journey along that perennial American roadway Route 66. Along the way they suffer mechanical trouble, family illness and outright hostility from people who despise them and call them \\"Oakies\\" (roughly the same as \\"white trash\\" or a Caucasian variant of the \\"n word.\\")Upon arriving in the Golden State they are soon disillusioned by what they encounter. They are forced by corrupt police officers and hateful locals to move from one place to the next, sometimes not even allowed to get one night's sleep before being driven out. At the same time they are economically exploited by the same people who persecute them. They serve as cheap, disposable labor during harvest season. There is one particularly poignant scene where a farmer yells \\"get out of here, you filthy Oakies. You're not wanted! And don't come back until the cotton needs picking!\\"The strength and resilience with which the Joads endure the almost endless horror and travail they face speaks to their strength and basic decency, as opposed to the \\"respectable\\" people, who are driven by hatred, prejudice and greed. Steinbeck achieves a masterful level of social commentary in this powerful book. Highly recommended.FURTHER COMMENTS WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERSOn a more abstract level, The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, affirmative answer to the question posed by Cain to God: \\"Am I my brother's keeper?\\"Steinbeck believes that all of us are, and he drives this point home with force.His words drip with contempt as he writes about the morally degenerate condition of the wealthy land owners. They dehumanize their workers, labeling them \\"Oakies,\\" by which they mean stupid, filthy, nearly worthless animals. They fail to see the common humanity they share with these people, and through their blindness they lay up grapes of wrath in the souls of the oppressed. In so doing they ensure that this righteous anger will one day drive the Oakies to revolt against them, raining every drop of the wine of vengenace down upon their heads.This theme is contrasted with another, more subtle one that pulses through the book: that all of humanity is one giant soul, as a character in the book phrases it, and the key to achieving justice is to act this principle out. Hence, towards the end of the book, the Joad's concern for their own family grows to envelop the other migrant farm workers. They see that they are all one, and the only way to achieve social justice is to take that truth and act on it by caring for each other's needs and standing united against their oppressors.The book ends on an inconclusive note. Steinbeck never tells us what ultimately happens to these people, whom the reader has come to care about deeply by the novel's climax. In the last scene Rose of Sharon, a migrant teenage girl who recently lost her baby, breast feeds a man who is starving to death. There is no titillation in this scene, quite the opposite. When read within the book's context it illustrates beautifully that Rose has learned the great lesson. She knows that all of humanity is one, and must act as one, caring for each person as if they were her own flesh and blood.This ending provides the weary reader with a hopeful moment to end with, after traveling with these people through nearly 500 pages of despair. Dismal, powerful, oddly inspiring and ultimately unforgettable, The Grapes of Wrath is a literary journey that none should miss."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I can't say enough about this book or the author, John Steinbeck. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a heart-wrenching story about a family and its struggles and perseverence through the Depression.

The Grapes of Wrath masterfully tells a compeling story of the Joad family during the Depression and Dust Bowl era. However, it is not until one digests this story that the metaphors, and contaversial themes surely erupt in the conscientious reader. The final scene in this book shows that even when driven to the most dire circumstances, good will still exists. While many see the work as an historic piece about the Depression era, I believe Steinbeck's themes in the Grapes of Wrath could have been played out in any era about social turmoil and economic ruin. But I am glad he chose the Depression era, and I am sure other readers will be too. Inasmuch as some people will see this book as a snapshot of the Depression, I think many have found it to be a study in the human condition that is timeless.

This was Steinbecks strong suit. Say what you will about his leftist, \\"Socialist\\", leanings, I believe Poore said it best; \\"Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel Prize the Nobel judges needed him.\\" Poore concluded: \\"His place in [U.S.] literature is secure.

I assumed, prematurely, that a 'classic' would be a dull read; however, Steinbeck's descriptive and emotionally charged dialogue is compelling and engaging. A must!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath truly is the Great American Novel. From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit. Steinbeck captures the spirit of the times perfectly through his compelling characters. This is as good as it gets.I listened to the unabridged audio edition, and it is fabulous. The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic. His dialogue is perfect.If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax. But that's probably necessary to the overall plot. Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was required reading in HS which, of course, I didn't do :025 years later I decided to read many of the literary classics that I faked my way through. 'Grapes of Wrath' took me about 100 pages to get locked into. Steinbeck's writing style was difficult for me to digest at first. Once I got hooked, I went back a re-read the first 100 pages. At 500 pages it took me a couple of weeks to get through. But at every sequential reading session I found myself covering more and more pages until I read the final 100 pages in one sitting.Great story based upon anecdotal evidence that probably played out in many variations, thousands of times for thousands of 'Oakie' families after the great depression and dust bowl periods."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, is a brilliantly crafted work that appeals to readers of every class and background. It brings to life the battles of injustice and the strength of a family bond that all Americans, young and old, can identify with. Steinbeck masterfully illustrates the movement and transformation of an entire nation and the struggle of the powerful verses the powerless that accompanies this changing America.John Steinbeck's background and the events that he experienced while writing this novel helped to add realism and believability to his work of fiction. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath in the late 1930s during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Drought and the Great Depression left workers without jobs, money, or food. Many people could not pay back their loans or mortgages so the banks took their houses and land, forcing them to migrate to a place where they hoped to start over. Since Steinbeck lived in California during this time of despair, he witnessed what happened to the people who migrated to his home state. He even lived with a family in Oklahoma and traveled to California with them so that his story could be as realistic as possible.The Grapes of Wrath plots the struggles of the Joads, an Oklahoma Dust Bowl family who is forced off their land and journey's to the \\"Promise Land\\" of California. Steinbeck tells the tales of their family and the millions that traveled beside them, pointing out the many injustices they all faced. People were thrown out into the elements when the banks came in like \\"snub-nosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through fences, through dooryards\\" (35). The protagonist of the novel is Tom Joad, the Joad's oldest son, who has just been released from prison. He returns home to find his family's farm abandoned and destroyed. Tom finds his family packing all of their belongings into a broken down pick-up truck at his Uncle John's house. They have decided to take the risk and make the long journey West to find work. This journey is filled with tragedy and struggles as the strong bond of the family begins to slowly break apart. Injustice and discrimination linger in each town, waiting for the Joads to arrive. They are viciously called \\"Okies\\" (279) and are forced to stay in dirty camps called \\"Hoovervilles\\" (234). They struggle to find work, prevent starvation, and fight for their pride. Tom tries to defend his family and people but goes too far and is forced to go into hiding. He eventually leaves his family to try to organize the migrant workers to fight while his pregnant sister Rose of Sharon uses her gift to help her fellow man. The story leaves the reader with a sense of hope that the migrant families will soon break free from their \\"slavery\\" and discrimination.Throughout his novel, Steinbeck effectively uses shifts in point of view to completely develop his ideas. He uses a narrator that is omniscient and all-knowing for a majority of his book. This gives the reader insight on the thoughts of all the characters as well as society. At some points during the novel, the narrator describes broad, social events that an entire group of people are experiencing. Also, the narrator can take on the voice of a type of individual that is a part of this group of people (like a migrant farmer or a California landowner). Steinbeck shows the readers both perspectives to try to capture the time as accurately as possible. Finally, many times the narrator is also objective and unnamed, like a detached observer who does not assume a character's perspective. It seems as though the narrator is there watching while the Joad family's lives unfold through conversations.Along with changing the perspectives throughout his novel, Steinbeck also utilizes many different and important literary devices. He effectively employs diction, tone, and structure to develop his plot and themes. Steinbeck's unique and descriptive diction develop his own informal style of writing. He uses a mix of both middle and low diction to illustrate the lives of the farmers. He is very descriptive and applies middle diction to paint a picture of the setting and important events of the time. \\"To the red country and the part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth\\" (1). Steinbeck also uses low diction and dialect when the characters have conversations to illustrate their backgrounds and to make his novel more realistic. He utilizes plain, easy to understand language so that the common man, woman, or child can read and understand his novel. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath to illustrate the plight of the lower class farmers of the Great Depression and intended that people of all economic and social backgrounds could discover his themes.Steinbeck also employs tone and structure to highlight his themes. He gives his novel a sympathetic tone toward the migrant families and at times it is apparent that he is outraged by the injustices that they face. But he knows that those injustices empower the workers and they will soon unite together. \\"Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. For here \`I lost my land' is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate-\`We lost our land'\\" (151). Also, Steinbeck uniquely structures his novel to show the readers different perspectives and to foreshadow the future tragedies and hardships that the Joads will face. He precedes major events with short chapters that describe the state of America and that foreshadow the future. Steinbeck's use of diction, tone, and structure does an excellent job of creating an interesting plot and serving as a way to introduce his many themes.Finally, Steinbeck uses his choices in characters, plot, and setting to highlight his intended themes. He portrays a poor and struggling family from Oklahoma as the main characters of his story so that he can illustrate his theme of the powerful against the powerless. The Joads are left with nothing after the bank takes their land and are forced to leave the dry, dust-filled Great Plains where \\"it was black night, for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards\\" (3). Here the land is brown and dead, it has no power and no promise for a better future. So they travel to the California \\"Promise Land\\" which is full of \\"Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waves in a shallow sea. The full green hills are round and soft\\" (346). California is green and alive, growing with opportunity and power, waiting to create brighter futures. The Joads are the stereotypical \\"Okies\\" that are forced to carry all of their belongings in a broken down truck and face the discrimination of people who do not understand their desperate situation. They do not have work, money, or food and as a result are left powerless. Ultimately, Steinbeck shows how a family's bond and the strength of women as the holding force of a family can overcome all injustice and unite people together.In the end, Steinbeck has created a brilliant novel that effectively utilizes many literary devices to illustrate the battle between those that have and those that do not. The migration of a country was filled with injustice and it brought out the best and the worst of America. Steinbeck could use his novel to unite a country, and to show people what The Grapes of Wrath can accomplish. \\"The break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath\\" (435). Ultimately, the powerless migrant workers used their \\"wrath\\" to make \\"grapes\\" and good out of a terrible situation. Families came together and demonstrated how unity can powerfully defeat hardship and injustice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath stands as the greatest piece of literature from the Depression era. No other work is as effective in portraying life at that time. The Joad family's struggle and journey are remarkably vivid to the reader, as Steinbeck makes it impossible not to sympathize with them. Steinbeck's writing style, as usual, makes for a great read, as he goes back and forth between the Joads and a kind of sweeping overview of the attitudes and effects of the Depression overall. But it is the Joads story that is really the meat of this incredible tale. I fully reccommend it to anyone; few works have had such a great influence and mark on American literature."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},E={key:1};function q(s,e,r,u,n,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[n.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const j=c(H,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-36596774"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/47.md","filePath":"glossary/47.md"}'),O={name:"glossary/47.md"},J=Object.assign(O,{setup(s){return(e,r)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{D as __pageData,J as default};
