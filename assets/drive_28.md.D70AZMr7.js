I thought it was another field guide that specialized in turtle. It turns out that the good things said about it are true. This is a classic among turtle guides as it cover anatomy and physiology of turtles and provides extra incite on species. The book was revised in the 1995 mainly to update the scientific names and the maps may have been updated. This book was not revised by Archie Carr since he had passed away. However the original content of the book has not changed. Mr. Carr makes this guide interesting read which is a great feat when you do nature, field or animal guides. The book is hard to find since it has not been reprinted since 1995.

Darling raises good points that Custer's continuous fractionalizing of his force; leaving the pack train, sending Benteen to a left scout at the divide, sending Reno forward at Lone Teepee, Custer's turn to the north all led to his demise in the face of a concentrated enemy. The main premise is that Custer did a wonderful job of proceeding cautiously and professionally in his search for the Sioux until he got within 15 miles. The most damaging charge against Custer is that Darling states that Custer never fully believed his scouts that a large village actually existed on the LBH. The other charge is that Custer ordered Reno to attack only the small village refugees at Lone Teepee (Reno Creek) which was a small collection of 70 - 90 indians with families. And the most serious charge, Custer turned north perhaps only guessing that Reno would go north to chase the Lone Teepee village escapees.Issues that could be argued against these theories, Custer's Chief of Scouts saw the smoke from the large village at the Crow's nest and the Crow scouts said they could see a large pony herd on the LBH. In effect, it would be hard to argue that Custer totally disregarded the village being on the LBH and that his turn to the right along the bluffs was a calculated guess. Benteen was told to scout on the left but not go indefinitely in that direction to infinity as Benteen later charged. Darling fails to mention that Custer sent Benteen two messengers to keep abreast of Benteen's progress and he was expected to rejoin the main column after his scout. Reno's alledged order to only attack just the Lone Teepee village seems hard to swallow since Custer said he would support Reno with the whole outfit which would be a greater need than chasing 70 - 90 Indians. Besides Scout Gerard, riding with Reno, came back to Custer's adjutant Cook to report the LBH village size and that the Sioux and Cheyene stopped running and were fighting. Custer certianly knew this after Cook reported. Also, Darling fails to mention that Boston Custer, the civilian younger brother, passed Benteen watering his horses on his liesurely pursuit of Custer's trail and that Boston reported and died with Custer . Thinking that Benteen would soon catch up with his battalion, most likely impactd Custer's decisions perhaps causing a delay. Finally, Custer had four Crow Scouts and Mitch Boyer with him that knew the territory and most of which were at the Crows Nest. They knew the terrian and probably offered alternatives to attack the Sioux and Cheyenne using the geography of the land. In Darlings great book \\"A Terrible and Sad Blunder\\" Darling offers that Reno strayed from his ordered reconnaissance to determine the direction of the Sioux but also because the scout Mitch Boyer offered an alternative trail to follow. Why isn't it reasonable to presume that Boyer did the same for Custer? If Boyer did the same for Custer providing an alternative attack approach and Reno held and Benteen rejoined the command perhaps the outcome would have been different, perhaps not a Custer victory but survival of much more of his command. Darling invokes a good argument but leaves out some critical points but it is a good read and at times a relatively reasonable argument. Perhaps if Custer had the advantage of hindsight, he wouldn't have made the decisions that he had but in the midst of fast moving action he did so with the information and history that he had at present."},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"This is an author who should be getting more attention. Her writing is lovely and her story equally so. From the first sentence you know you are in the hands of someone who can write and has a story to tell. It is a rare combination of talents.

I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"This book is a beautifully written account of a family and the Japanese spirit that inhabits one of the children.

Pywell draws such a beautiful, exacting portrait of the family dynamic - complete with a fascinating historical component and the very real world of schizophrenia. I have already purchased her other two books available on Amazon & will search for more."},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"This book is a fascinating novel that follows three siblings relationship through adulthood coping in a fairly positive way with a dysfunctional family life . The story is primarily seen through the middle child's eyes--a girl--a la Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird. But the story is filled with magical realism, and a secondary story about the bombing of Hiroshima on the individuals and its far reaching effect on the generation of the 1950's. There is more of a dark perspective about family, sibling relationships, and growing up in the guilty consciousness of the US culture of the 1950's than Lee's book has about its cultural conflict of racism. It is a compelling book, realistic, and doesn't dwell on the family environment looking for blame or restitution, but on the children making it through into adulthood as they survive all the adult responsibilities they shared as kids."},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"Sharon Pywell's beautifully crafted debut novel, \\"What Happened To Henry,\\" chronicles the lives of the three extraordinary Cooper siblings from early childhood through adulthood in 1960's post WWII USA. The book's recurrent theme is the powerful, haunting memory of the devastation at Hiroshima, in the aftermath of the atomic-bomb drop of 1945 that brought immediate or horrifically lingering death to more than 140,000 people. The A-bomb, which the Japanese called \\"pika-don,\\" did not simply kill, maim and injure masses of people and destroy buildings. It obliterated all the living and the community of the living. It devastated society and wrecked havoc on the environment. This year, 2005, is the 60th anniversary of Hiroshima's and Nagasaki's annihilation. The subject is introduced into the narrative in a subtle manner, and gives one pause to reflect on the impact the atomic bomb had, not only on Japanese and US children, but on children everywhere, who grew up in the days of the Cold War, with threats of nuclear missile attacks as a backdrop to their lives.The Coopers are a middle class family of devout Catholics who live in a the suburban community of Eleusis, NY. It is 1960. Lauren, the middle child, is having a problem getting through First Communion. She is the only nine year-old in the class. A \\"First Communion failure,\\" this is the third time she repeats the curriculum but will hopefully receive the sacrament soon, along with her seven year-old classmates. She had been foiled on her initial attempt by multiple streptococcus infections. Her fate was sealed on her second shot by a bowl of salted peanuts she found lying on the kitchen table. Lauren had a momentary lapse of memory about fasting before receiving the host. Her older brother Henry witnessed her downfall, so she couldn't lie. Thus, she continues to study catechisms with the stern, feisty, ever practical Sister Leonarda, hoping to succeed and get it over with. Lauren really struggles with the logic and veracity behind transubstantiation, martyrdom and heaven, especially when the sister makes pronouncements like, \\"Those who believe that they can evade judgment are generally struck down by trucks or disease before they can receive the sacrament of Extreme Unction.\\" Lauren has good reason to question these beliefs, as the reader will discover.Winston, the youngest Cooper is seven and a little hellion...or perhaps \\"tyrant\\" would be a more apropos description. When his wishes, which become his commands, are not fulfilled, or when his feelings are hurt, he dismantles everything in sight, and is quite effective in his destruction skills, being mechanically and electrically inclined. Winston compulsively takes the protective coverings off wall sockets and rewires everything. He is always absconding with his father's tools, like the hacksaw he smuggled into his bedroom to saw his bed's headboard in half. Annie Cooper, the children's mother, is distraught by her son's behavior and can never quite understand what possesses him. Warren Cooper, the family's father, an engineer working in the Research and Development department of a large defense corporation, admonishes his son for using a hacksaw to cut wood. He is upset that his son picked the wrong tool for the job. Lauren bitterly complains to older brother, Henry, that Winston gets away with murder.Twelve year-old Henry is the family's pillar of strength and stability. Lauren adores him and depends on him emotionally for his wisdom, strength of character and level-headedness. She has a recurring nightmare in which she watches a man in a cornfield shoot Henry. The dream always ends with Lauren holding his body in her arms, thinking, \\"...I don't know the way.\\" Even the inscrutable Winston responds to his big brother. Other than being kind, insightful and creative, Henry is a normal pre-adolescent boy, who is into building model fighter airplanes from WWII. His collection hangs in his room in simulated fight patterns. He is a bit obsessed, however, with looking at the photographs in a library book entitled, \\"Disaster, Disaster, Disaster,\\" which graphically documents the horrors of the Hiroshima bomb! The picture he is most fascinated by is of a Japanese man with his arms outstretched, running toward a terribly burned woman - toward the blazing inferno caused by the bomb, not away from it.In 1958, when the Cooper kids were ten, seven and five respectively, a terrible tragedy hit the family hard. By December, 1962, everyone had seemingly recovered from the emotional aftermath of the event which left them bereft. The Cooper method of getting their lives back on track is invariably the same - never discuss the problem, and repress, repress, repress. The three sibling, who were so looking forward to Christmas, have their holiday marred when Henry receives a powerful electric shock from an overheated record turntable and is rushed to the hospital. He sleeps for three days and awakens, seemingly none the worse for wear. Lauren learns differently, however, shortly after he returns home.Henry is experiencing a bizarre phenomenon - he has access to the thoughts of Suriya Asagao, a survivor of the Hiroshima bombing. Asagao died of leukemia several months afterwards, in 1946. Henry feels as if he is inside the man's head. Asagao, in fact, is not a man, but a spirit who wanders in the Void, in the Kingdom of the Dead. He suffers from the unbearable pain of loss. He searches continually for his beloved wife, Ishiru, the women he runs toward in the disaster book photograph. Asagao is unable to release himself from limbo until he lets go of Ishiru's memory. Meanwhile, Henry begins to speak Japanese, his syntax takes on foreign inflections, he acquires new knowledge about Japanese culture and Buddhism without studying these subjects, and is able to describe, in great detail, life in prewar Hiroshima.The novel poignantly portrays the siblings banding together to protect Henry and Asagao, (who becomes like an invisible adopted brother to them), from being discovered. They know from prior experience that when they answer psychiatrists' questions truthfully, Henry is taken away to spend time in an institution and medicated until he can no longer think clearly. The reader follows the three Coopers through college, marriage and children in this extraordinary and most unusual tale.Ms. Pywell's prose is extremely lyrical. This is truly a beautifully written novel. The author ably pulls off Henry and Asagao communing in the spirit world to such an extent that their relationship becomes more realistic than any diagnosis of pathological illness. The characters of the three siblings are exceptionally well drawn, and the emotional ties that bind them together are complex and moving. \\"Whatever Happened To Henry\\" is an absolutely compelling, life affirming book about family ties, love, faith, the enduring quality of history - and about a repertory dance company and beautiful Japanese religious ceremonies, both Buddhist and Shinto. There is also lots of humor here and I found myself laughing out loud. I also cried through a few pages.Fellow avid readers, this should be at the top of your TBR list. A definite must read. You will thank me for the recommendation! ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"This is a story about fragmented people in fragmented relationships, in a fragmented world. A fanciful tale of the interplay between the the spirits of the living and the dead or a brilliant case study of group delusion?"},{"Title":"What Happened to Henry","review":"Sharon Pywell has accomplished the impossible; she has written a book about transcendence that is poignant and often hilarious, open to all wounds yet filled with hope. She erects finite boundaries in order to trample them: images from Japan seep into a New York household, past oozes into present, death into life, insanity into revelation, infidelity into pure devotion. She rejects easy answers in favor of paradox, synthesis and higher truth.Pywell's main character often feels the pull of opposite impulses, such as her bitter rivalry with one brother, her blind love for the other. Pywell has done a masterful job at describing the attraction of metaphysical questions, combined with doubt about the answers. I am so grateful for Pywell's humorous portrayal of young Lauren Cooper puzzling over the edicts of her catechism teacher, Sister Leonarda.Pywell's prose is fresh and vivid as the latest gossip, so steeped in ambiguous detail that it could be poetry, albeit very fun and readable poetry. Her characters are so true and so vulnerable that you wish you could hug them; they tug at your feelings like old songs. Women hide behind crusty attitudes, plays for attention and acts of service; men find safety behind slide rules, testosterone and care-giving, and yet all seek redemption through love.Indeed, this is one of the most searching explorations of the nature and power of love that I have ever read. _What happened to Henry?_ is a must-read for anyone who suspects that love and salvation are related, as well as for anyone who longs for a new voice on the literary scene."},{"Title":"All Color Book of Henry VIII","review":"This is a beautiful over-sized book, chiefly portraits of Henry and his wives.

There was a split in the Liberal Catholic movement in this country in the 1950's. The present Liberal Catholic Church International was sued by another group over ownership of the Cathedral in Los Angeles, although the underlying dispute was an attempt by the then Presiding Bishop in England to impose a Regionary Bishop over the United States without the consent of the clergy, as required in the Church's Constitution. The trial court ruled that the Liberal Catholic Church is now the body sometimes called the Liberal Catholic Church International.

His teachiings can balance your life and make you prosperous and productive in ways you've never dreamt. Practicing what you learn will automatically and effortlessly eliminate a lot of dross from your existanceRussell teaches you the actual physical workings of the universe clearly and cleanly.

It's a book to meditate on and apply to all aspects of life. One day life on Earth will be much simpler and life-affirming, and people won't have to look so hard for love and joy.

Literally, the world over, Beckett is used by more people than in other guide on the market. This fine publication also has monthly guides covering baseball, basketball, football, and hockey. Beckett does extensive research on the hobby and sends analysts all over the world to keep track on what's happening in the baseball card market. Dr. James Beckett is an expert in the field of baseball card collecting and in this book gives readers valuable tips on how to preserve, store, and grade cards as well as lists in detail some of the most popular and sought after cards ever produced. With all the cards on the market, it is almost impossible to list them all in one book, so Beckett lists the ones that show the most interest to the general public. Now if you are into collecting rarities, you'll really want this price guide since Beckett lists some of the most rarest cards ever made. Many sets and singles alike are listed along with values on most all of them. Believe it or not, but, there are some cards on the market today that are so rare, a clear value cannot be placed on them, they are literally priceless. These include the very popular ONE OF ONES. These are cards where only one of each card in a set is produced.If you are looking for a guide that has the most up-to-date information, the most listings and the most reliability, you can't beat Beckett. Please note this: If you go to Beckett or any other guide and cannot find a value for your card or cards, dont think for a moment that what you have is worthless. Like I stated earlier, with so many cards on the market today it is almost impossible to list them all, plus, some cards are produced that are so rare that NO ONE in the hobby may know about them until years later. For example, in 1990 Topps produced its regular baseball set including a Frank Thomas rookie. What no one knew was that there was also a very rare error card of Mr. Thomas produced. For years it was not even given a value, then finally the error card was listed with only a small value. Time passed and the card held that estimated value until it began a month by month rapid surge upward. As of August 2001, that same card is worth well over 500.00I recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out what certain cards are worth or who would like to learn about some of the history of the baseball card market."},{"Title":"Beckett Official Price Guide to Baseball Cards 2002, 21st Edition","review":"The beckett book was a great sorce to me because I have been collecting baseball cards sence I was 3 yr old and because I have over 7,000 cards so I think this book will be a good sorce for you to."},{"Title":"Beckett Official Price Guide to Baseball Cards 2002, 21st Edition","review":"Not a practical guide in this collecting age.

Heschel is routinely mentioned as one of the great Jewish philosophers of the 20th century and so I was excited to delve into this, one of his \\"greatest works\\". I could hardly have been more disappointed.Heschel is a mystic and as such, eschews rationalist approaches to religion. Ok, sure. I'm willing to suspend my rationalism in that area for long enough to get through the book. The damning thing, however, is that Heschel gets sloppy about where exactly this anti-rationalism applies. Even if rationalism doesn't apply to the experience of religion, even if we can't describe God or judge a religious experience in the same way we would judge a scientific breakthrough, I still expect him to provide some sort of evidence for his historical claims. He consistently refuses to do this, and the book as a whole reads as 400+ pages of unsupported claims and wild leaps.

And granted, unlikely as it is, that signs of sickness should be traced in the life of the prophets. . . it would still be absurd to reject their claim. Is it not more meaningful to maintain that a person has to be sick in order to see what those who are benighted by their robustness and complacency fail to perceive?\\"Translation \\"Even if the prophets were crazy, we still have to believe them. Perhaps its simply because we aren't crazy that we can't experience God directly.\\"p. 229 \\"What gave the prophets the certainty that they witnessed a divine event and not a figment of their own imagination? . . . A thunder out of a blue sky, a voice coming from nowhere, an effect without a visible cause, would not have been enough to identify a perception as a divine communication. . . [These] only manifest a force of nature, not God.\\"Here Heschel ignores the fact that until very recently in human history (in fact, until the rise of scientific knowledge) forces of nature were assumed to be direct actions of God. If he wasn't so intent on assuming a modern framework for the Bible, this would be readily apparent.And of course, leading questions play a large role in Heschel's rhetoric. . .p. 240 \\"Why does the Bible surpass everything created by man? Why is there no work worthy of comparison with it? Why is there no substitute for the Bible, no parallel to the history it has engendered? Why must all who seek the living God turn to its pages?\\"p. 247 \\"To deny the divine origin of the Bible is to brand the entire history of the spiritual efforts and attainments in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the outgrowth of a colossal lie, the triumph of a deception which captured the finest souls for more than two thousand years.\\"Yeah, that's right, monotheists have the best souls.p. 243 [The Bible] is the foutainhead of the finest strivings of man in the Western World. It has elicited more holiness and compassion from mankind than we are able to comprehend. Most of what is noble and just is derived from its spirit.\\"I'd say the Bible has inspired its fair share of events. The fact that Heschel can claim that those events are overwhelmingly good, however, simply showcases his blindness to history and reality.I will finish this book, not because I find anything redeeming in it, but simply so that I can say I've read Heschel. I can only hope that my future explorations of Jewish intellectual history uncover something, well, intellectual."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel's God in Search of Man is a penetrating analysis of Judaism in the modern world, attempting, and largely succeeding, in showing the human relationship to God in a modern, Jewish framework.Heschel's thinking is very subtle, so this work needs to be read slowly and carefully, with attention to its rich detail. What the reader will find is a deeply humane thinker, setting out to prove that human worth is to be found in more than mere physicality.Perhaps the greatest flaw of the work is the Heschel relies very heavily on this historicity of the revelation at Sinai. Of course, this is the keystone of Jewish existence, but he fails to explore other aspects of the epiphany at Sinai and the exodus, especially if we, as modern readers, do not literary believe in the historical truth of these events. But beyond this, God in Search of Man is a truly great work in recent Jewish thought, and should be read and read again for its gems of wisdom and understanding."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Regardless of whether you've never read a book on Judaism before, or you knocked off a blatt of gemara over breakfast, you need to read this book. Far above distinctions of movements and denominations, it provides a moving and thought-provoking phrasing of how the Jew beholds the world."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I think Heschel revealed a lot of himself in his works--more than other writers, perhaps. He seems to me to be very emotional regarding his opinions and beliefs. He came from an Eastern European Hasidic family whose ancestor was the Great Maggid of Mezerich. He was a leader in the Civil Rights movement as well as the Vietnam anti-war movement. He was on the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, (of the Jewish Conservative movement). This is rather humorous, I think, since he was obviously quite the idealistic Liberal. He had a reputation as a mystic, causing him conflict with other JTS professors. He was a very forceful personality. IMHO he was very much a literary expressionist--putting his feelings into writing. He was also quite poetic--his books include many clever and beautiful turns of phrase. However, much of what he writes comes off as if they are sermons, as if he KNOWS. I respect his views, but don't often agree with them. This book doesn't read like philosophy to me (you can read \\"Between Kant and Kabbalah\\" by Mittleman on the Jewish philosopher Breuer, for example). As a scientist, I object to anyone dismissing the contributions of science in virtually any arena. Certainly psychology is a player in anything involving humans. As a mystic, I certainly agree that the Divine is ineffable. But people translate their contact with the Divine into human terms--mostly reflecting their individual propensities, biases, views, etc. That secondary process is psychological/scientific. Indeed, such communications have been compared to radio and television with a transmitter and receivers. Furthermore, research into ESP (Dr. Rhine etc.) shows considerable applicability in understanding the processes involved in communicating with higher powers (e.g. God). In addition, Heschel insists that the Bible be understood in terms of Biblical people. Certainly, such an approach can provide an historical or hagiographical context for the causes that produced beliefs and documents (e.g. The Torah). But, it is essentially irrelevant to today's individuals attempting to apply such beliefs and documents into their lives. It is obvious that praying, studying Torah, putting on Tefillin, etc. excites and completes Heschel, but that doesn't mean they do for everyone--and certainly not identically. He makes the common human mistake of assuming everyone is like him (or should be). I humbly disagree. Nevertheless, he did provide a differing point of view to be considered as well as a couple of good quotes for my collection.:p. 317: When superimposed as a yoke, as a dogma, as a fear, religion tends to violate rather than to nurture the spirit of man. Religion must be an altar upon which the fire of the soul may be kindled by holiness.p. 361: Every act done in agreement with the will of God is a mitzvah.Mostly, however, I have to say (though I'm sure it will upset some people) that I found this particular book very boring. I liked \\"Moral Grandeur & Spiritual Audacity\\" better."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Originally written in 1955, this wonderful 400-page book provides in layman's terms the reasoning for Jewish practice and belief."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"When originally published, this book was seen as a breath of fresh air; it doesn't &quot;analyze&quot; religious thougt. Rather, it forces the reader to examine his own feelings towards G-d.Heschel, often though of as an academic with a Hasidic background, was rather a Hasidic Rebbe with university training. This work, along with his other popular books (as opposed to the scholarly ones) is written in the form of a series of Hasidic discourses at a comfort level to the reader as if he were sitting with the Rebbe at the Third Sabbath Meal and absorbing his wisdom.The central theme, the centrality of belief in and devotion to G-d, is often overlooked in contemporary Jewish literature; many veiled (and no so veiled) jibes of contemporary religious practice and life are meant to drive home the point that &quot;it's about G-d and man&quot;, not about buildings, organizations or other agendas or programs.Like the Kotzker Rebbe, Heschel's hero and spiritual father, Rabbi Dr. Heschel was able to cut through the gloss, fluff, and veneer to get to the root of man's belief in and relationship with G-d."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I first read this book in the 1960s when Dr Heschel was my teacher. I just reread it and was impressed by how beautifully he states the very abstract spiritual concepts he is discussing. His conclusions and observations are universal though couched in the language of Bible and Jewish tradition. It is heavy reading though and requires a lot of concentration. Probably best in small doses."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Such a study of wonder! This wise philosopher takes knowing God to a new level.

Heschel is a deep fellow, so this isn't a quick read. My path has me following Christ and we'd diverge there, however we share the same God of Abraham and Isaac. His writings are incredibly full of grace while drawing clear differences between Jewish thought and other systems in the world. It doesn't read like a textbook as the title might imply. It's very engaging and should cause any thoughtful person to stop and, well ... think. I'm already planning to read it again when I get to end."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel is simply wonderful if you wish to read and be amazed at the depth of Jewish thought and mysticism. His books are essential for anyone interested in Judaism, but also for Christians wishing to explore our spiritual roots. This book will not disappoint. How uplifting to know that God actively seeks us. After reading Heschel, you will have no doubt."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I love Heschel. My first foray into his works was \\"The Sabbath\\" which I immediately fell in love with. His bigger works were a little bit more daunting, but I read Man is Not Alone (which was awesome) and this one, which is known to be some kind of companion volume to Man is Not Alone. I loved them both.Heschel has a kind of writing that is very apparently typical of continental philosophers of his time. My friend, an analytic philosopher, didn't take too well to it, but his style resounded in my soul. the language is reflective, thoughtful, and pensive. It's as though you are sitting at the feet of a mystic and he is expounding his knowledge to you: not systematically, not analytically, not dogmatically, but kindly, lovingly, and experientially.I liked Man is Not Alone a little better, since it can relate to a broader audience, but there is something about Judaism that as a Christian, I am fascinated by. Knowing more about the roots of Christianity, what the people in the time of Jesus (and Jesus himself) might have believed is a big draw for me. As a Christian, I was blessed by this book and would recommend it to others. It however is not light reading, fairly thick, and definitely requires commitment. It pays off, though!"},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read. Having read SABBATH, by the same author, I had not planned upon buying this one, but it has turned out to be remarkable philosophical reading...Now, I am going over the list of other books by this author for more, just to make sure I don't miss another one as great as this one."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel is by far one of the best writers I have encountered in the area of theistic philosophy. \\"God in Search of Man\\" was easy to understand, while still delving into deeper and more philosophical issues.

It is a pleasure to share such an experience with him."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Read this book. It doesn't matter if you are Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Agnositc, whatever; this book was written for you.It should not be at all surprising that the most spiritual personalities of our age, Tillich, Ghandi, Bonhoeffer, Heschel, Barth, King, all defy the limitations of religion when expressing matters of faith; true faith somehow becomes deeply personal and at the same moment completely universal. As Heschel once said: &quot;Religion is man's answer to God's question, not God's answer to man's question.&quot;Read this book."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Were I to write to Abraham Joshua Hesschel, I would thank him for opening my heart to the Mystery that manifests Itself in the words of the Torah. I would say thank-you for addressing both my intellect and my heart. Clearly Joshua Heschel sought to reach my spirit as well as my mind. It is so wonderful to see the beauty and the pathos of God's concern for man revealed in the Hebrew Bible, to recognize God's love at the source of God's demands, to come finally to the realization that God needs you and me. At the end of this book's reading, you will say, as Joshua Heschel undoubtedly did before he wrote it, \\"Here I am.\\" Your yearning for Him is the greatest evidence of his presence."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Reverence and awe are what come to mind when I discuss Heschel, and this work in particular. He was an incredible scholar, steeped in multiple cultures (Eastern European Hasidism, Early twentieth-century Berlin, post WWII America) and he embodied so much. He was a poet as well, which is why this book, while an explication of Jewish philosophy (which can be complex at times), is also beautifully written. If you want to understand the worldview of the Hebrew Bible, God in Search of Man is a must read. If you want to understand Judaism (and to a certain extent Christianity and Islam) this book will help you. The book is so powerful because Heschel wrote it in such a way as to evoke the very emotions (and lessons) that he felt the Bible was trying to teach."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel is simply amazing. It was not until his 40's that he learned English. His precision of writting in English (this is not a translation!) is amoung the best in the world.This book is both a philosophic/logical progression as well as poetic gem.This book changed my life. My father was Jewish, my mother not. When I got to a quote from Exodus (Sh'mot) &quot;This is my God and I will glorify Him; The God of my father and I will exalt Him.&quot; I made up my mind to convert from nothing to Judaism.The idea of repair of the world, Tikkun Olam,is well and alive: &quot;It is in the employment of his (a Man's) will, not in reflection, that he meets his own self as it is; not as he should like it to be. Heschel marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and inspired many Jews to fight for the rights all all citizens in the USA.This book is thoughtful, makes one reflect and is filled with poetry from end to end. Examples. &quot;The heart is a often lonely voice in the marketplace of the living.&quot; &quot;Halacha (laws) without agada (heart / self transformation) is dead, agada without halacha is wild.&quot;As a practicing Scientist I agree with, &quot;God is not a scientifc problem, and scientific methods are not capable of solving it.&quot;Great book, super inspriring."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"&quot;God in Search of Man&quot; combines scholarship with lucidity, and reverence and compassion as Heschel elucidates the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. Section one discusses ways to God's Presence, and the legacy of wonder that religion gives; the sense of divine mystery; the illusion of nature worship; man's metaphysical loneliness; God in search of man and the concept of &quot;the chosen people&quot;. Section two of this book is concerned with the idea of Revelation, a study of what prophetic inspiration is, and the mysery and paradoxes of revelation. He discusses revelation as a process as opposed to an event, Israel's committment to God, and the principle of revelation. Section three discusses a Jew's real life response to the Jewish Religion, and looks at Judaism as a science of deeds; There is a study and rejection of the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, yet there is also a cautioning against of those rabbis that add too many hedges to the law, who mistakenly act as if all Jewish law was revealed at Mount Sinai. It discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with sprituality and love, the importance of kavanah (religious intention) when performing mitzvot , and a discussion of religious behaviorism - in which people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

One book that is exalted in my eyes despite the unassuming cover that adorns it. I am referring to God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism by Abraham Joshua Heschel. I recommend anything by this man whom Martin Luther King Jr. called a prophet but this has to be the deserted island pick. There is simply no book that has calmed me through a sleepless night so reassuringly, that has peeled more scales off my eyes and heart, and has had more to speak to the questions I'd just as soon forget than this work of religious art.Don't let the title ward you off, by the way. This book is accessible to those who know nothing of philosophy, to Jews and non-Jews alike, to everyone who still feels awe at the great mystery of existence. I recommend it with great pride"},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"The general assumption of people of the modern era has been that we must look for and search for and wait for God. The image is of Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot'. God has disappeared and is not part of our lives and we have to wait for God to return. Or if we are real searchers we would not wait, but would make the effort ourselves looking in various aspects of our experience to find the ultimate religious meaning.But Heschel's premise here is the opposite one. God is actually looking for us. God wants us. I remember speaking with one of the most loving teachers of Hasidism of modern times, the late David Herzberg of blessed memory. When I asked him about the meaning of the religious concept 'Avodat Hashem' service of God' His answer surprised me because it was different from anyone else's. He said it was God's service, God's work what God does to help and connect with us. This is very much like what Heschel is saying here. God is calling out to us ,God is Present as the Kotzker Rebbe says 'wherever we let God in'.Heschel was a great poetic and religious soul , who feels and teaches God's searching for , and connecting with us.This is a tremendously inspiring and thought- provoking work.I will only say one more word. That as a ' poetic thinker' Heschel's meaning is something suggested and sublime, something we cannot be sure we understand.What we can understand is the underlying tone of holiness throughout this work."},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"This book should be read in conjunction with Man is not alone. Both are remarkably rewarding books. I am an evangelical Christian, yet what I learned from Heschel, and yes I DID learn many things, was powerful.

If Plato's Republic was to succeed, society needed all of its citizens to be like Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. This, of course, was not the case in Plato's time - and most definitely not the case today. The wisdom of Heschel, as he so eloquently expresses in this timeless book, is needed now more than ever.Heschel did not wait for God to give him grace, because he knew that his actions were more important than words. Heschel felt compelled to act upon his commitment as a citizen and as a Jew. The result being that Heschel's spiritual life set an example for his generation and generations to come.In Heschel's own words: \\"Religion becomes sinful when it begins to advocate the segregation of God, to forget that the true sanctuary has no walls. Religion has always suffered from the tendency to become an end in itself, to seclude the holy, to become parochial, self-indulgent, self-seeking... .\\"Each page and every word in this great work gives us important wisdom. Heschel challenges us to strive for the ideal but insists that we never forget the realities and injustices that surround us.

It is unfortunate that many will not pick up this book because they first of all assume that since it is written by a Rabbi it will not have much for a Christian to absorb. WRONG!!!! In my heart of hearts, I am convinced that Heschel &quot;knew&quot; Jesus - he just didn't know Him by that name. The same thread of truth that is woven through the Old Testament, as it unveils the awesome beauty of our Creator, is the same beauty that is woven into Heschel's writings, and on into the New Testament. It is the SAME Spirit.I encourage you to get this book and ignore your fears. I had to look up almost every word when I started...yes He is very scholarly, but if you allow you mind to be broadened, the words he uses become familiar to you in time, and you too find yourself asking God to allow you to become one of those who mirrors His unending LOVE in deeds of Kindness...like Brooks that hold the sky!!!!God Bless You!I welcome correspondence with any Christian, or Jewish believers!"},{"Title":"God in search of man: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"The philosophy and theology of Judaism in this work are wonderfully user-friendly.

Anyone who has visited (or plans to visit) southern Spain will be thrilled by the account of Irving's trip, but I'll go further: you need not ever go there to enjoy this classic work of history and humor.Irving stayed at the Alhambra for three months in 1829 and jotted down notes concerning its history and legends. Early in his visit, Irving was accosted by Mateo Ximenes, a credulous and indigent \\"son of the Alhambra\\" who soon proves a worthy and endearing companion, a guide to secret chambers, and a conveyor of whimsical traditions. A couple of years later, while in London, Irving wrote \\"The Alhambra,\\" describing his idiosyncratic hosts, recounting the millennium-old history of the Moorish occupation, and transcribing fresh versions of the palace's medieval legends and myths, many of which resemble stories from the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" The first edition appeared in 1832, a second American edition was published four years later, but Irving extensively revised and enlarged the book in 1851, incorporating material unavailable or unknown to him in the 1830s. This last edition is the one most commonly available today.The result is easily Irving's most accessible book, filled with wit and anecdote. Alongside the history of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, Irving intersperses tales (both historical and mythical) of enchanted caves, imprisoned princesses, and buried treasure. His admiration for Islamic heritage is obvious throughout: \\"The Arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking, into Gothic Spain.\\" And he regularly denounces the prejudices (both medieval and contemporary) \\"so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal, which sometimes inflamed the Christian enterprises\\" and which have prevented his fellow Europeans from studying a rich and justifiably proud tradition.As Irving accurately summarizes, Moslem Spain was \\"a region of light amid Christian, yet benighted Europe; externally a warrior power fighting for existence; internally a realm devoted to literature, science, and the arts; where philosophy was cultivated with a passion . . . and where the luxuries of sense were transcended by those of thought and imagination.\\" Plus, the Islamic \\"occupiers\\" and Christian warriors certainly knew how to tell a good story. This book will delight both history and literature buffs."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The 100 greatest books ever written)","review":"I don't always like to read classics, but when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book, I decided to try it, and I am very glad that I did.

The stories and legends are also wonderful and fascinating. An antique copy of this book is one of my most treasured gifts."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The 100 greatest books ever written)","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\".

It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights.

It is an example of what I would call, non-violent murder mysteries, such as written by Agatha Christie, Essentially what we get is an early build-up, the murder, and the rest is a matter of Who Dun It and Where is the leading Suspect. The language and sentiments are sometimes what some would term dated, but I did not have any problem about that. There are a number of well-drawn characters and a super-sleuth (with a youthful protege, who makes major contributions to the investigation). While crucial to the solution, the super-sleuth plays a surprisingly small part in the book. The writing is clear, the plot line tricky but not complicated, the momentum nicely maintained. I would commend this to youthful readers who are not put off by the age of the book and to most adults who take to the \\"cozy\\" sub-genre."},{"Title":"Music for the millions (A Mentor Book)","review":"This work provides a listener's guide to a wide- range of musical masterpiences. However the entries are quite short, and in some cases misleadingly so. For instance there is in the entry on Wagner no mention of his anti- Semitism, or the controversy generated by his music. This is too the kind of reference book which has been dated by the Internet which would supply most likely fuller information on each and every entry written about here."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"This is a must-have book on screenwriting. It gives you techniques to see your story as a series of scenes that you target to build your story, use colored cards to enhance your story's conflict, techniques to get deeper into your story, techniques to find ideas within your story. This book is rich with ideas and techniques that will help you strengthen your story writing skills. Instead of spending many months writing, learn the skills in this book to write a screenplay in weeks.Best screenwriting book on the market.One reviewer above states that because Hal Ackerman hasn't sold a lot of scripts to Hollywood, he can't possibly teach you how to write a screenplay. Do you think that is intelligent advice? Hal Ackerman teaches a graduate screenwriting class at UCLA, the preeminent film school on the planet. Dozens of students have graduated his class and gone on to get their scripts made! The bad thing about these book reviews is that reviewers can post unenlightened reviews like: \\"if he hasn't sold a screenplay\\" how can he teach it.Also look at: \\"Screenwriting: A Sequence Approach\\". Excellent!"},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"Mr. Ackerman's direct, no nonsense way is clear and precise with just enough levity to make it go down easy. Unlike so many armchair academics, his methodology has been field tested through his years as a director of the Professional Program in Screenwriting at UCLA and as a screenwriter and playwright himself. I've taken the UCLA program and have participated in both his workshop and his lecture series. Hal cuts through the philosophy and gets right to the nuts and bolts."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"UCLA attracts teaching talent, and Ackerman is one of the best. Most screenwriting books cover similar topics, but Ackerman adds his own insight to the basics. His credits include a long list of successful students.

It's a lot cheaper than going to UCLA!"},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I met Hal Ackerman several years ago, and was immediately impressed with his charm and intelligence. I recently obtained a copy of his book, and from page one, I was astonished. I'm a professional writer - best selling novelist, a veteran screenwriter and journalist who has features for Playboy and San Francisco Magazine - and am the instructor of Advanced Screenwriting and Television at the Academy of Arts in San Francisco. I\\"m of the opinion that writing should be taught by writers: real writers who do this work for a living. Hal Ackerman has had more than a dozen plays produced in New York, has written a terrific novel (Stein, Stoned) and is the head of the Professional Writing Program at UCLA. This book is a marvel. From the minute you start reading, Hal Ackerman goes right at you. He attacks the fraudulent missives that pass for screenwriting these days, and provides ream after ream of smart, articulate, insightful information about the art and craft of writing for the screen. The end of each chapter offers an exercise that actually keys you into the demands of writing for the screen. There are so many ridiculous books on screenwriting that the stream has become polluted by The Plot Princess and the Structure God and the Exposition Emperor that I thought no one could break through with a smart, inspring tome on just how to do this challenging work.

This book is the best there is. Ackerman's method is all I need to turn new projects into polished drafts every time.You will not find any gimmicks or promises in this book. You will not find any vagueries about \\"story structure.\\" The Scenogram forces you to BUILD your story structure. Once you take the lifelong pledge to write conflict into every scene, you will never again get confused by whether your story should be character driven or plot driven. That becomes crystal clear when you write every scene with WADOGEE.This book tells you how to put the work in, day after day, to get the job done. Plus, it's funny as hell.

It's probably more of a marketing tool to claim that one is a screenwriting &quot;god,&quot; than self-promotion (I should hope). Otherwise, it would be gross arragance. Of course I have known my share of arrogant college professors, but also know many who have actually been out in the real world doing &quot;it.&quot;I liken this over the top promotion to other authors like Syd Field, who much to his discredit, also has just one work noted in IMDB. At least this Lew Hunter (of whom I am not familiar) has a few works out here with his name on them.There are useful tidbits here as well as in Field's work, but the most important thing for writer's proabably to remember, is to have more than one source of inspiration and to write and examine successful works as much as possible. Let others in on your work and see what you can by use of a little vision versus some utility of a specific structured outline coming from one who has more success in touting &quot;success&quot; in a &quot;how-to&quot; book, rather than in the trenches with in actual performance."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I really hate buying a book without looking inside!!!

This guy is crazier than that creepy Lew Hunter &quot;guru.&quot; The book proves to be just one more distraction from actually writing. Feeling unsatisfied at the end of the read, I went to check out his long list of writing credits on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com), but sadly, it doesn't exist. If someone is going to write a book on how to sell a screenplay, and especially if they are going to name the selling technique after themselves, you would think that they had sold more than one script in 1976 about a jogger. If this guy knows how to sell a screenplay &quot;The Ackerman Way,&quot; why hasn't he? And, more importantly, why does he think he can tell me how to do it? And, sorry to go on about this, but I should've know from the start that this book was a mess by the mere fact that on the cover Ackerman boasts, &quot;Revelations of a Remarkable Teacher.&quot; Shame on Ackerman for being so arrogant but shame on me for buying and reading this book."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I've read quite a few screenwriting books, and what I first noticed about this one was its comfortable, clever tone.Some of the really big heavy hitters in screenwriting are too expensive and pretentious. They try and function like textbooks. (I have one book in mind that weighs about 3 pounds and costs about $60... and like many text books, it lost my interest when I fell asleep on page 10.)Hal Ackerman's book isn't very long, and it's an easy, pleasant read -- sort of populist without being condescending. It doesn't take screenwriting too seriously, which I appreciate. At the same time, you get the sense that this UCLA Professor loves helping his students craft meaningful stories that will also sell. (Some of his past students have gone on to write scripts like Matchstick Men and A Walk on the Moon.)This book's real strength lies in its dedication to helping writers build effective narratives. Ackerman has designed an index card technique called the Scene-o-Gram that helps writers diagram stories so that key emotional turning points and plot points are hit at regular intervals. This forces you to keep only what you need and to lose the rest. Since most writers suffer from wordiness and a total lack of editing abilities, a stringent guide like this is a godsend.I am an aspiring screenwriter who recently hit a block and stopped writing for several weeks. My romantic comedy is a mixed up mess and my zombie movie hit page 60 before I realized I had no ending. I think this is because I'm relatively new and haven't yet internalized the rhythms of effective storytelling.After reading this book, I feel like I have the concrete tools I need to help me finish my scripts. I'd describe the book as a method to reign in your madness. Nobody's saying you have to treat your scripts like calculated, mechanical schemes to make money, but the reality is that a screenplay without structure and pacing will bore its audience. It'll never get made. A certain amount of planning will save you time and benefit your writing in the long run.Bottom line: this book is a great resource for anyone who's overwhelmed by the task at hand. I think it's equally valuable for beginner or intermediate writers."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I got this book just a couple of weeks ago, and I will admit openly that i am not done reading it, but I have read a lot of it, and he definitely knows what he's talking about. Hal Ackerman's book includes information on proper script format that a lot of other books leave out.I'll also say that he doesn't sugar coat things for you, he tells you some real hard learned and down to earth facts about the film writing industry and states in no uncertain terms what your chances really are at making it big, getting recognition and what rights you have to your work once its made. I would rather learn about that from him then to learn it the hard way after I submitted my script. He also tells you about the usefulness of script writing software, among other things.To me it's not really an air of arrogance about his tone, as stated in some other reviews, but an air of realism where he informs you that writing a movie is serious business.One thing that may throw a lot of people off in this book is that he tells you that you must \\"practice at screen writing\\" in order to actually be good at it and the book contains exercises at the end of each chapter (writers gym) for you to build your skills.I wouldn't say that it's a distraction from doing real writing as one reveiwer stated, but something that you must do in order to sharpen your skills. Many other writing books say and include the same thing, and I see nothing amiss here.All writing takes dedication and work, and thanks to Hal Ackerman we have a very useful guide that not only tells us the truth about screen writing, but helps us to get into it. The four star rating for this book is not deserved, five stars. Also if you're still not sure if you want to buy this book check it out of your local library first and read a bit of it for yourself (I did and I am now fervently seeking to own a copy of it permanently). Then you can see if it's for you."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"This really is a great book. It is filled with practical, useful, helpful information that makes it much easier to sit down and be productive. The author's sense of humor also makes it a fun read.It all makes sense after you read it and then start to do it yourself. I can see why so many people have been successful using this guy's method."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"Hal Ackerman is one of the most outstanding writing instructors in one of the world's best film schools (UCLA). He is a devotee of classical dramatic structure and can help you wrestle your crazed wanderings into clarity and a graceful shape. He is a master at it and it has earned him a devoted following at UCLA. His methods are clear and easy to use and your work will be a billion times better for it. Many best-selling writers around town have Ackerman to thank for helping them become the successes they are."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"Author Hal Ackerman's a longtime UCLA film professor whose particular distinction is that an inordinately high proportion of his former students have actually sold their scripts to Hollywood. While there are some excellent books on screenwriting out there (and what writer wouldn't actually prefer to read yet another book about writing rather than actually have to write a book or script himself!) Ackerman's all about getting your script finished and sold. Make room on your shelf for this one."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"In this book, he begins by being both, honest and inspiring about the art. He explains how we can awake the screenwriter within; the reasons and excuses why we don't write and why we write; what is and what isn't a screenplay. Then he explains the Big Picture, referring to the structure, and then the small picture or scene writing. Ackerman is very clear in going step by step to make you a better writer. He demystifies most of what we consider the Gospel in writing and suggests ways to make a screenplay better. How to research, and making the rewrite. In short, what we have to do to step up in the ladder of screenwriting: a mix of inspiration, writing and an unstoppable desire to step up.A very inspiring book that promises we will be on our way if we follow the steps to better screenwriting.Don't be misleaded by the negative comments that argument the author isn't a produced screenwriter. If you think for a while on the subject, most of the best teachers and trainers are great in teaching and making students get the most of the subject they are teaching or coaching, but they are not that good in the craft. Oddly as it sounds, they can get students to understand and excel in the most complicated issues, but they can't do it themselves. Most sport coaches weren't outstanding themselves in their sport, but have a deep understanding of how the game should be played, one exception could be Beckenbauer, the German soccer star player and coach, who was extraordinary both as a player as a coach, and yes there are more exceptions, but the point is: it doesn't matter if you are the best on the field you are teaching, what does matter is if you are the best in how good you understand the subject, and how good you can transfer that knowledge to the student. I think Ackerman is both a good writer and a good teacher, but his passion for teaching and seing his students hit the big screen is greater than his passion for writing."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"Just read this book and found it be an excellent approach to screenwriting: clear and concise, logical and intuitive, and very inspiring. What Ackerman has done with this book is truly noteworthy. He has provided a working methodology that is based on actual writing, not theory. This is a craftsman's approach to screenwriting that allows room for art, inspiration, and true creativity to shine through. It is, perhaps, the best book on screenwriting there is, and probably the only one you'll ever need. Bravo. I was so impressed by this book that I decided to write a review on it, and even read the other reviews first. While I agree with most of them, I take exception with one of them--a review written by someone who clearly never even read the book. So, in fairness, I'm going to review that review.\\"My brainwashed friend at UCLA told me that I had to get this book, so I did. This guy is crazier than that creepy Lew Hunter \\"guru.\\"\\"The reviewer starts by insulting UCLA, as brainwashing, and then claims to have read Ackerman's book anyway. Sure. The reviewer then goes on to insult another UCLA Professor, Lew Hunter. Why the axe to grind against UCLA? From what I understand, UCLA has produced some of the best writers working in the film industry: Alexander Payne, Ed Solomon, David Koepp, Paul Schrader, Shane Black, Allison Anders, Francis Ford Coppola, Eric Roth, Pamela Gray, Sacha Gervasi, Josefina Lopez, etc.\\"The book proves to be just one more distraction from actually writing.\\"It's not a distraction from writing, but a clear guide into writing, as one who actually read it can attest. Seems to me the real distraction to writing is grousing about: ones's friend, Ackerman and his book, Lew Hunter, and UCLA.\\"Feeling unsatisfied at the end of the read, I went to check out his long list of writing credits on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com), but sadly, it doesn't exist.\\"One can only wonder why this reviewer didn't check the IMDB before supposedly reading the book; if screen credits are to be used as the major criteria for choosing a book on screenwriting.\\"If someone is going to write a book on how to sell a screenplay, and especially if they are going to name the selling technique after themselves, you would think that they had sold more than one script in 1976 about a jogger.\\"Really? Seems to me that having sold one script, that was produced, already puts Ackerman far ahead most of the rest of the pack. As do Ackerman's: stage, TV, public-service, industrial, teaching, and other professional credits. Perhaps the reviewer needs to futher develop their own research skills.\\"If this guy knows how to sell a screenplay \\"The Ackerman Way,\\" why hasn't he?\\"He has sold a screenplay \\"The Ackerman Way,\\" according to the reviewer, it was a script about a jogger in 1976, remember? Again, Ackerman has also: had plays produced, written for TV, sold features to major studios, and been published in literary journals.\\"And, more importantly, why does he think he can tell me how to do it?\\"Because, since 1985, he's taught an endless number of other people to do it at UCLA, whose Alumni dominate both TV and features. Because, he not only teaches Master's Degree level screenwriting at UCLA, he also single-handedly runs the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting, and teaches at Hollins University over the summer. Because, he knows a lot more about screenwriting than you do or ever will.\\"And, sorry to go on about this, but I should've know from the start that this book was a mess by the mere fact that on the cover Ackerman boasts, \\"Revelations of a Remarkable Teacher.\\"\\"This is the most telling comment the reviewer made, as it proves the reviewer never read or even saw the book. Nowhere on or in this book does Ackerman boast, \\"Revelations of a Remarkable Teacher.\\" Not on the cover, nor in the text. The review is a fake.\\"Shame on Ackerman for being so arrogant but shame on me for buying and reading this book.\\"No, shame on the reviewer for writing a fake review on a book that has helped me and my entire writing group so much. Shame on the reviewer for having claimed to have bought and read a book that they have clearly never even seen. Shame on the reviewer for venting their bitter little spleen on Hal Ackerman, Lew Hunter, UCLA, and on their own imaginary \\"brainwashed friend.\\"I'm guessing someone didn't get into UCLA."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I've spent my professional life directing actors, and a good number of my leisure hours watching plays and films. But whenever I've tried to compose so much as a single exchange of believable dialogue, the characters always wind up sounding like me, and the themes always hit the page with the subtelty of a sledgehammer. The one time I did find the courage to enroll in a college course on playwrighting, the instructor assigned us a two-character, one page scene due the second session. I dropped the class the next day.So the current everybody-does-it trend notwithstanding, I am hardly the guy likely to sit down and script a full-length feature film.And yet. Were I ever to be seized by an irresistible impulse to author a screenplay, this is the book I'd return to,digesting and re-digesting every insightful page. Like any book that attempts to teach a subject (calculus, woodworking, photography), this is, after all, a textbook. But it's literally the first one I've ever encountered that was nothing less than exhilarating to read, with all the forward momentum of a good narrative. Ackerman is never ponderous or didactic, and his prose never stinks of the academy. My sense is rather of a guy who--like any gifted teacher--passionately wants the student to succeed, and is willing to share any and all of his best secrets in order to make that happen (and happen it has, for an amazingly high proportion of his former students!)His book has all the qualities of a winner in this already crowded field: immense readability, a playful and infectious sense of humor, a refreshing concreteness (I love the fact that in citing examples of successful screenplays, he mentions big pop blockbusters like &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot; as often as he does 'chic' European titles like &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;.), and--maybe most importantly--a sense that the author is standing by, doing his damndest to get the best out of you."},{"Title":"Write Screenplays That Sell: The Ackerman Way","review":"I loved this book.

On the one hand, it's hard to agree with Hawthorne's argument that \\"the objectionable characteristics seem to be a parasitic growth, having no connection with the original fable.\\" On the other hand, the six bowdlerized stories, like the predecessors still \\"raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood, in order to re-create the original myths.\\" In recasting these tales, then, Hawthorne has made something new and rather glorious out of them.The stories as a group are not as well-known to young readers as those in the earlier volume. You'll find the Minotaur and the labyrinth, as well as Jason and the Golden Fleece. But there are also Hercules and the Pygmies, Cadmus and the famous dragon's teeth (which have inspired as many literary references as they had spawned soldiers), Ulysses and the sorcery of Circe (book 10 of \\"The Odyssey\\"), and the abduction (sans rape) of Proserpina by Pluto.Gone are the interludes found in the earlier volume that described a horde of precocious neighborhood children encouraging and teasing their young narrator, Eustace Bright. Instead, Hawthorne presents them as polished manuscripts that had been honed and approved by the children, who are \\"even more delighted with the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have already been given to the world.\\" The stories are wondrous, in no small part because they are not as familiar. One drawback, however--as a cursory examination of the six subjects hints--is that each tale carries on a bit about the journeys that lead to the adventure; some children might feel these stories feature less action and more questing.

A very nice feature is that he gives proofs to all the results in commutative algebra used by Robin Hartshorne's popular &quot;Algebraic Geometry,&quot; making them a nice pair of books to read together.I found this to be useful as a reference as well as a text.

I almost always find that it is the best place to learn any of the material covered.This book belongs on the shelf of anyone learning algebraic geometry, although it will spend plenty of time off the shelf as well."},{"Title":"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry","review":"If one is interested in taking on a thorough study of algebraic geometry, this book is a perfect starting point. The writing is excellent, and the student will find many exercises that illustrate and extend the results in each chapter. Readers are expected to have an undergraduate background in algebra, and maybe some analysis and elementary notions from differential geometry. Space does not permit a thorough review here, so just a brief summary of the places where the author has done an exceptional job of explaining or motivating a particular concept:(1) The history of commutative algebra and its connection with algebraic geometry, for example the origin of the concept of an &quot;ideal&quot; of a ring as generalizing unique factorization.(2) The discussion of the concept of localization, especially its origins in geometry. A zero dimensional ring (collection of &quot;points&quot;) is a ring whose primes are all maximal, as expected.(3) The theory of prime decomposition as a generalization of unique prime factorization. Primary decomposition is given a nice geometric interpretation in the book.(4) Five different proofs of the Nullstellensatz discussed, giving the reader good insight on this important result.(5) The geometric interpretation of an associated graded ring corresponding to the exceptional set in the blowup algebra.(6) The notion of flatness of a module as a continuity of fibers and a test for this using the Tor functor.(7) The characterization of Hensel's lemma as a version of Newton's method for solving equations. The geometric interpretation of the completion as representing the properties of a variety in neighborhoods smaller than Zariski open neighborhoods.(8) The characterization of dimension using the Hilbert polynomial.(9) The fiber dimension and the proof of its upper semicontinuity.(10) The discussion of Grobner bases and flat families. Nice examples are given of a flat family connecting a finite set of ideals to their initial ideals.(11) Computer algebra projects for the reader using the software packages CoCoA and Macaulay.(12) The theory of differentials in algebraic geometry as a generalization of what is done in differential geometry.(13) The discussion of how to construct complexes using tensor products and mapping cones in order to study the Koszul complex.(14) The connection of the Koszul complex to the cotangent bundle of projective space.(15) The geometric interpretation of the Cohen-Macauley property as a map to a regular variety."},{"Title":"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry","review":"People tend to have strong feelings about this book. In my opinion, the people who dislike it are those who expect it to be like a typical graduate-level math book. This book is extremely atypical for a math book; it's not meant to be read linearly, and the topics in it do not follow a typical logical dependency. Personally, I find it to be outstanding; my only complaint about it is that I wish there were more books like it!Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are extremely difficult subjects requiring a great deal of background. This book is written as a sort of intermediary text between introductory abstract algebra books with a full and exposition of algebraic structures, and advanced, highly technical texts that can be difficult to follow and grasp on a technical level. As such, this book focuses on developing intuition, and discussing the history and motivation behind the various mathematical structures presented. It assumes that most of the other aspects of the subject, including both the elementary expositions, and the more advanced technical details, can be found elsewhere (although, believe me, this book certainly has its share of both elementary expositions and advanced technical details!)I think this book is actually better for self-study than for use as a textbook. Most of the people I have known who have used it as a textbook have been frustrated with it. Either way, it needs to be supplemented by other books. Personally, on algebra, I like the Dummit and Foote, Isaacs, and Lang books. Those three books have very little overlap with each other, and very little overlap with this book, and they offer a very useful difference of perspectives where they do overlap! I also would recommend reading the more elementary book by Cox, Little, and O'Shea, which can help you get a feel for the subject of algebraic geometry. Many people see this book's primary purpose as preparation for Robin Hartshorne's \\"Algebraic Geometry\\". I can't say, however, how effective it is at that purpose, as no matter how far I get in this book, all but a few sections from that book still remain quite far beyond my grasp."},{"Title":"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry","review":"These springer print on demand books should be labelled low quality for their paper and print.

You should definitely read it.My low rating pertains specifically to the paperback binding. This book is 800 pages long, and despite being printed on what appears to be very thin paper the book is twice as thick as nearly any other book I own. The paperback binding simply isn't up to the task of holding the book together -- if you read anything that isn't in the middle couple of chapters, it develops permanent creases. I expect my copy will have fallen completely apart within a month or so.Honestly, this book should have been split into two volumes or something, because the current size is absurdly unwieldy.

So this review is less about the specifics of the content, but about the general style.First, it is a delight to read. The clarity is excellent. It's understood that part of the clarity is based on reader's background! I didn't major in mathematics, and mine is an effort to (try to) learn some aspects of commutative algebra. Even with that sort of limited background of a beginner, I was able to tread through the material - as far as I read.Second, the motivation and historical backgrounds are fantastic. Especially for someone who may not know a lot about connections with other areas, this was a great help in putting things in perspective. One downside is that it makes the chapter a little more verbose than it needs to be for a quick access. But then for me it was a virtue; someone else may not find it so.Finally, the book doesn't have a strict linear flow. So it is somewhat easier, especially for an expert, to just pick a chapter and start reading it. A feature that I enjoy a lot in general, although I am not an expert in this area by any stretch."},{"Title":"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry","review":"I purchased this as a book of reference.

Although you are forced to check them on the paper, I think it is very good for the study. Also, you need a professor to instruct you, because in math, any language could only express the part of the oringins. Anyway, algebraic geometry is the course that you have to have a good professor to help you, otherwise stop study this field. In one word, it is a very very good book, so read it slowly!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective","review":"These stories are unusual for Agatha Christie in that they are well-thought-out and well-written. Much of her more popular stuff, particularly Poirot and Marple, was dashed off to keep things on the boil and many of them are, in my view, not worth reading. The Parker Pyne stories are different, but I will never understand why he is referred to as a detective. This gentleman is a former British Civil Servant who sets up an agency - an agency to help people with their problems - real or imaginary. So, I guess he's a bit like an agony aunt, but his solutions are real! For example, he fixes it for people very bored with their lives to have some excitement - using actors - but it seems real to the individual. He sorts out errant husbands - and wives, he even finds a way to make a miserable wealthy woman happy, living in relative poverty. Parker Pyne has a novel approach to fees, he charges what people can afford to pay. This is usually done by getting the client to unwittingly perform some service for a paying customer. In some cases this leads to the client getting paid! All in all, these are little morality plays, handled with great humour, skill, and compassion. They may be a bit innocent for modern tastes but I have read them many times and still enjoy them. Sex and violence are not essential to a good read. There are 14 stories in all, so find an edition that has them all if you can."},{"Title":"Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective","review":"Agatha - always a favorite.

The most important chemical and physical properties of the elements can be found - without turning a page. All properties are presented in the form of tables or graphs. More than 40 properties are given, ranging from melting point and heat capacity to atomic radius, nuclear spin, electrical resistivity and abundance in the solar system. Sixteen of the most important properties are colour coded, so that they may be followed through the periodic system at a glance. Twelve properties have been selected to illustrate periodicity, while separate plots illustrate the relation between properties. In addition, there are special sections dealing with units, fundamental constants and particles, radioisotopes, the Aufbau principle, etc. All data on the chart are fully referenced, and S.I. units are used throughout.Designed specifically for university and college undergraduates and high school students, \`\`Elsevier's Periodic Table of the Elements'' will also be of practical value to professionals in the fields of fundamental and applied physical sciences and technology.

I think it is very cool toput together those 3 movies and i cannot wait to read it"},{"Title":"Aliens vs. Predator vs. Terminator","review":"Well I can't deny it...i absolutely love the Alien, Predator and Terminator. So when I heard of the crossover that pit all 3 against each other, I was thrilled...until I bought it and read it, that is.This is probably the most convoluted and bizarre story yet in the Aliens vs. Predator universe. It hardly consists of any of the 3 fighting each other at all...at least not to the extent of which the cover and blurb on the back would have one assume. The story tells of John Connor and the resistance defeating Skynet, only to have Skynet reawakened years later by Terminators that have gone into deep cover, posing as scientists. To assure victory, samples of Alien DNA have been used to construct a new generation of Terminator, which the Predators see as a great threat of war.If it sounds ridiculous...it is. The story is bizarre and goes in all different directions. And worse yet...it spins off of Alien: Resurrection. That alone makes me not like this comic, aside from the bizarre story and sub-par artwork. The story even has Ripley 'become' a Predator. So...she's human, she's Alien, and now she's Predator. The book just gets worse and worse as you go on.I suppose if you are a fan of any or all of the characters, like I am, it should pique your interest. But the sloppy and senseless story combined with the elements that made Resurrection such a bad movie, not to mention the lack of attention paid to detail both in artwork and in story, just make this comic unreadable. This is a crossover that had so much potential, and it could have been in so many different, better ways...but it turned out to be nothing more than an attempt to throw 3 popular franchises into one book as a cash-graber. Buy this if you are a collector and want it for your collection, but don't bother reading it. Otherwise just stay away from it completely."},{"Title":"Aliens vs. Predator vs. Terminator","review":"AvPvT is a very interesting plot, but the it gets one star off because the Aliens are only featured in three pages at the most, and they weren't drawn as well as the predators or terminators. How do each of the three races fit in the story? The Terminators are using Alien anatomy to perfect their combat effeciency, and the Predators have come in to stop that. The story follows Ripley, after Alien Resurrection. She is forced to follow Call and her friends to infiltrate a military compound to stop the Alien research that is going on there. The mission goes wrong when they encounter a Terminator/Alien hybrid and a band of predators that kill most of the team and cause havoc, and you figure it all out from there. The story was rushed for a book of this length, and a lot of events happen waaay too quickly, and some events take too long. For instance, one part where the team witnesses a terminator/alien hybrid fight a predator takes 12 pages, while an event where two terminator/alien hybrids single handedly attack and destroy 2 military bases, and wipe out an entire fleet of ships takes 10 pages!!!! AvPvT gets a point off for that. However, it gets 3 points for art and creativity. The art is about as close as you'll get to an anime styled AvP comic, it was all well drawn with a lot of effort and very original. The idea of how the story continues off Alien Resurrection is very original, the way the plot uses the three sides is original as well, though the aliens deserved more credit. Its a unique book. If you want an AvP book with unique art and story, this is it. But if you want something with more bite, with more of a realistic yet cinematic feel, consider getting Stronghold."},{"Title":"Aliens vs. Predator vs. Terminator","review":"well, really, the comic art itself is great, the idea is cool if somewhat twisted (hey, we're talking about Dark Horse...), but the plot is absolutely plain stupid.

He was known, in the records of several long-dead regimes, by at least three other pseudonyms, which Cohen interprets as a sign of \\"trauma.\\" That is, the inability to ever know oneself as a singular individual, despite Lind's several published autobiographies which are also our only sources of information about him. When Hitler's annexation of his native Austria shattered his close-knit Jewish family, young Heinz Jakov Landwirth was sent with a sister on the Kindertransport to the Netherlands. Infuriated at what he perceived to be the \\"complacency\\" of the Dutch Jews, \\"Jan Overbeek\\" eventually went underground as a bargeman. After a bout of clap from a prostitute, Overbeek found new work as a personal courier for the German Institute for Metallurgical Research of the Imperial Air Ministry of Traffic. (Posing as a Nazi is really an unconscious act, Lind later said, one merely \\"nods and obeys, one adapts.\\") In 1945, \\"Jakov Chaklan,\\" Palestinian Jew (!), left for Israel, where life on a kibbutz merely annoyed him, as did religion. He then made his way back to London, where he would remain until his death in 2007. Throughout his life, \\"Jakov Lind\\" would hold many occupations, including photographer, fruit-picker, air-traffic controller, actor, private detective, journalist, and literary/film agent. He was married twice.\\"Landscape in Concrete,\\" Lind's famous tale of tragedy and absurdity, concerns one Gauthier Bachman, a giant oaf of a German soldier who is also the sole survivor of a regiment that got drowned in mud. He is subsequently declared mentally unfit to serve. But Bachman's ardent determination to support the Fatherland's war effort is undiminished and, having been released/escaped from a Polish sanitarium, he has now begun a quest to locate and join any regiment willing to take him. Along the way, however, instead of an idealized mission of duty and purpose, he is repeatedly abused, manipulated, and humiliated into acting in ways contrary to both his nature and (supposedly) that of civilized society. From Peter von G&ouml;ritz, the stylish homosexual sergeant, to murderous psychopath Hjalmar Halftan and lecherous police chief Heinz-Otto Muschel, a dominant running theme is the corruption of power and the frightening ways in which authority figures can use it to influence their subordinates. (Similarly, in Stanley Krubrick's film \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" it is unanimously agreed that Colonel Jack Ripper has gone completely nuts, yet no one seems to question the psychological health of General Buck Turgidson, who delights in spectacularly destructive military action.) \\"[A]fter all,\\" says Cohen, \\"the Holocaust was legal, as are most wars.\\" In other words, as \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" also makes quite clear, the definition of sanity and criminal behavior depends purely on context.The perversion of language and distortion of meaning in \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" is also reminiscent of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel \\"Catch-22\\" (also about World War II). Both books explore the illogical madness of war and the cognitive dissonance inherent to its various acts of institutionalized horror. Heller's hero Yossarian is told that, in order to be discharged from duty he must be proven mentally unfit (like Bachman). Unfortunately, the very act of trying to be discharged is indicative of a sound mind, as no normal human being would ever want to go into combat. Likewise, when Bachman begs to be reinstated despite his many issues, he is told that a \\"war can only be fought with sound men. The highest demands are made on every individual, it takes nerves of steel. We have to do things that may not be to our liking. Yes, sometimes we have to do violence to our own nature. Most of the duties a war imposes on us, Sergeant Bachman, are revolting, let's face it, insane, and yet the soldier who performs them has to fully responsible.\\" The collapse of solid meaning in language is visualized through Bachman's distaste for the chaos of trees, rocks, and mountains, as well as his desire for the transformation of the natural landscape into one of concrete: flattened, paved-over, bombed to oblivion. All he wants to do is serve his nation and obey his orders, but it is this naive yearning that is gradually transforming him into a monster at the hands of others.Though undeniably thought-provoking, \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" is also a very intense tale that can be difficult to read. I was even forced to skip a couple of pages during the scene in which Halftan has Bachman murder a family simply because it got so gruesome. Overall, Lind is certainly a talented writer whose narrative shifts smoothly between horror and pitch black humor. A common literary criticism is that a particular book could have been shorter; here, however, I feel that \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" probably should have been longer, especially given the comparatively weak third act where I felt the storyline became rather confused. (Like, what was the deal with the lesbian-landlord-gynecologist? That weird little subplot just had me going, \\"Huh?\\") \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" is nevertheless an important literary addition to library of World War II and Holocaust writings, as it forces the reader to both sympathize with and revile a hapless protagonist-turned-\\"criminal\\" and demands that we examine within ourselves that same capacity for mindless, befuddled obedience.Also recommended: Victor Serge's \\"Unforgiving Years\\" and Tod Strasser's \\"The Wave.\\"* Review copy *"},{"Title":"Landscape in Concrete;","review":"The introduction by Joshua Cohen provides a helpful reminder that this well respected novelist of post-World War II German literature spent his adolescence in various parts of Northern Europe during the war years and after, trying to fashion a semblance of a life as a stateless, nameless, Jew. Or more accurately, an individual of Jewish ancestry who passed through several countries, occupations and names. As a result, his view of the world is scattered and macabre. Every day brings something different, and it is probably extremely odd and illogical.The main character in this novella is a humble giant of a German soldier trying to return to active duty with his regiment, or in fact any Nazi regiment, because that is his duty. He is humble, loyal and obedient. He is also a homicidal psychopath. He kills four innocents during the book, and has killed hundreds previously. But always on orders, and orders can not be disobeyed. Who exactly gives the orders doesn't matter. He is a gold and silver smith in civilian life, the last of a long, long line of men proud of their guild membership. But the only gold he has is his marksmanship metal, the designation tied to his current \\"trade\\" as killer.The oddity of this book isn't in the plot or in the complete amorality oozing from each and every character. Nope, it is the jaunty style in which this dark tale is told. Hey you...come on over. I need some help with this. Now take the knife and slit him from the neck down. Nice job. Now here's another, quick, quick.I assume the point of all this jauntiness amide the sex (mostly repressed) and violence (not so repressed) is to convey the upside-down world of life in Germany during the war years, and particularly the immorality of civilians who are able to justify anything as necessary or expedient. At least our psychopath is serving a supposedly greater good...Hitler.I find the whole thing less than cohesive, and the tone wears thin way before this short volume finishes. The lack of introspection makes the whole book some sort of insane nursery tale. I agree with the quote from a review in the TLS calling it \\"[a] berserk fairy-tale whose macabre episodes are shot through with allegorical meaning.\\" But the exact dimensions of that allegory are hard to decipher."},{"Title":"Landscape in Concrete;","review":"Sometimes war is all one knows. \\"Landscape in Concrete\\" is a novel following one Gauthier Bachmann, an ideal solider under the Nazi regime.

I have a copy of the 1940 edition.The first three chapters deal with his theory as to the origin of the Hebrew people, and cannot be said to be really history. It is simply theory - which largely departs from the Biblical narrative- without any real proof or substance. Yet it is an interesting theory nonetheless.The author puts more stock on Assyrian and Moabite accounts of ancient Hebrew history than on Hebrew accounts, and there is no real reason for this.The theory which Sachar puts forward here seems to have been a popular one , and was later taken up by Howard Fast in his \`The Jews : Story Of A People'.Sachar go's on to document the history of Israel, with accounts of the reigns of King David and Solomon, the two kingdoms in the north and south, the Prophets, the revolt of the Maccabees, the Roman occupation and the destruction of Jerusalem and exile of most of the Jews from Israel by the Romans.What follows is the experiences of the Jews in Europe, through the centuries, the travails and persecutions in Spain, Germany and Poland. The contributions of the Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn, right up to the beginnings of the holocaust, and the rising of the Phoenix from the ashes of the Nation of Zion.The State of Israel represents the hope after years of pain, of the Jewish people.

The characters are sympathetic, but not portrayed as in any way approaching perfection. Both defects and virtues are presented in a natural, real way. They are more than mere cardboard figures manipulated by the author.Both hero and heroine are strong characters, but although they of course they are obviously set to clash over the Belevedere Tower, they do not behave with pig-headed stupidity. As all too often does occur in historical romance fiction.True, there is a strong element of melodrama with Cassandra's husband's violent return, but it was not foolishly far-fetched.Daniel was particularly well rounded, for in the beginning he definitely had forfeited some reader sympathy by is treatment of his mistress.

In this novel you will find a very lovely romance, adventure, and witness a wonderful relationship between father and son. This book is great for all reading age levels. There is nothing but good wholesome values found in this novel."},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"\\"The Hive\\" is the story of a coffee shop in Spain, frequented by a wide assortment of every-day Spanish citizens. It is an interesting narrative of colorful characters. There are a few tense moments when one realizes the fact that this is the Spain of Franco's rule, and a character runs afoul of the authorities once or twice, but by and large, this is a normal novel with an interesting story to tell. It is enjoyable to read and nice to follow the various characters, but Cela will remind the astute reader in a very subtle fashion, but an unequivocal one, that this is Franco's Spain, an isolated universe of political peril, giving this novel a second tier, a dark cloud which overhangs the proceedings. Readers who enjoy the multivarious tales of small town inhabitants and their common taverns, or readers who enjoy stories of early twentieth-century Spain will enjoy this story particularly."},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"In &quot;The Hive&quot;, a most appropriate title, Cela recreates the everyday life of Madrid in the 1940's, centered around a small cafe and the life of its employees and clients. This place is the real protagonist of the novel, as we are witnesses to the small tragedies, triumphs, fights and passions of the people who live around it. It is verily a hive, an endless show of life with all its grandiosity, sordidness, pettiness and small acts of love and redemption. For those who know the modern-day Madrid, a cosmopolitan, prosperous place, it should be reminded that this book portrays the city right after the bitter Spanish Civil War, during the first days of Franco's dictatorship. Under Franco, Spain was a poor, provincial, backwards place where the most primitve form of Roman Catholicism was the religion of state, where the Catholic Church reigned supreme and where political repression was everywhere. Life wasn't easy in Spain in those days, and though this is not by any means a political novel, it is useful to remember this as we look at the lives of the many characters in this moving and excellent story."},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"The Hive is the best known work by the Spanish novelist and 1989 Nobel Laureate, Camilo Jose Cela. It's set in Madrid during World War II and in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Cela's intent was to show us a panoramic view of the sufferings of the lower-middle class after the war. To do this, he gives us over 300 character in a series of over 200 short scenes, about one every page or two. They are many scenes in cafes, at homes, on the street. There are romances, affairs, arguments, deceptions--in other words, every slice of life. The scenes act like film exposures, and it's through the repetition of themes and emotions that we get the overall effect Cela is going for. The characters work together, like a hive of bees, to show us more about post-Civil War Spanish society through their interactions than any one of them could individually.At first, I enjoyed how the book flowed, and didn't mind the choppy structure. Occasionally I would have to go back and re-read a character's previous scene to remember who they were, but that didn't bother me much. I understood what Cela was trying to do, and was interested to see how it would play out. As the book proceeded however, I actually became less interested in what was happening. I eventually came to realize that the chapters are out of time sequence, and I never really figured out why, or what that was supposed to add to the experience. At the end of the novel, I was still flipping back to re-read some parts to understand where I was. I suppose I spent most of the novel waiting for something big to happen. But nothing ever does. This novel is truly a reflection of these lives and their times, with all its banality. So in that sense, it's a social novel, whose intent is more to educate than entertain.With that in mind, this book isn't for everybody. I read it because I try to read at least one book from each of the Nobel winners. Unless you're really interested in Spanish history, or the art of novel composition, I'd skip this book."},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"For me Cela is one of the best Spaniard authors ever. This novel is a master piece. The only advice I can give you is: read it!"},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"A masterpiece -- and a superb translation."},{"Title":"The Hive","review":"&quot;La Colmena&quot; pasar&aacute; a la historia como la obra hispana contempor&aacute;nea m&aacute;s estudiada en las Universidades Americanas.

I read everything he writes!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"My Bible teacher gave us an assignment to read one of the books that he recommended for this quarter. I choose &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; because it looked like an easy book to read. It interested me that it was a collection of letters about a married life that a father wrote to his daughter. I was told that it might be too old and boring, but actually I found it very absorbing as I read it. The Dad in the letters talks to his daughter very respectably with deep thoughts. He talks about many different struggles incidental to a married couple and gives good examples based on his experiences. Each of chapters taught me some new lessons that I would have never even thought about if somebody did not tell me. Of course, I am not going to be married to someone right now, but those little tips were good to know because I probably will be married someday. I wish I could get some advice like them from my own Dad, but I am from a broken home, and I know that I probably will not. At least now I know where to find some guidance for marriage if I needed some. I think, if there is someone like me, it would be nice for them to read this book. I also want to encourage others who are not from a home like mine just because it might be helpful for them too!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"In the book, &quot;Letters to Karen,&quot; the author Charlie W. Shedd gave some basic guidelines for a sucessful marriage. The points in which he made were very good and did not appear to be unreasonable. There are many books which appear to be strick and unrealistic, their ideas for a sucessful mariage seem to be impossible to acheive, but &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; are not. For example, in the chapter &quot;Emphasis on Good Things,&quot; Shedd emhpasises how we should concentrate on the positive &quot;gradually cancling out the bad and raising up the good.&quot; One reason that I like the book &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; so much is because it was written from a christan's point of view. Charlie W. Shed is a pasture who has experience in the areas of marriage for he has helped counsel other married couples and also been himself, this book isn't written from an unexperienced person but a person who has been through many married situations and troubles of his own and of others. In &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; is written by the love of a father to his daughter, this gives it a very heart warming feeling. So if you are interested looking at some advice on marriage from a christian view point I highly recommend reading &quot;Letters to Karen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was a wonderful book.

Some of the author's ideas were a little old-fashioned, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like the idea of the husband being chivalrous. Also, I like how straightforward and honest he is in this book, telling his daughter personal stories of his marriage and giving good advice from his experience. This is a very good book for any girl to read, whether she is getting married soon or not."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"&quot;Letters to Karen&quot; by Charlie W. Shedd, was full of interesting information and real life examples. This book was not hard to read and goes quickly.It is also for all ages. I enjoyed reading this book because of all the words of wisdom Mr. Shedd explained from all of his personal stories. One of the most important point he brought up for Karen was that communication within marriage is extremly crucial. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives at all times. Within good communication, also includes apologizing to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but it is a requirement for a good marriage. The fact that Karen's father took time to give real encouragement to her about marriage is an example of parental affection and religious faith. While reading the book, I could really tell that he loved Karen with all his heart and would do anything for her. A godly marriage will take time to perfect but it is possible. If one has the strength of God's love, you can overcome anything. Overall, this book will one day help me a better wife to my husband. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's wonderful book to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Although this book may appear to be old-fashioned in many readers eyes, I believe it contains vauluable advice that can be applied in all relationships, not just husband and wife. The author was married for 27 years at the time these letters were written, so he knows what he is talking about. The main emphasis of the book is how to maintain peace and comfort within the relationship, even through hard times. The advice given is very practical. For example, one chapter is devoted to &quot;Tell Him He's Wonderful&quot;. It is simple yet so often neglected by married couples because wives assume their husbands can read their minds. Shedd also lays out guidelines for communication, such as don't use the terms &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot; in arguements, make greetings pleasant instead of with the worst news from the day, and give each other space on bad days and try to figure out how to pull your spouse out of the bad mood rather than join him. I also agreed with Shedd in the chapters &quot;We Know in Part&quot; and &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;. I like how he describes marriage as growing individually in unity, meaning to maintain your own identity and have things you like to do just for yourself, in order to make the time together more precious. The only sections I did not particularly care for was his advice on housekeeping and cooking and other household duties, because I think that those things are trivial and vary with circumsatnces and personalities. I would recommend this book to anyone who is about to be married or would like to in the future, as I believe there is something for everyone in this book. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I think this book is excellent, its a real encouagement and good help for a godly marriage. It gives real live examples of married couples and there struggles. I am only 18 years old and have no plans to get married any time soon but I sometimes worry about what problems I am going to face. In reading this book I have been encouraged and assured that in a marriage you can work things out. I also have learned that as a woman of God I need to be a servant to my future husband and love him through every decision he makes no matter if I agree or disagree. I also learned a little bit more from the boys perspective and have become more understanding of them. I really like the fact that this story is about a father writing letters to his daughter. It's good for girls to get godly advice from the men in there lives. Especially there fathers. This book has changed my outlook on marriage. After reading it I am excited for the time in my life when I will experience marriage. That is, if God allows it, which I hope he does. It would be awesome to have the intimate love that comes from a marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker.

Shed provided a lot of good, applicable advice for relationships. It was also very sweet to see how much the author cared for his daughter by teaching her about many aspects of marriage that everyday relationships cannot prepare you for. I thought the chapter, &quot;I'm Sorry, Honey&quot; is an especially good chapter. It is filled with many truths that some people would rather over look. One of those points was the fact that some people find it hard to express regret. If people were more open about the way they truly feel, they would probably be surprised to find that others are fairly understanding. My favorite quote from this book is in this chapter. It says, &quot;'Bigness may never begin unlessn it begins with me'&quot; (p.69). The one subject I did not agree with Shedd on is the role of a submissive woman in marriage. There should be a degree of submissive behavior. However, it seemed to me that the author thought the wife should baby her husband every time he broke a nail or swoon each time his ego needs some support. Spouses should make each other feel loved and cherished, but that just seems a little to fake for me. Another point I strongly agreed with Shedd on is the importance of prayer in marriage. God is the strongest foundation there can be for marriage. If there is no relationship with God, how can He help you? I thought it is really interesting how Shedd said he has never had a married individual or couple come to him for help if they have prayed together. If you have the strength of God's love you can overcome anything.

Charlie W. Shedd unlocks the mysteries of dating and marriage relationships, and gives never seen before insight that would dramatically improve the relationships and lives of many people!! This knowledge has transformed my presupposed ideas of the opposite sex, and refreshed my views of a great and working relationship. This book is a MUST READ for all those in romantic relationships, or those who plan to be in one. This will encourage every girl who reads it!!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Overall, I would rate Letters to Karen very high. I thought that it was packed full of good advice covering a variety of topics such as sexual relations, communications, and cooking. Every wife needs a few helpful hints. It definitely pushes the point that God needs to be the center of a relationship; then the inevitable trials will only strengthen one's marriage. I have to admit though that I am more traditional than the average. Many of the comments made could possibly be offensive to a feminist now days. The short letters made the book enjoyable and easier to read. Especially if someone was interested in a specific topic. I would recommend Letters to Karen to anyone getting married and plan to reread it later."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I thought the book was great, five stars.I especially liked the fact that the father took time to give advice to his daughter about marriage. The book is full of parental affection and religious faith. I agree with Karen's father when he said,&quot;we should look inward at the right time and in the right way&quot;. The father brings up many good points about communication in marriage. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives. A marriage can only become strong when two people learn to communicate about their problems. Another point he brought up is the importance of looking directly into another person's eyes when you speak to them. This can be difficult but it lets the other person know that you are really listening. Karen's father also emphasized the importance of being able to apologize to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but that is a requirement for a good marriage. In the early stages of courtship, people need to first learn to understand each other's prsonalities. They can start to do this by having fun and joking with each other. I thought the most important point of this entire book is the respect that Karen's father had for the sexual relationship between husbands and wives. He stated that SEX IS A SACRAMENT and helps us recall that in his perfectly marvelous way of doing things, the Creator included this wonder of wonders- &quot;male and female created he them.&quot; God deserves our praise for creating good things for us to enjoy, and among the best of his good things is sex. I recommend this book to anyone because it provides good insight into many of the issues of life that we all must face. Good advice is also provided regarding how to work through your problems when you get into trouble."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I recommend Letters to Karen. It is an insightful book with good ideas for &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot;. The book is not only fact and opinion, but Shedd also includes little anecdotes and personal stories to bring his book to life. Shedd is a pastor and therefore writes from the Christian perspective. One of my favorite suggestions he made was having a prayer time with your spouse. He also suggested that when you have your prayer time, you should share your requests and then pray silently. At first, I did not understand why he felt that you should pray silently but he goes on to explain it, and his reasons sound very reasonable. I did not find Shedd's book to be filled with outlandish or impossible suggestions, but instead with applications that are more practical that one can use daily. This book is not only for the married woman, but also for the unmarried. Although, I am not married and have not been able to apply the suggestions that Shedd makes, I do plan to use his ideas in the future. By reading about trials that arise and ways to overcome those trials, one can see that marriage is not only a fun, lovey-dovey thing, but also something that requires selflessness, prayer, and commitment."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was an excellent book. So many times we read books about how our relationships are supposed to be, and what is supposed to happen. Though these books may have very important points and opinions, they lack the personal touch and intimacy that Letters has. It was refreshing to see that even though Karen was all grown up and on her own, she still listen and considered every piece of advice that her dad had to give. There was something in her dad's voice, so caring and sympathetic. It was almost as if her dad was one of her best girl friends. More and more it is difficult for young adults to \\"not be wise in their own eyes.\\" Instead, we choose to seek advice from our friends, never stopping to think that we need to consult our God and our parents first. I found communication to be the central theme of this book. Letters helps set up guidelines when arguing, consoling, or just having a conversation. In addition, I liked how Shedd emphasized that the little things are just as important as the big things. Everyone is so caught up in getting things done, that we hardly ever take the time to make sure that we get it done right! Overall I thought that Letters to Karen was an excellent book to read for those involved in a relationship that could quite possibly take that next step to marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Letters to Karen because it answered many questions and gave me so much good information that I can use later on in my life. It is a book I will look to and read over and over again. Though I am not at an age to get married, this book helped me to know what I need and want in my future husband. This book will also help me in preparing to be the best wife I can be when I get married. Shedd gives very good advice which I can apply to my life today. I am so excited for the time when I get married because I now know more about marriage and I know that, though marriage is tough, God can make it the best marriage ever. A key ingredient in marriage, as Shedd writes, is putting God first. Another key to &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot; is putting the other person first. It is important to be the best servant I can be when I am married and reading this book has helped me realize this. Letters to Karen is an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone who ever plans on getting married. It is also helpful for boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and every day relationships as well. I am so glad I read this book because it has given me a whole new outlook on life, love and relationships."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"When entering a marriage relationship or a serious one that might evolve to that level I encourage people to read this book. This book provides helpful and useful adive in all areas of marriage to keep the love alive. This is a touching book from a concerned father with words of wisdom to his daughter. Mr. Shedd has done a wonderful job in capturing the essence of the relationship. Before I began reading this book I wondered how could one MAN know so much about marriage? I began reading with an extremely negative attitude but now that I have read it I see that Shedd has a knowledge of marriage that everyone should learn about. The fact that he is not basing this book solely off what he learned in school but rather from actual life accounts from his own marriage makes this book mean even more. This book discusses many important issues like sex, communication, emphasising on good things, differnces couples go through, and finances. The chapter on communication was most helpful and meaningful to me. Communication is an important aspect to making a marriage work. Although I have never been in a relationship that was as serious as a marriage or even close to, I know that communication can either make or break the relationship. Talking problems out and understanding where each other is coming from will do a world of good. One other part of this book that I found extremely interesting was the way Shedd explains the womans and the mans role in a relationship. Shows the woman her duties to her husband but still shows that it goes both ways. This is a great Christian guide for marriage and keeping God at the center. I would reccommend this book to anyone married or not."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I'm 17 and I wanted to tell others about the book I read, Letter's to Karen. I'm so glad that I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing it. From the moment I opened the book, I was highlighting and writing notes throughout it; things that I especially wanted to remember and use. It has given me a challange, of the kind of wife I want to be for my future husband. As I read, I found myself agreeing with everything Charlie Shedd said. He has so much advice to give and all of it is so true. I did not think any of it was out of date even though it was written over 30 years ago. After watching my parent's marriage, I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistakes. I want God to be the center of my marriage. I know this will be a book I will refere to time and time again. I was telling my boyfriend about it, so he read it also. He was amazed at how right on it was on how guys think. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a good marriage or wants to make theirs even better."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"The intentions of this book, to counsel and give advice on marriage, are wonderful. Many points are made in which I have agreed with. These points were written for the pastor's daughter of Charlie W. Shedd. There were many different good insights given throughout this entire book. He had many good stories and analogies that I am sure I will mostly likely deal with many conflicts in which this book confronts. And what a sweet idea to do for a daughter before she gets married! In marriage, this book would act as a great counselor. However, IN MARRIAGE. I strongly suggest this for being a book someone would want sitting on his or her bookshelf, especially if that person is married. Otherwise, I did find it somehow difficult reading being under the personal fact that I am not hoping to be married for quite sometime. On the bad side, being in a relationship while reading this book caused me to tend to want to put my boyfriend in the &quot;fianc&eacute;&quot; position, which I was really hoping not to do. So, I would suggest that this be read as a book for a couple who is soon to be married. All in all, it was a good book, but suggested for couples who are engaged (in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Letters to Karen. It is a book I will look to and read over and over again. Though I am not old enough to begin thinking about marriage, this book helped me to know what I need and want in my future husband. This book will also help me in preparing to be the best wife I can be and I know that I will read chapters over. This book was very informative and helpful for marriages. Marriage is tough, but it can and will work if the couple is willing to talk about things and look to God. God can help and guide those who seek Him."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I think this book is excellent, its a real encouagement and good help for a godly marriage. It gives real live examples of married couples and there struggles. I am only 18 years old and have no plans to get married any time soon but I sometimes worry about what problems I am going to face. In reading this book I have been encouraged and assured that in a marriage you can work things out. I also have learned that as a woman of God I need to be a servant to my future husband and love him through every decision he makes no matter if I agree or disagree. I also learned a little bit more from the boys perspective and have become more understanding of them. I really like the fact that this story is about a father writing letters to his daughter. It's good for girls to get godly advice from the men in there lives. Especially there fathers. This book has changed my outlook on marriage. After reading it I am excited for the time in my life when I will experience marriage. That is, if God allows it, which I hope he does. It would be awesome to have the intimate love that comes from a marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I found that the book, Letters to Karen, was very helpful. It gave a perspective from the males point of view that might not have been known to women going into marriage otherwise. It also put men and women both in their place in a delicate way. This book shows how we are to go at marriage the right and Godly way. One key part of the book I thought was communication. Communication plays the role of 70% of a relationship making it very important to be able to do this in a relationship. This part, as well as the rest of the book, proved to be useful and practical. Another part that really stood out to me was the part that talked about chivalry. How it is still important to open doors and things of that sort after many years of marriage. Also, on the woman's behalf, to do special things for her spouse every once in a while. Letters to Karen also contained tips on how to be a pleasing wife and how we need to be submissive to our husbands. It also talked about numerous things from communication to spousal differences to sex to keeping God the focal point of your relationship. Because this book was written from a father to his daughter he was able to give all this beneficial advice from experience too. I enjoyed that the book included real life examples, it gives you a better idea of what to do should those identical problems arise. All in all it was an informaitve guide with a plephora of wisdom."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Are you in the beginning stages of getting married or even engaged? Well if so, this book might just be for you. Some who read &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; say it is a little too old fashioned for them, but call me old fashioned because I happen to like it. In his book, Dr. Charles Shedd explains to his daughter in letters before she is married tips and hints that will ensure her a successful marriage for the future. I don't believe Dr. Shedd's ideas are wrong, it's just that in many ways they have been forgotten. I enjoyed his book because in a world like today that has eliminated all moral standards, I was able to find encouragement and hope that someone still believes in the same beliefs as I do. I am grateful for that, and if you are searching for ways to better equip yourself for marriage, then buy this book right now and read it. It will present you with successful guidelines to help in your future marriage. I believe with the knowledge Dr. Shedd has shared with me through his book, that I will definitely be a better wife to my husband and I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"&quot;Letters to Karen&quot; is a compilation of letters from a father, Charlie Shedd, to his engaged daughter Karen. Shedd wrote these letters to assist Karen in being the best wife she could be. Overall, the book was very informative and dealt with a variety of subjects from communication to housekeeping. Each letter is a subject in itself. Shedd does not just scratch the surface either, he digs down deep and offers the truth to a loving and successful marriage. The chapter I found to be the most helpful was entitled &quot;Eyeball-to-Eyeball&quot;. In this letter Shedd focuses on what he calls &quot;The seven official rules to a good, clean fight&quot;. The points he makes, such as lower voices instead of raising them and never quarrel in public, make so much sense and can really help when trouble arises. I am currently in a dating relationship and have actually been able to apply many of the concepts from this book. I can see the awesome affect this book could have in a marriage situation. The ideas presented by Shedd are not out of date even though he wrote this in 1965. They are coming from a happily married man who has had much experience in marriage counseling. I would recommend this book to any woman who is in a relationship or will be at some time in her life. But don't just read it... apply it."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"What a good book! I cannot say how much this book filled my spirit with God's love and direction. I am young, not even close to marriage, but reading this book helped me to understand relationships better so that I will be prepared when I meet that man God has saved for me. My father loves me very much, just as Charlie Shedd loves Karen, so when I read this book I felt as though my father was talking to me. Shedd is a wonderful author and knows very much about relationships and gives so much insight to those in a serious relationship for both man and woman. I especially liked the chapter &quot;Emphasis on the Good Things&quot;. It was so wonderful how the couple he spoke of were so radiantly in love after such a rocky start. Their list of virtues of each other made such a difference in the happiness of their marriage; it was so inspiring. Also, in the Chapter &quot;The 'H' Twins- Humility and Honesty&quot;, I found it very uplifting to read the phrase- &quot;Blessed are the couples who are humble and honest, for they will reach a higher love!&quot; Also in this chapter it speaks of two things that will not reach the household of humble and honest souls- gossip and nagging. I think it is very important in a marriage that these two things are kept out. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and will definetly read it again when I am egaged!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"This book is incredibly insightful, and was well worth my time. In the way it is written (the context of a father to his daughter) helps me to relate closely to his messages. Because I have not quite reached the age where I would be considering marriage, I apply these truths about males (the explanations for their actions, behaviors, and thoughts) to the guys in my life at this time: my brothers, my dad, etc. Because women obviously differ from men in many aspects, namely their thought process and interpretations of life, it is very useful to get a guy's personal perspective, which is a dominant strength of this book. I was impressed by the father's abilities to portray the picture of a righteous, God-honoring marriage in a way that makes it seem feasible for any who work at it. It was encouraging to read examples from his own marriage where he and his wife had overcome major obstacles and had worked through instances in which their personalities clashed drastically, which might have ended up in heartache, had they not sought God's counsel. The marital advice given is priceless, and I will definitely keep this book to look back on and refer to throughout my life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a compilation of letters that a father wrote to his daughter who was about to be married. Shedd gives advice on how to make a marriage work, along with tips on how to be a pleasing wife. Some of the issues that he discusses are the importance of communication, chivalry, sex, spousal differences, and keeping God at the center of one's marriage. Shedd has counseled many couples in the past and draws his words of wisdom from his own personal experiences and from what he has learned from others. As a husband, he is able to tell his daughter what a man needs and desires from his wife. The book is an especially helpful source to anyone who is getting married or considering marriage in the future. However, I believe that this book will benefit any reader, whether single, engaged, married, etc. I found the chapters on communication to be the most applicable because communication is essential in any relationship. The book addresses many issues and areas of marriage and provides sound advice to the reader that will definitely allow for a happy and successful marriage that will last a lifetime. Some of the topics discussed were difficult for me to relate to, but that is most likely due to the fact that I am no where near ready to start considering marriage. The only negative comment that I have about this book is that it was a little slow-moving at times. Other than that, I found Letters to Karen to be informative and beneficial. I would definitely consider reading this book again when I am thinking about marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I gave &quot;Letters To Karen&quot; five stars because I found it to be full of interesting information. Even though the book was written in 1965 I did not find it to be as old fashioned as I thought it would be. Shedd gives good ideas on how to keep your marriage going smoothly. For instance: Shedd talked about giving your spouse some space when he or she needs it. I liked the chapter &quot;A Savory Smell From The Kitchen&quot; and how it talked about all the things you could do to make your meals more enjoyable. I thought it was clever how the list went from A-Z in ideas. There was a story that Shedd told in this book that was good if you are having a lot of troubles in your marriage. This couple was having surrmountable problems and were considering divorce when they got an idea. They wrote out all the things they did not like about each other, let the other person read the list, and then they burnt the bad lists. Then they made a list of all the good things they liked about each other, framed the lists, and hung them above their bed. That way they could look at those lists every day and remember the good things they liked about their spouse. I thought that was a wonderful idea. I also admired the way Shedd was able to openly and honestly talk about sex with Karen. I think some dads would have a hard time even thinking that one day their little girl will grow up, get married, and have sex. So, I appreciated his truthfulness. In one chapter it talks about how you should act like you were still courting in marriage. Shedd used the example of husbands opening the car door for their wife. Just little things like that to show you still care. I am very pleased I was able to read this book. I enjoyed it very much, especially because Shedd based a good marriage on having a firm relationship with God. With God anything's possible."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"I found this book's Chinese version in China. It's really amazing how good and practical this book is! I wish that I would have read it 2 years ago, then I could be a better wife. :-) But anyway... thanks to Charlei. It's never too late to read this book and practice it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Overall, the book was well written, well put together, and the chapters flow well together. The father was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what to say about a topic and when to say it. He had some interesting and funny stories to tell also, which were probably my favorite part of reading the book. He was probably a very good counselor, and after reading this book I probably would want to go to him with my marital problems. While I was reading it, I felt like I was learning a lot about something I have not really ever understood, the world of marriage. Obviously, being 17, I am not married and most likely will not be for a long time. But some people get married right out of college, and I feel it is important to be prepared for whatever comes your way, and this book does a good job of that. The reason only give this book a 3 after saying such good things about it, was that he repeated himself over and over. I also found him droning about something that happened to Karen in the past that seemed to have no relevance to me. Also, the chapters that were on sex were a little risqu&eacute;. Talking about chastity and the importance of sex in marriage and abstinence before marriage is one thing, but describing ways to have sex and talking about not being afraid made me a little uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Charlie Shedd's book Letter's to Karen is a very well written book. The insight's he gave on keeping a relationship strong were very good. I would highly recommend this book for any woman entering a relationship, especially one that could possibly lead to marriage. Throughout the book Charlie Shedd often refers to his personal experience in his own marriage or things that he has dealt with counseling other couples. The fact that Shedd has had so much experience helps to convince the reader that what he is saying is true. Another thing I like about Letters to Karen is that every time Shedd is bringing up a new point he will give an example of what will not work. And then he will tell a cute little story of what one wife does in her marriage to keep that problem from happening. Throughout the book there are certain points that Shedd continues to repeat, he does this on purpose and even tells the reader he only repeats these things because it is very important. Shedd has been happily married for a very long time. He know the things that can keep a marriage good, even in the rough times. His advice is realistic, any woman willing to try to keep her relationship alive and full of love could do the things that he mentions in this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"This is an old classic book of advice for a woman before marriage.

Why read books like this? It offers principles and perspective that will make your marriage and relationships better.

However, I think the author needs to learn something about women and their needs before he goes off on how we should basically worship men. He kept making reference to 'boosting their egos.' What about the women? We need ego-boosting every once in a while, too, you know!Also, he made it seem like women just plain talk too much. I do agree with that --to a certain extent. However, there also needs to be some agreement and LISTENING going on from the male's side of things. Some men are just so insensitive, they don't listen at all!Dr. Shedd did add some interesting stories during many of his letters, and most were helpful in either deciphering what he was meaning to say or just in getting a point across to the reader.Lastly, this book kind of warded me away from marriage . . . even more. It made it all seem so complicated (as I'm sure it probably is), but it scared me into thinking, 'I never want to get married! There's too much stuff to remember!' However, this book may be a bit old-fashioned in parts, but it does give good advice for marriage, and does, in fact, explain how to 'keep love in marriage.' The good part was that Dr. Shedd gave many helpful hints throughout the book. Now, the trick is to remember them all when --and if --I get married!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Wow! That was an awesome book!! I can hardly put it down after I start reading. There are so many statements in that book. In the book, he hit the most important points in marriage and how to keep it fresh. Even though it is a pretty old book, but a lot of his opinions can still apply in today's world. There are so many married couples in today's society forgot the basic skills to keep a interesting marriage. How to communicate, how to comproimse, how to think about others, and how love. I espically like the chapter &quot;Tell him he is wonderful&quot;. It tells that we should constantly tell our partner how wonderful he is and how much we appricate to have him by our side. We all humans and we like to know how much others feel about having us in their lives. To show apprication not only helps in married relationships but in friendships as well. Personally, I am an international student who studying overboared in the United States. I often receive letters from family and friends. I know I will be really moved if I got the same kind of letters from my family. Just like Houston Post said:&quot; Letters that any father would like to have written and any daughter would wish to have received.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably a female as this deals with marriage from a womans point of view."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"This book is a great book for someone who truly wants to go at marriage the right way, but for those who aren't to serious about marriage they probably will not heed much of what is said in this book. I like the way Shedd sort of put the women in her place and the man in his place. Not that he said the women should be barefoot and pregnant and the kitchen, and the men should work all day, come home, eat, and go to bed. But how the women should do chores, cook, stroke the man's ego, etc. They are things a women knows she ought to do, but feel in this day and age they need to be more masculine. The &quot;Bridge of Communication&quot; chapter I believe was the best it made me open up more to people close around me. I've always been one to close up and to not let anybody know why I'm feeling the way I do. But when reading this chapter it was like a reality check. Communication plays 70% a role in every relatonship. It is such an important part of marriage. My whole life I've never really wanted to get married because I just figured they would all end up in divorce sooner or later. But after reading this book, it gives me some hope that there is some men out there that do believe like this book, and will stay married to one person HAPPILY there entire life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"this book gives great advice to those who are engaged or wish to get married. this book is about a loving father that gives useful advice to his daughter who is about to get married. this book taught me about different problems that come up when in a relationship and how to deal with them. i think that karen is very fortunate to have such a loving father that is willing to give advice along with personal situations that he found himself in. karens father has a great relationship with his daughter because he tells her whatever is on his mind. when i become a parent i will do my best to have a good relationship with my children just as karen's father was to her. i would recommend this book because people can learn alot about marraige though the letters of karen's father."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen : on keeping love in marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was a great book.

With a villain right out of a James Bond movie and an excellent supporting cast (but why did my favorite character have to die?), Reasoner keeps the pace at breakneck speed from beginning to end. My first impulse after reading this fine novel was to flip on the TV and wait for another Walker, Texas Ranger adventure."},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"Despite the nitpickings of some readers I found Hell's Half Acre to be the best of the Walker, Texas Ranger novels so far. A story worthy of a teleplay (and why isn't Mr. Reasoner on tap to write an episode?) with all the little touches that bring out the characters to the fans while not confusing new readers with meaningless trivia. The way Reasoner handles the storyline involving Ranger Cooper shows his knowledge of the old west and Fort Worth in particular. For those readers who enjoyed the Cooper sections and good old fashioned westerns I heartliy recommend the authors Judge Earl Stark series."},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"I bought the book for my 12 year old daughter...who's a BIG Walker fan...and she says it's a good book."},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"The second book in the &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; series featured a very good present-day story, strongly paralleled by an equally riveting 1901 &quot;Hayes Cooper&quot; story.As with the first book, however, Mr. Reasoner continues to refer to C. D. Parker's business as &quot;C. D.'s Place&quot;; it's &quot;C.

This book is an inspiration for all. A book to be had in anyones own personal library of favorites. Perfect for sitting down and reading in front of a fire. You may be skeptical at first about this book from other reviewers saying that it isn't worth the money, but you shouldn't believe them. They are just people who don't understand literature like this filled with metaphors and secret meanings that aren't obvious through the first read-through. Literally every word is action-packed in this book whether the word is 'roundhouse' or 'and'. Go Chuck Norris go!"},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"While the plot of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger: The Novel&quot; is good, it seems that Mr. Reasoner would do well to watch the show a little more closeley. For example: 1)C. D. owns &quot;C. D.'s Bar &amp; Grill&quot;, not &quot;C. D.'s Place&quot;; 2)Past episodes have shown that Ranger Trivette has GREAT DIFFICULTY in riding a horse (an admirable acting job by Clarence Gilyard, whose biography indicates rodeo experience); 3)Likewise, Trivette had to learn to drive an 18-wheeler in one episode; and 4)Ranger Walker talks less on the show than he does in the book.These are some of the things that caught my attention. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the book, and I hope Mr. Reasoner writes another one soon. (I'd just like to see things a little closer to the show's portrayals.)"},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"After reading a section of this book at a time it reminds you of the TV show Walker Texas Ranger. This book is like a text-version of the TV Show.GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Walker Texas Ranger: The Novel","review":"A fairly non-descript tie-in for Norris' morality/martial arts-lite tv vechicle. There is a great character submerged here, i.e Lone Wolf Gonzales upon whom the earlier incarnation of Walker was derived, but, heartbreakingly, here, in Reasoners novel as with the tv show, the grittiness and any much needed depth is absent. Perfuctionary stuff as it is, Walker is a difficult figure not to warm to, as this book demonstrates, but one gets to feel almost as frustrated as the real life Texas ranger may have, in the sense that his true colours and abilities, and ironically, those of Norris' are being diluted, understandably, for mass appeal. Walker needs to get down and dirty to make the character breathe, and unfortunately this offering barely touches the surface. Still, if Walker does it for you, great, but, for this reader and viewer Norris' original take on this theme, JJ McQuade holds far more creditable dimension and weight."},{"Title":"Ashes to Ashes","review":"The cardinal has made the decision to close St. Bernadette's Parochial School. They can't find enough teachers, enrollment is down, and costs are up. They have an offer to purchase from a real estate developer, and the church can't afford to turn it down.However, the parents in the neighborhood are not ready to let the school close its doors without a fight. They organize a Parents League and file a lawsuit. Negotiations begin, but neither side is willing to give in. The Sloan Guarantee Trust is handling the multimillion mortgage, so John Putnam Thatcher is stuck in the discussions. Things are at a stalemate, when the president in the league - and the accusing party in the lawsuit - is found murdered in the church.Soon things are really out of control. Protesters flock to the little neighborhood, tempers flare, and the violence mounts. Thatcher better figure out what's going on before riots start breaking out.I was so excited to find this one at the used bookstore. I totally love this series, and even though there are lots of little ways in which this books gives away its age (references to the Dow Jones losing a whopping 30 points in one day!), the conflicts are still real. And although each book opens with a few paragraphs about Wall Street, it doesn't take an economist to appreciate these little gems.

You must become another man.'The width and scope of the subject is enormous; I hope there will be more of similar thorough studies made in the future. It is about the brothers and sisters outside the monastic life, the lay people, living in the spirit of oral teachings and studies of the Desert Fathers.

Wuthnow sees the most significant change as being a decline in the denominational divisions that were once so important in American religious life, and their replacement by a huge chasm between liberal and conservative religious sensibilities, a division Wuthnow points out often cuts as much through denominations as separates them. Perhaps his most important contribution is his effort to place this restructuring in the context of larger trends in American society, notably the divisive politics and cultural innovation of the sixties, the changing role of women and the trememdous expansion of higher education that occurred after World War II. He also notes a degree of continuity between the conservative versus liberal division and the early twentieth-century fundamentalist-modernist conflict within American religion. He is careful, though, to explain and contextualize the greater success the evangelical Christian movement has had in building a movement and mobilizing followers than did the earlier and in many ways similar fundamentalist camp. Perhaps one's only caveat here might be that the book raises many questions it does not fully address about the extent to which American culture is becoming genuinely secular, if it is doing so. Written at a high level of generality, the book also leaves one wondering about how the division of religious life into polarized camps of liberalism and conservativism affects the subjective spiritual experience of Americans. In brief, this book is a major and analytical treatment of a topic that remains very germane to how Americans now live and worship; those desiring to understand how American religion got where it is today should read it."},{"Title":"The Restructuring of American Religion","review":"Wuthnow is clearly of the conviction that American religion has undergone a serious change since WWII. At the end of WWII, Wuthnow believes common assumptions about religion existed. First, it was Biblically-based, congregational, but with indivdualistic tendencies. 2 out of 3 persons attended a church once a month or more, and 42% attended every week. \\"Protestant, Catholic, or Jew\\" was the main question.After WWII, the dominant mode of religious institutions interacting with the larger society was to instruct and inspire individuals. A comcommittent focus on ethics, social justice as part of the larger sense of declaring Christian principles. A spirit of public evangelism and private education held sway, not the least as an indirect demonstration of political muscles. As education became increasingly common and with it the growth of the state, religious institutions adapted by forming and expanding educational curricula of their own. The emphasis on education was given two emphases. From the conservative side beliefs and the process of arriving at those beliefs became a standard for the articulation of genuine values. Liberals in turn tended toward not the content of beliefs, but rather a procedural validation of the process of coming to a set of beliefs. In the 1950's, these divisions began forming, even as all kinds of denominations exploded in growth.According to Wuthnow, perhaps one of the most important developments in 20th century American religious life has been the development of special purpose groups. These groups grew from a few dozen after the Civil War to about 150 at the turn of the century. Since from 1960 to the 1980's, about 300 were formed, bringing the post-WWII total to around 500. This is not remarkable when compared with other nonprofit and voluntary associations, many of which have grown more than religious ones. But in comparsison with religious denominations, it has been spectacular growth overall. General levels of affluence and leisure time have provided the fuel for growth. Wuthnow argues though, that both directly and indirectly, the State is the biggest factor in the growth of such associations, as different groups seek to encourage, restrain, or influence particular aspects of civil policy and state growth.At the same time, Wuthnow also draws attention to the disillusionment in government brought through the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the Roe vs. Wade decision. He argues that the subsequent rise and popularity of morality as a public issue and its intimate connection to government and policy helped legitimate the rise of the political evangelicals, even as the denominational hierarchies were increasingly dominated by theological liberals. Conservative evangelicals took advantage and built the public terms of a debate in which their morals and values were assumed to be part of the national spotlight and the national debate, while arguing that in the field of morality liberals were either absent altogether or illmoral in some way, rather than just different in their views.This is a major work in the sociology of religion, even as its language is a bit outdated and at times, very parochial and condescending towards the new religious movements of the 1950's and 1960's. Overall though, it is required reading (coupled with Robert Ellwood, and Robert Fuller) and on the development of 20the century religion in the U.S. Wuthnow does try to place almost all the impetus for change on the State, (and the New Deal philosophy) but tends to overly downplay to what extent Americans demanded changes in race, gender, immigration, and military policy on their own first."},{"Title":"Perfect 10: Writing and Producing the 10-Minute Play","review":"Most how-to-write guides are completely worthless. Once you've learned your grammar and have the concepts of conflict and resolution mastered, the writer's ard lapses into something some people can do and some people can't, and no one really knows why. I keep buying how-to-write books, like this one by Gary Garrison, hoping one will eventually deliver more.Well, this one delivers. By assuming the reader has already tried at least some writing, the paradigm shifts from simple instruction to specific points that green writers often need fine-tuned. Garrison seems more like a copy editor at times, making suggestions for clarity and story efficiency, than a mere how-to writer.The book is slim, little more than a pamphlet, and the conversational tone sometimes comes across as flippant, so not everyone will enjoy working with it. Also, there's only about so much you can learn from reading a book; if you expect your work to be magically transformed by Garrison's charisma and ability, you're in for a sore disappointment.However, this book is more useful than not. The two most useful chapters are Five and Seven. In Chapter Five, Garrison interviews experienced ten-minute play producers, who make some actual nuts-and-bolts suggestions to improve the average young playwright's style. In Seven, Garrison reprints five whole ten-minute plays and asks astute study questions about them.This book is no magic bullet. Writing remains hard work, and plenty of it. However, for a new writer looking to expand skill and depth in writing, this book helps you avoid the pitfalls that beleaguer those who insist on going it alone."},{"Title":"Perfect 10: Writing and Producing the 10-Minute Play","review":"I was very pleased with the way this book was written and organized. As a fledgling author of ten minute plays, I found Mr. Garrison's book to be very helpful, witty and professionally done. His experience as director of ten minute play festivals is invaluable to anyone planning on doing the same. As a member of a community theater looking to include ten minute plays in their repetoire over the next few years, Mr. Garrison's book has given me a good idea of what I'm in for. Well worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Perfect 10: Writing and Producing the 10-Minute Play","review":"I have used this book with my beginning playwriting students for several years now.

I should admit - I have copied those hints into my working note-book and have already started using them. But as for the rest of the book (i.e. chapters on \\"producing\\") I would say it is the useless waiste of paper, more like if-you-are-idiot-I-can-help-you style text, full of primitive statements - absoluetaly nothing new, original. Endless and boring pages on how the play can be better sold to a theater. With one exeption - there are several plays of different authors written specially for this book, kind of demonstration of what Mr Garrison meant to say. Though, they can really teach you something, and namely, how NOT to write.On the whole, the book seemed still useful for me (thanks to those chapters on sturcture) and I rate it with 3 stars."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Own Working Robot Pet","review":"I don't remember WHY I decided to buy this book, but I'm glad I did. It's one of my favorite robot books. I learned alot about setting up a microprocessor to read and write to RAM, external addressing, and lots of other cool stuff. The project is just so neat, that I'm considering hunting down an 8085 just so that I can build the little robot pet. It responds to voice commands, randomly does &quot;pet&quot; things, and plays on it's own. How cute. It even hunts down it's own charger, acts hungry if it can't find it... ! If you're interested in real microprocessors (not a basic stamp) get this book. You'll learn alot from it."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Own Working Robot Pet","review":"I originally purchased this book many years ago to construct the robot it describes. I am presently 'resurecting' the project for my children and have come to appreciate this book more with each reading. DaCosta created a readable and practical 'how to' manual on contructing a very ingenious little robot. Unfortunately, the technology described is no longer cutting edge (the robot uses the now obsolete Intel 8085A microprocessor). However, this book is still a great primer for first time microprocessor users. I don't know if DaCosta ever updated the book, but if he did, and I could find it, I would buy it without hesitation."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Own Working Robot Pet","review":"This book starts with the notion of a robot pet and finishes after having developed a fully working prototype. To be sure the computer technology has dated. *BUT* the exploration of each problem and the thorough discussion of various practical solutions was always intended to enable experimenters to roll their own hardware and software implementations anyway. DaCosta always provides one good solution for each problem. Some info is priceless, particularly soniscan, the object avoidance system; Excom,a way of 'talking' to the robot; and Audigen, providing the pet with a way of communicating with the owner or growling at intruders. The description of the ARASEM (ARtifically RAndom SElf-Motivation) software architecture is a classic. If you are interested in the concept of emulating domestic pet behaviour by building a robot, you will not do any better than this book."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Own Working Robot Pet","review":"The first time I read this book was in Junior High School. I was quite the bookworm and spent time digging up this volume repeatedly from an obscure section at the back. This book inspired me to get into robotics and automation, after taking up a curiosity in electronics thanks to those kits from Radio shack.Packed with useful information and clear instructions, this is definitely a book for those looking to get into microprocessors with more power than a Basic STAMP. While the technology is dated, and I mean dated as it's hard enough to find the Intel 8085A Processor without an internet search, it's still inspires ideas on how to apply the super simple circiutry to animatronics project I have in mind.The book is straight forward and feels quite open ended, this is good because even the author encourages you to experiment. The project in the book is only a stepping stone to what you can do with it! So if you want to toy with idea of building a robot but haven't got a clue, this book is for you!Don't have the soldering skills? Don't worry, the wire-wrapping method keeps you free of dangerous Lead fumes, your fingers free of hot irons and bad burns. Also, if you make a mistake you don't have to desolder, which is more complicated than soldering in the first place. Included is a diagram on how to wire wrap so you don't have an excuse not to try.

For this book to be useful, or to enjoy this book, one should already be very familiar with the subject.Perhaps the book could be useful for reference purposes since it does contain a lot of information. Because everything is so densely packed and not very clearly presented, I found it not useful for a first acquantaince with the subject. And certainly not for beginners.

I personally found this book to be an invaluable reference while walking the pilgrimage route. However, I recognize how other individuals might differ in their assessment.First and foremost, it is essential to recognize what this book is NOT designed to do.The handbook is not a trail guide.It does not list refuges or explain where to camp.It does not tell you where to eat or what to pack.If this is what you are looking for, find another book.With that said and done, the handbook did provide me with an extremely valuable reference in establishing a cultural context for the sites that I was visiting. I am not an expert in Romanesque architecture, nor do I know the lives of Roman Catholic saints well enough to recognize the major figures in a Retablo. I never had the opportunity to extensively study the history of the pilgrimage. Left to my own devices, I would most certainly never have read much in the way of medieval Spanish poetry. In all honesty, even after walking the pilgrimage route, I am still far from expert in all of these areas. However, the handbook did provide me with enough information that I was able to appreciate much more of the sites that I was visiting.As other individuals have noted, time for sightseeing is often short. I found the handbook to be extremely useful in prioritizing my time and determining which sites would be most interesting to visit. As an example, none of the other sources that I consulted noted the existence of the Blacksmith forge at Compludo which may very well have been my favorite part of the trip. Without the handbook, I would have never have visted half the church nor understood a quarter of what I was seeing.As I noted at the start of this posting, when it comes to the handbook, your mileage may vary. Each person has their own reason for traveling the Camino. If you aren't interested in cultural history or architectural reference, you might find it more useful to bring another reference. However, if you are interested in understanding the \\"why\\" behind what you're seeing, I think that you will find this reference as valuable as I did."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook","review":"David Gitlitz and Linda Davidson have written a remarkable cultural handbook on the Road to Santiago.

Having lived in many of the places along the road, I've been critical of many of the books I've read as too heavy on the &quot;Big C&quot; culture: That which isn't really culture at all...just the obvious stereotype. This book is heavy on the &quot;Little C&quot; culture, as a book which delves into little-known asides which inspire the traveler to seek and find, and create a unique memory for themselves.It offers a variety of insights on history, lore, architecture, terrain, and other &quot;bonuses&quot;.

Everynight before I went to sleep, I would read the passage about the day I had just walked, and then would read the passage about the next day's walk. I saw and experienced things I would have totally missed if I did not have this book. I would walk along and think of the millions of pilgrams that had walked this path for over 1000 years. In this books there are excerpts from journals of medieval pilgrams, which really made me feel the history of this pilgramage. I too worried about the weight of the book, but found that in the long run it was really worth the added pound in my backpack. I do recommend taking a more practical guidebook as well. I found the guidebook put out by the Confraternity of St. James to be great! If you are not one bit interested in the History and Folklore of the Camino, then skip this book.

Much of the content of &quot;The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago&quot; was touched upon during the lecture: the religious background, various myths and legends, stories from the rural villages along the road, and the spiritual experience involved.One of my favourite moments was when Davidson asked, &quot;What is a pilgrimage?&quot; The audience was composed of various nationalities, religions and ethnic groups, but we all had ideas to offer. The third or fourth brave soul said that a pilgrimage was a religious experience. She continued her explanation and we arrived at the definition of a pilgrimage as a journey that takes one away from comforts and friends, a journey of self-discovery, and one that must be made on foot.She mentioned other secular pilgrimages: Graceland, the Alamo, and on a more sombre note, the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and the former site of the World Trade Centre in New York City. A pilgrimage can extend to finding a deeper meaning in life, not necessarily of a religious nature, a pilgrimage as a voyage of discovery.I was fortunate to attend Linda Kay Davidson's seminar; I learned a great deal about pilgrimages in general and Santiago de Compostela, about the history of the region, the terrain, the rural towns and friendly townsfolk, cloistered nuns who had not seen the next village over and would never do so except by postcard, the architecture, from gothic to baroque, the sometimes humorous stories of saints' lives, the sombre roadside shrines for pilgrims who ultimately did not finish their journey.This is an excellent guide to Santiago de Compostela whether you are merely interested in reading more about the region or if you are planning a pilgrimage yourself. And if you have the chance to see Linda Kay Davidson in person, do so. She makes the journey a memorable one, taking time at the end of the seminar to show a brief slideshow with a medieval soundtrack and had us mentally create (or recreate) a pilgrimage of our own to Compostela.

Both examples ignore non-religious subjects-for example, the best of Navarre and Rioja wine growing country along the Camino and Logrono. Irache doesn't count. Gitlitz and Davidson DO NOT recommend or rate the local albergue, do NOT guide one to the restaurants, do not search the mystical solution behind your tired feet. The authors do describe the cultural background behind the settlements and the buildings which the pilgrim experiences and observes as he/she walks. They do indeed explain the myriad of church styles, the art, the architecture, the convoluted history and historical fiction encountered along the way. There is also a good sprinkling of folklore, short accounts of those saints met along the Camino, their lives, and other tall tales, and a good sense of humor as well. Definitely not a how too book-call it a why book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook","review":"Very in-depth to be of interest to most people.

First of all it is simply too heavy and bulky to lug around an entire country. Secondly it provides no information on refuges, routes, places to eat, etc. Thirdly the authors frequently recommend staying multiple days at the larger cities, which can be very hard for credencial-carrying pilgrims since most refuges have a one night maximum stay. If you are rich and can afford to rent a car, stay in hotels, and take a couple of months off from work, this is the guide to carry. If you want a more genuine experience I suggest leaving this book at home and picking up one of the many more useful guides upon arrival in Spain."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook","review":"The first time I walked the Camino I brought along a spare copy and tore pages out as I went along. This was not a good way to use an excellent guide which is really the only one of hundreds of Camino titles to cover historical monuments and the history of places you pass in depth. On my second Camino I carried an iPad and would gladly have purchased the Kindle edition had it been available. I'm delighted to see it come out as an ebook and recommend it to everyone walking the Camino who's carrying a device to read ebooks. Taken together with the smaller Brierley guide (hard copy) which still has the maps, it's all you'll need."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook","review":"I thought authors of The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago was a great guide/help but I also thought having a Camino memoir would also be a good idea to take too! I was right! While picking this book up I also got Elizabeth Sheehan's The Trail: A True Tale of the Camino. It was a great companion book and perhaps opened up the Camino as something more thoughtful and colorful in a way for me. It's set in her journey along the Camino. There was something about it that just stuck with me especially as it light-heartily showed me life through the eyes of someone seeking more with every step. It was definitely lovely to see this long journey through the Elizabeth's eyes.The Trail by Elizabeth Sheehan is also a lot like a walking meditation and it reminds me of all the questions I had when I was younger: Will we find the person we are meant to be with soon or much later? Is there \\"The one\\"? What am I meant to do or be? Do I have regrets? I suppose this is quite the existential tall order but these are the questions that drive us especially when walking the Camino and it was good to feel similar as I walked it two years ago. Certainly now that I am little older and more settled (I'm 34!) I find myself loving books like Elizabeth's because they bring me back to the adventure of THE SEARCH! If you have ever had any questions about what is next in your life, the personal journeys and bravery it takes to explore, or know of a person who is beginning or beginning again their own adventure into the big wide world then The Trail: A True Tale of the Camino is perfect! The Trail's wit and thoughtfulness catches me and reminds me of the power of words, their deep affect on us, and their ability to unearth those reminders that the adventure of life both allows us to fall and to soar. It's the adventure that exists in all of us today and that I encountered while reading The Trail. Bravo to the authors who wrote this guidebook, I would not have been inspired to also read Elizabeth's book too.Books beget books, I guess!The Trail: A True Tale of the Camino"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook","review":"This is the most scholarly book on the history of, and the cultural, architecture and geographic sites along the Camino that I have found. It's not a guide to finding food and lodging each day, but rather a guide to understand every landmark passed along the way and all the lore associated with the journey. Because of its size, I've hoped for years that this book would become available on Kindle so that it can accompany me when I finally do the walk.

At the airport in Santiago I gave that city's information (with the appendices) in the remaining shell of a book, to a couple that had befriended me along the way and had read many of the chapters.

It turned out to be a marvelous multi-faceted reference. Due to weight considerations, I left it at home, instead of schlepping it 800 KM across Spain. Then, outside of Burgo de Ranero, I see THIS BOOK, waiting for me on a roadside bench. &quot;That's my book!&quot;, I exclaim. Needless to say, it traveled with me the rest of the way to Santiago.

I met many adventurous souls on the Camino, but none who would think to follow the bloated itinerary suggested by these authors. Apart from the lack of maps or accomodation information, some of their trail tips were so off base (i.e. suggestions for scenic detours that wound through industrial land) that I wonder if they even hiked the same path! There are much better guide books out there, but they are not readily available in this country. My suggestion is to wait and buy The Practical Pilgrim's Guide, relatively easy to find in Europe and available in several different languages. I picked up a copy midway through the Camino. While it is much thinner on the cultural and historical details (and thus easier to carry), all points of significant interest are treated with just enough detail, not the kind of overkill that Glitz and Davidson's book doles out. I dumped their book on the side of the road after it gave me its only practical use, as I had run out of toilet paper."},{"Title":"The Jekyll Island cookbook: A seasonal collection of fine foods, beautiful flowers & delicious gifts","review":"I love the Cream Cheese Pound Cake!!!

Larson's book is good if you are a newbie to RS, but the examples he uses are very minimal.How to Choose:1. If you're a solid SQL Server user and are comfortable setting up RS and have a little C# or VB.NET experience; go with this book.2. If you're moderately clueless but really want to learn; use Larson's book \\"Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services,\\" {and maybe pick-up Murach's C# (.Net Developer)}You may have to do what I did and go through both RS books. I started out clueless and the WROX book would have been too much to start with. Larson's book was a good starter for me, \\"an advanced newbie\\" but left me wanting much more.This review will eventually be out of date, but I think I'll stand by the WROX book (though it has errors). Larson's book is going to get beat out as the entry level book pretty quickly. (as soon as someone publishes another one)WARNING: If you have never installed SQL Server, this is not the place to start. Reporting Services is not Word. It takes a moderate level of Server knowledge to even get started."},{"Title":"Professional SQL ServerReporting Services","review":"I have looked over a number of books about SQL Server Reporting Services (RS), and after comparing them decided that this one is best for my needs.The book starts with a clear overview of just what RS is, what its components are, and how they work together. This seems to be the part that many other books just miss. Other books seem to get caught up in the hype but fail to deliver a direct, no-frills or buzzwords, account of the actual architecture.I also like that the books assumes that the reader already knows SQL, .NET programming (although you don't have to be a professional to understand their examples), and SQL Server. This enables them to avoid repeating material which is better covered on other books, and allows them to focus on explaining just what Reporting Services can do, and lets the reader get started using RS right away.My one beef is that their code examples are in both VB.NET and C#, which takes up unnecessary space in the text. But that's a minor complaint when they otherwise do a great job explaining this fascinating and powerful product."},{"Title":"Professional SQL ServerReporting Services","review":"This book is not only a great introduction to Reporting Services, but has increased my knowledge of both XML and the .NET data access technologies.

If you are thinking about moving from Crystal to Reporting Services, I would recommend adding this book to your library."},{"Title":"Professional SQL ServerReporting Services","review":"With any SQL Server database, once you've populated it and it has undergone real events (esp. transactions), then you'll need to summarise and display the results. Most likely, on a periodic basis. Plus, the report might be for a nontechnical audience. (Your boss?) So the book offers an efficient investment of your time. It shows straightforward ways to get at the data and how to present it.While the authors try to minimise it, there is still a modicum of coding. They provide example snippets in C# and VB.NET. If you're already familiar with either language, then there will be nothing complicated in the code for you.The book also demonstrates how Microsoft is migrating .NET into a seamless integration with its flagship database.The book is suitable for an intermediate level programmer in C# or VB.NET. It also helps to have some experience in the visuals of laying out a report. For example, an HTML UI or PowerPoint background would not be amiss."},{"Title":"Professional SQL ServerReporting Services","review":"This book does an excellent, thorough job of introducing the product (which is awesome!), and then going all the way through to advanced coding & custom manipulation.

In fact I don't know what would be the book for you. I'm still looking."},{"Title":"Professional SQL ServerReporting Services","review":"The architecture overviews are good, but from there on it's full of errors and lacking the detail needed to make it useful. It has what you could loosely call &quot;excercises&quot; that I've gone through (step-by-step) and found many errors with. Errors that require many hours of debugging and fixing on the part of the reader. The writing is very cursory, overly broad and not detailed enough to be useful. The book often mentions that something useful CAN be done with Report Services but doesn't explain HOW to do it. Perhaps a revised edition is in order.

It does have a few simple excersises but thats about it. For example on pages 80-81 of the book in the grooping section it reads: &quot;Tabular or matrix data may be sorted and grouped on one or multiple levels&quot; then there is a nice screen shot of grouped design, it does not tell you how to do it. Then a few paragraphs later after the another screen shot it reads: &quot;In this design for this report, there are four list controls placed inside one another. Grouping have been created for each of the lists to organize them into hierarchy&quot; It says nothing about designing such a thing. Basically the book lacks hands on excersises.

There was \\"Cold Wars,\\" the \\"No Limits\\" anthology and the previous hardcover, \\"Stone and Anvil.\\" At first, I would complain that there isn't a need for another hardcover considering the last few books have been at a special higher price than your standard paperback. Then, after reading it, I see why. \\"After the Fall\\" is a new approach to the series. My main complaint about the last slew of NF books has been that it's gone from a believable Trek series with a bit more of a laid back, honest type of humor to being like a fan-fiction running wild. This book seems to return to New Frontier's roots. It's more like a book from the \\"Dark Allies\\" days than the more recent ones.First, a bit of negative criticism. Having read all the books with the exception of \\"No Limits\\" and the short story in the Gateways finale, I sort of missed the big story Peter David chose to gloss over. In my opinion, that should have been the focus of a book or series of books. Instead, this starts off like any Greek epic and puts you in the middle of trouble without much explanation. Some of the leading characters like Shelby and Soleta get their moments but they aren't really in the book much. Characters reflect on them and what's happened but still, these characters are left on the outskirts.The book is also hard to keep up with because there are so many characters in the story that some of the new ones aren't properly introduced, others (such as Selar) are only given a scene here or there, the whole Excalibur/Trident split leaves you wanting to get more of one or the other crew and there's an entirely new setting added, as if we didn't have enough to keep up with; New Thallon. Some characters such as Robin Lefler, Kat Mueller and the Trident's XO all get the spotlight put on them but how they reached this point in their lives is left to the readers to fill in the gaps with the little information provided. I would have also been interested to know how Jellico and Calhoun could have gotten beyond their big issues to become chummy friends. Or what exactly Soleta does in her new position.Now, the good. The jump does allow for interesting plot developments. I thought I'd be bored to tears at the start with the New Thallon and Si Cwan plot. After getting into it, David seems to have truly created an original plot that only he could have come up with. I like that Cwan and Lefler still have one another to bounce off. There was still that laid-back feel that makes the book easy to read. I was glad to see the return of some old faces from New Frontier's past and a new alien threat being created that sets this series off from one another. What I most liked is that this story and series seems more off on its own than in the past. There has been a reference to some other Trek series or episode in the past. Or some appearance by Picard or mentioning of a big event in Trek that's spawned this situation. This is all original and though David could have mentioned Nemesis, Voyager's return or many other situations, they're left out and the story and series seems stronger for it.I'd say this story is worth reading. I'm not sure if the book is worth this price. Though there is a dramatic change for the plot and many of these characters, and the juvenile-comic book tone is present in the beginning, there was a noticeable change towards the end of the book that made it seem as if it was getting more mature and leaving behind certain negative things. If you are a fan of Robin Lefler, Si Cwan and Kalinda, I'd say this book was written for you. The Excalibur and Calhoun don't appear to later on in the book and really don't have a large role until the last 100 or so pages. It's still a good read and I enjoyed it more so than I did \\"Stone and Anvil.\\" It leaves me wanting to know what's going to happen which is more than what the previous few books have left me with."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"If you have a friend who is a Star Trek fan and vision impaired then this is the book for them. This is a very good 150 page New Frontier novel; unfortunately they fit it onto 320 pages. It has all the characteristic fun, humor, and adventure you expect from Peter David. The words scream at you off the page, not solely because of the humor and wit but also because of their size. This is the largest font I've ever seen in a mainstream novel. In school I would sometimes get assignments where I had to turn in a 3 page assignment when I could only produce 2 pages. In these cases large fonts, creative line spacing, and other creative formatting techniques came in quite handy. My best efforts pale in comparison to what was done with this book. I salute the typesetter for their efforts. To the editor who made the decision to split one novel into two books I give the opposite of a salute, whatever that may be. For $25 I expect more than a novelette with delusions of grandeur. When the next New Frontier or Deep Space Nine book comes out I will wait for the soft cover or a used copy. My money and I deserve better than this sad effort."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"Once again, Peter David shows us why the New Frontier series is the best thing currently happening in the Star Trek universe.His latest entry in the saga of Captain Calhoun and the crew of the U.S.S. Excaliber picks up the story three years after the events of Stone and Anvil. A lot has changed in the New Frontier universe. Si Cwan is now an important leader in the New Thallonian Empire and married to Robin Lefler, Soleta has joined the Romulan Empire, Shelby is an admiral and Calhoun is, well, he's still Calhoun. From the beginning, the strength of the New Frontier has been the characters and the freedom David has to play with them. Moving the plot forward three years from the last installment means that David can put these strong characters into new situations, but still have readers identify with them. One of the compelling things about this novel is the desire to see how each character got from Stone and Anvil to the events chronicled here.And in this, David excels.But there's also one heck of a good plot. Xyon, Calhoun's son returns and wreaks havoc with Kalinda'a wedding day. This throws the New Thallonian empire and Ci Swan's marriage to Lefler into chaos. Meanwhile, a new mysterious alien race shows up with the ability to use transwarp conduits.For those of you expecting a complete novel, I will say this one ends on a cliffhanger and it's the first part of a new trilogy. But I didn't mind one bit. The story come to a good ending point--leaving you curious and wanting more. And you can bet I'll be the first in line for the next installment of this series later in 2005."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"Although filled with some interesting plots and characterizations I was disappointed by the \\"Naked Gun\\" type of story telling. I think every character has a \\"don't call me Shirley\\" moment and it is annoying to say the least. But, I am a huge fan of New Frontiers and anything is better than nothing. Indeed, the scene involving Calhoun in the council chamber is incredible (I'll say no more to avoid spoilage).My overall impression is that this novella was rushed out and doesn't represent the quality we have come to expect from Mr. David. Yet, even in this short, comic stretch it is good to see our New Frontier friends.A side note. The letter to the readers at the beginning was very strange. Essentially, Mr. David lectured the reader that these are his characters and he would do what he pleases with them. That is part of my basis for thinking this was not a novella that was ready for publication. Very strange."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"After what seemed like a very long wait, I eagerly sat down with this book and polished it off in 3.5 hours. The negatives: Hardcover price (midigated by Amazon). The \\"to be continued\\" (again, and having to wait another year for it) A negative tone (ie, Characters had almost all negative conversations and relationships, with no positive character development, I know conflict is central for good writting, but it would be nice to see the characters experience a little happiness now and again.)The Positives:With the jump forward, this book was able to put in a lot of events and developments to characters we have grown to love. Especially since the last book (Stone and Anvil) took place over less than a week, it was nice to see some life changes. Even with the expanding cast, most characters were fit in at least in cameo, and were mentioned more.There was typical David humor, and some really funny bits, a scene in the throne room literally had me laughing outloud, for awhile.Other thoughts:The publisher's review is a little misleading in places, but the story makes up for it. Unfortunately it also spoils some of the artificial suppense David created for the introduction of our characters in a new light. Many of the changes are left unexplained, but it seems that the information will be fleshed in eventually.I'd recommend this book, and the seris, at least for a read, even if you have to borrow it from the library until the paperback comes out as it is one that I'll be reread several times."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"Overall, I am truly a large fan of the New Frontier series, and am so glad that Peter David takes on all the writing chores as only he knows his own characters best, however, I felt 'After the Fall' was a little sub-standard to all previous attempts.I'd refer to this book as a 'filler prequel' to \\"Missing In Action\\", as the cliff hanger in this novel is a direct set up for the next installment. But that's what it felt like...300+ pages of setting up for what will hopefully be the real action as the next title implies.Oh, there was action here, but a little predictable and the we've seen the same 'Romeo & Juliet' scenario used so many times in the past, though to Mr. David's credit, he does put his signature spin on things as only he can do.Overall, there were some beginning plot points that were introduced, but I assume will only be dealt with in the next book as they didn't go far here. And neither did much action. Compared to previous New Frontier stories, Capt. Calhoun and crew tend to be much more maverick and swashbuckling in nature. It just wasn't here, except the brief and fun fight Calhoun and Kebron get involved planetside with opposing forces (no more spoilers).Missing was many of the signature in-depth character development we are used to in teh New Frontier series. There were hints and progression, but felt as if some holes still needed filling to catch the reader up to speed. That's what Mr. David is so usually good at....giving us a real fun and developing background on all the characters we love. It just seemed rushed here with little action.Hopefully 'Missing in Action' will result in the big Pay-Off, but I was slightly disapointed that not too much was terribly accomplished in 300+ pages we haven't seen before elsewhere."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"Peter david has done it again!

Thus, this is not a novel, but a novel fragment. For those who enjoy the \\"to be continued -- tune in next week, same time, same channel\\" tradition, this is certainly a five-star book. In fact, even for those who, like me, HATE that tradition, this book is very close to a five-star effort; at least he chooses a better break-point than he sometimes does, and the book is long enough to justifiably argue that the entire story couldn't fit under one cover. But it always seems to me to be a sign of an insecure author if he doesn't trust his story to be good enough to lure the reader back for the next installment without ending on a cliffhanger, and there WAS a break-point that would have given more of an impression of closure, even if it WAS a false impression. So in spite of truly enjoying the book, I just can't bring myself to give it the full five stars."},{"Title":"After the Fall (Star Trek (Unnumbered Hardcover))","review":"If you love Peter David's work, or if you are new to it, you will love this new installment.

As a New Frontier Junkie, I can say that it is worth the read, as is always the case in a Peter David book. I was not disappointed and am always amazed at the path Peter David takes his characters.

This book is not about hacking XP, but just some very rudimentary customization of XP. (Any lawyer willing to take up this case?)Written by a college student who runs a popular (but disorganized and misinformed) website for tweaking XP, the book is printed in tiny fonts on some low-quality paper. Reading through the book is no more fun than reading through the Bible for most of us. The text is poorly written with very few screenshots. This is a total waste of money. The author's website is equally poorly organized but at least it's free and has all the information contained in this book.Don't buy this book.

(Well okay, that and the fact that it was cheap). As a professional hacker I can assure you that there is nothing about hacking in here.

Most of the information in here is available in other places, and could be found relatively quickly with google if you knew what it was you were looking for. Most average users though don't know what they're looking for and therefore having a book which tells them that they can change their logon screen, startup screen, disable timestamps, and turn off unneeded services is useful. If you're a power user or sysadmin this book is a waste of your time.

The word &quot;hacking&quot; in the title refers to all the tweaks, modifications, optimizations, and customizations covered in the book.If you are a Windows XP user who already knows the basics, this book is the perfect source for making your Windows XP install your own. Steve Sinchak does a great job of guiding even first time &quot;hackers&quot; into the world of system customization.Contents at a Glance:Part I: Customizing Your SystemChapter 1: Customizing the Look of the StartupChapter 2: Customizing User NavigationChapter 3: Hacking the DesktopChapter 4: Customizing the Appearance of the Windows InterfaceChapter 5: Hacking Windows ExplorerChapter 6: Exploring Other Windows EnhancementsPart II: Increasing Your System's PerformanceChapter 7: Analyzing Your SystemChapter 8: Speeding Up the System BootChapter 9: Making Your Computer Load FasterChapter 10: Making Your Computer More ResponsiveChapter 11: Speeding Up Your ComputerPart III: Securing Your SystemChapter 12: Protecting Your Computer from IntrudersChapter 13: Fighting Spam, Spyware, and VirusesChapter 14: Protecting Your PrivacyThe first 6 chapters are about fiddling with the user interface and some pretty cool eye candy. You'll find out how to change the system bootscreen, building a custom Welcome/login interface, an easy way to recompile explorer.exe to change START button text (with the book it's not as hard as is sounds,) build virtual desktops, create custom themes, and hack Windows Explorer.Part II was the most interesting to me, and in my opinion is the best part of the book. If you are looking to squeeze every possible ounce of speed from your XP machine, here you will find answers. First you will get a snapshot of your system's current speed situation using some great benchmarking and analysis tools.Next,this book guides you through shaving time off the boot process by hacking the boot.ini file, tweaking BIOS settings, turning off services you dont need (complete with great explainations of what each one does, and a couple of suggested configurations for maximum boot speed,)and maximizing boot file location on the hard disk.Once the boot is complete, the book shows you how to make XP load faster by adjusting startup programs, making registry hacks to filesystem settings, and even network IP settings for faster load times.And when XP is up and running you'll get a look at how the prefetcher works, registry hacks to tweak its performance, boost Intel CPU performance, tune the paging file, optimize Internet connections for maximum speed, and boost the speed of your home network browsing.The book wraps up with some great tricks for securing your XP install, dealing with Viruses and Spyware, and protectig your privacy.This title does include a CD, and I generally write those off as a little gimmicky. But in this case, it adds tremendous value to the book. Not only does it come with 45 hacking tools and toys, most importantly it includes .reg files for registry hacks, and many of them have &quot;undo&quot; files if you want to revert to the old settings. Simply double clicking on these .reg files makes the registry hacks automatic, and keeps you from having to trudge through the Win XP registry.If you are a Windows XP beginner, this book is not for you. This is a great guide for Windows XP power users - those who know the basics, and are not afraid to dive in and do some under the hood work on their system. Recommended."},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"I think the main problem with this book is the title. It's not about hacking or hackproofing XP; it's about *customizing* it, and mostly in cosmetic ways. Any discussion about enhancing performance or security generally falls in the category of things you likely already know if you've spent a few years working with Windows. Trimming startup apps, turning off services, tightening network security. Good stuff for the beginner, to be sure. Aside from that, there is a lot of emphasis on changing the look and feel of the interface and using shareware apps.One element that may quickly begin to wear on non-teenagers is the level of writing. Practically every section begins something like this: \\"Such and such is a cool new feature in Windows XP and looks really great, but sometimes it gets kind of boring to look at, so I'll show you how to change it.\\" There is also a surprising number of grammatical and spelling mistakes in the book. My advice to the editor: it's hard to take a book seriously with such flabby writing and slangy style. This is a book, not a webpage. When it comes to grossly overused words like cool, neat, and great; I would advise the following formula for how many should be allowed in published material: Take the average age of your target audience, divide by the number of chapters in the book, divide that by the number of topics in each chapter, then multiply by zero.If you are a teenager who's really into themes, skins, fonts, and other eye candy, this is the book for you. You'll also learn some good basic tips about modifying more important parts of your system. But if you're a person who has supported Windows for years and is looking for serious hacks that can be described in ways other than \\"cool,\\" make sure you flip through the book before buying."},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"It is the explanations that make this such a treat. I have read dozens of tweaks in various places but rarely do they explain what is going on. This also makes it easy to undo them (there was one that turned off the old DOS naming of files that the new Roller Coaster Tycoon game did not like). I read through the book and bookmarked the 20 or so that I liked the most. Then I found a dozen more. Now every three pages are tweaks that I am doing to all the computers in the house and my relatives. It also opened my eyes to Windows XP styles. I have timidly tried WindowBlinds and I loved it! Enough gushing, but for me a great book."},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"I am a fairly advanced WinXP user and bought this book because it was recommended on tweakxp.com -- a website I refer to frequently for tips on how to optimize the look and performance of Windows XP. They noted that the book would not be like the website, but instead be a much more refined, organized, and in-depth guide to squeezing those last few drops of performance out of your system.They wrong.Yes, it is well-organized and well-written, but if you are at all interested in tweaking your Windows system to make it look and perform better, every single one of these 200+ \\"hacks\\" can be found on the Internet on tweakxp.com or by doing a simple Google search for Windows optimization tips.I will give the guide credit to publicizing small, lesser-known shareware products that are written to diagnose, analyze, or improve Windows performance. If you are interested in knowing what programs the author feels are top-of-the-line as of the publish date, this book may be worth the price to you.As it is, however, I recommend doing a few minutes of web searching and saving yourself $15."},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"If you're the type of computer user who likes to tweak the machine to do things it normally doesn't do, you'll like Hacking Windows XP by Steve Sinchak (Wiley).Chapter List:Part 1 - Customizing Your System - Customizing the Look of the Startup; Customizing User Navigation; Hacking the Desktop; Customizing the Appearance of the Windows Interface; Hacking Windows Explorer; Exploring Other Windows EnhancementsPart 2 - Increasing Your System's Performance - Analyzing Your System; Speeding Up the System Boot; Making Your Computer Load Faster; Making Your Computer More Responsive; Speeding Up Your ComputerPart 3 - Securing Your System - Protecting Your Computer from Intruders; Fighting Spam, Spyware, and Viruses; Protecting Your PrivacyAppendix A: What's on the CD-ROM; Index; End-User License AgreementI had no sooner opened the box that had this book in it, and my son immediately took off with it. Since he's the only one running XP in the house, I figured that was reasonable. In less than an hour, he had a whole new boot screen proclaiming his Windows XP OS to be the Doom 3 version with a video game wallpaper with no icons showing. He was also showing me how to set the priorities of certain tasks that were running with the Task Manager options. It's only taken me about three weeks to finally sneak it off his desk.Sinchak uses a variety of built-in features and third-party software to give you the ability to change many of the features of your system. If you want to change your boot-up screen, you'll have step-by-step instructions on how to do so. If you want to customize the way your windows act on the desktop, that's here too. While the Part 1 tweaks are more for fun, Part 2 gets more serious and useful. He goes into a number of tweaks and settings that will allow you to wring out every last drop of performance from your system. If you're running the latest and greatest Ghz CPU, you may not need to do these things, but PCs that are two or three years old could benefit from these settings.Good book, interesting material, and lots of fun to explore. I only wish my work laptop (that runs XP) wasn't so locked down... :-)"},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"The good thing about the book is that the steps are easy to follow & most technique's can be applied to most XP editions. It's also good in the fact that it doesn't get into too much theory, it gets straight to the point & shows the 'how to' & 'why to'What I didn't appreciate about the book is that most of these 'hacks' seem like a collection of customizations you can easily learn & find at any site on the net. If you are already scoping around the net for hacks & tweaks to your system & decided maybe this book can 'add more tricks in your book' then you might be in for an unpleasant surprise. At the end, you might even say to yourself \\"I could have written this & that chapter\\" (Assuming you have an intermediate level of PC knowledge)"},{"Title":"Hacking Windows XP (ExtremeTech)","review":"More for novice users.

O'Reilly has put out a series of these, each detailing 100 hacks. Now from Wiley, Sinchak talks about Microsoft Windows XP and provides us with over 200 hacks.A lot of hacks centre around customising various aspects of the UI. Not surprising. Appeals to those who like to fully explore what XP can do for you, going beyond the standard setup seen by the masses. Of necessity, Microsoft has to make the default setup somewhat of a least common denominator. That is the default UI was probably chosen after a lot of usability studies of what the typical user demands might be.But maybe you have special needs?Other parts of the book let you soup up system performance and beef up its security. (For the latter, especially defending against viruses and spyware.) I don't gainsay this utility. But a nagging feeling says that most of you will end up concentrating on tweaking the UI.

It shows you how to do many cool things in an easy to read and understand format. One reviewer wrote that all of the info in the book can be found on the web. Maybe if you illegally download the ebook version of this book.This book is loaded with unique content and is organized into a complete reference unlike any other XP book I have seen. The background information and undo help that the author provides makes the book very fun to read and you learn a lot about how Windows XP actually works.The book is organized into three main parts. The first part is called customizing your system. It talk about... well.. customizing the look of your computer. It starts off by talking about customizing the boot screen and then the welcome screen. Then, it guides you through customizing the look of the user interface. The author goes into great detail in showing you how to customize things you never even thought about.The second part of the book is called increasing your system's performance. First, the author covers how to analyze your computer for possible bottlenecks and even benchmark your computer so that you can have a base score to see how much faster you made your computer. Then they go through four chapters of tips to speed up your computer starting with the boot to general speed tips.The last part of the book is all about security. It talks about protecting your computer from hackers and how to fight spam, spyware, viruses, etc. This chapter was very useful as I had a lot of spyware on my computer and the book helped me get that junk off.Over all, I am very pleased with the book. It is not just a book of random tips like most XP books. Everything is organized just right with a lot of backgroud information which makes it fun to read.

It was very interesting to see the wide variety of topics that she covers in her art. Some of the statements she makes can sometimes be difficult to admit or to bring up, but she boldly states the truth of the matter. I highly reccommend this book to art students, as I am, because I think it teaches us a lesson on being brave in stating our message and opinions. Barbara Kruger is my hero, and after looking at this book, she'll be yours, too."},{"Title":"Love for Sale","review":"If you're not afraid to explore the darker areas of self (especially if you're a male) Kruger's work probes deep into the psyche of late 20th century patriarchal consumerism and the values of the dominant culture.Whether you love photography or love critical theory, Kruger will delight you and disturb your idea of self as you are dazzled by starkly arranged works that appear to read you instead of you reading them."},{"Title":"Love for Sale","review":"Barbara Kruger's art, often pairing appropriated black &amp; white photos with blocks of bold-faced type, has appeared on billboards, bus placards, posters, t-shirts and even shopping bags. She's big on circulating her stuff outside of conventional venues such as galleries and exhibits. This book showcases her brilliant work with plenty of full-page plates as well as photos of her installations and projects. There's a brief introduction covering her early design work for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine in the '60s and for various book covers in the '70s, up through her progression into the art world by the '80s. The pages of text are accompanied by assorted quotes from a variety of individuals (Edgar Allen Poe, Mae West, Sandra Bernhard). The influence of Kruger's stuff continues to turn up. Her work has been lifted for music videos (Motley Crue, Rage Against The Machine) and album covers (Snog, Consolidated), and her style is commonly imitated by lazy advertisers.

He does talk a good bit but he does not ramble here like I have heard him do on other recordings. The talking is actually helpful instead of distracting when you are listening on your ipod and his voice is your only cue. As some reviewers have pointed out this is not really a beginners set but I am not really sure a beginner should be learning yoga from an audio cd anyway. This set is for advanced beginners to intermediate practitioners. There are no pretzel positions but there are lots and lots of sun salutations and little rest of your wrists if you are not used to holding your body up for over an hour. Over all a really good routine that I turn to time and time again. Note: for people who do not like their yoga to \\"new agey\\" Kest is a good fit since although he does see yoga as a spiritual as well as physical practice his accent is little too New Yorker to be considered fluffy and he does not use flowery phrases like Yee and some others. If you like the P90X yoga and are looking for a new routine then he is probably your go to guy."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"A real live class is best, but this cd and booklet works very well as an alternative if you can't get to a real live class."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I've studied yoga for almost 10 years (all aspects) and I won't insult those real yogis and yoginis by calling Kest a yogi. But if you like your yoga instructors using gutter language, yelling it at you to instruct you through your practice like it's football practice in a most annoying voice, then Bryan Kest is your man! If you think his regaling of his in-studio audience with how he wants yoga to make him high, how \\"he wants to be stoned all day\\", is exactly how a yoga practice should be, then buy this CD.But if you are like a lot of people who use yoga as a method for recovery from substance abuse, or a method of drug-free stress management, or think teachers should treat students respectfully, or (heaven forbid) believe that a yoga instructor shouldn't be so obnoxious that all you can focus on is him, rather than yourself- breathing, posture, etc., then skip this CD. Kest does not bring anything worthwhile to the practice of yoga and if he were a true yogi, he would know exactly how and why he is exactly the kind of yoga practitioner that the authentic yogis and yoginis of the East warn Western practitioners about- the false practitioner (and there are unfortunately a lot of them, think:fly-by-night-yogis who got a certificate from a yoga-instructor-mill). There is a whole way of life, called the 8-limbs of Yoga some of which were espoused by Gandhi himself (ahimsa), which Bryan Kest clearly has no idea about because he does not observe them in his yoga instruction. I know of one yoga-instructor-mill which shall remain nameless,(and I am not claiming Kest comes from there) that wouldn't know a Yoga Limb if it bit them.Personally, I wasn't able to make it through the first 7 minutes of the first routine because of Kest's offensive demeanor. I threw the booklet and CD away shortly afterwards. I know a fake when I hear one. I know that there are far more respectful, talented and readily available \\"at-home yogis\\" products enough not to waste my hard-earned money on what Bryan Kest is peddling. Most likely the only reason he's even got a product on the market is because of his \\"connection\\" with Lisa Bonet-Kravitz-Lilakoi-Moon (or whatever she's calling herself these days)."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"It's in cd format, therefore one can do as little or as much as one can handle. It is actually a well rounded full body workout. I thought it might be lots of spinal stretching and relaxation, but it includes loads of strengthening for the spine and the core. Starts off with a spinal balancing sequence - table position on hands and knees with extended opposing arm and leg - then side arm balances with lots of variations, and extended cat pose...then seated poses with table (stomach towards ceiling) with lots of variations and much boat work. Then prone poses- swimming type work, yoga &quot;supermans&quot; and bow pose. Next track is variations on camel with great lateral stretches. Then standing balances which are quite advanced. Then there's an extra hips and legs section - reclining pidgeon and nice hip stretches which feel great. finishing poses include plow and shoulderstand and neck stretches. Plus of course my favourite spinal twists.In between the poses in the first tracks - mini flows - plank down to low pushup position, and cobras and down dog. All in all about 130 poses which include the transition poses.The booklet is great too. I thought it was going to be tiny - cd sized, but it's quite big - about 8 inches square, and spiral bound which is great - and every pose is photographed - Bryan doing the advanced version of the pose, and a female model showing modifications. There are also written instructiosn along all the poses. And there are a couple of cute dogs in some of the photos - nice touch - my cat likes to join me in my yoga practice, so I appreciated this.No music, but I don't mind. Music can be great, but it can be distracting.All in all a great find. I am really happy with my purchase, and plan to do it regularly."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I can't begin to say enough good things about this workout. I am an aficianada of Bryan Kest's original Power Yoga series from 1995. I also enjoy his new videos (especially Intensive Sculpting) from 2002. But...I just love this CD. It is the best workout that I have done in a long time - maybe ever. I thought initially that it might be weird working out without the visual imagery of video, but it is actually better. Bryan's voice is extra soothing, and his direction easily guides you from pose to pose without needing to look at the included book, (assuming that you know a few basic poses, such as cobra and down dog - the others he aptly describes.) I found myself more able to concentrate on the yoga, without distraction. The basic workout begins a bit more relaxed than his Power Yoga series, taking a bit more time to stretch, as opposed to getting your muscles &quot;hot&quot; right away. But before long, you find that your heart rate is getting up there and your muscles are working and that you are doing some invigorating but really challenging balances. This is spinal strenghening at its best, relaxation at its deepest. Bryan Kest's emphasis is, as always, on knowing your body and its limitations and first and foremost, feeling the breath. Another nice thing about this workout is that although it is divided between two CD's, the second CD is basically the last stretches and relaxation, so if you have a single CD player machine, you are not changing the discs in the middle of an intense pose. Also, you might like to do the relaxation CD by itself sometime, just to unwind. A bonus is the book, which has all of the poses and could be taken on a vacation even when you don't want to take the CD. This CD is great - and a day after doing this workout, all of my muscles feel like they got their fair workout. Six stars. Check it out."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I really like this Kest routine probably more than any other that I do (and I've done most of them). It is a very even split between stretching/relaxing and working hard. The flow of the routine seems to make a lot of sense to the mind and body as well. I have to admit that if I were stranded on an island with only one yoga routine, this would be the one I would pick.Because this class works on your core muscles, you will notice a big improvement in your back and stomach muscles if you practice consistantly. I have been doing this routine for several months and can tell a big difference in my body. When I started it, I was inflexible, had very little muscle, had some lower back pain, and had terrible balance. Even though I will probably not become a greek god from doing the routine, everything about my body and my mind has improved with regular practice.I think that if you were relatively new to yoga-- as in you know the basic poses: down dog, plank, cobra, camel, boat... but you're not great at them-- this would be a good routine with which to improve your practice. Bryan really gives great vocal cues about what you ought to be doing and feeling, so everyone can learn. The picture book is a great resource too and I studied it while doing the class the first time and checked in with it even weeks later to get another look at the pose and check myself. It feels so good for your back to stretch with the camel poses and the reverse boat series is SO challenging-- you get both sides of the coin with this routine.I have to admit that the standing balancing poses are VERY hard. Even after months of working at them, I still struggle with them. There was a time when I went through the routine just sitting on my mat during this section and later just bending over and touching the floor like the book suggests for a modification. I was frustrated. BUT, I hung in there and I now can do them and am getting better each time I practice. The main thing is to leave behind the idea that you need to look like the picture of Bryan in the book and just accept where you are.Bryan does talk a lot and I am always reading on these reviews that people find that irritating. Sometimes I do too. But, frankly, sometimes I need that to keep myself challenged and working in a pose. Other times, I make a challenge for myself to block him out, or I put on some other kind of music or TV quietly in the background so that I can just barely hear his cueing, but find it easier to tune out the non-essential talking when there is a din of sound to block it out. Also makes for a good challenge to keep focused on yourself.I think this is a really good yoga routine that can help you to get stronger in your core and calm down mentally. It's less active than a usual Kest power yoga routine, but for my money it is an excellent balance between stretching and working. I suggest this workout to anyone who wants to try Bryan out-- it's a good routine that will grow with you as you improve. Even though I never felt anything but happiness with this routine (except maybe the first few times when I was just sitting during the standing balancing), let me motivate you: if you find it difficult or challenging, keep trying a while before you give up-- that difficulty is your chance to grow!"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I love this CD for what it does for my back. I am much stronger in Cobra,upward bow and camel. I do it once a week on Sunday mornings. OK, so Bryan's asana terminology is offense, i.e. downward doggy, crotch asana, crotch candy. Maybe no one told him that women outside of Los Angeles don't like that stuff and serious yogi like you to refer to the poses by their real english names or better yet sanskrit names. Regardless, I take out it what I need. He doesn't do Bridge pose or Upward Bow, so I add these. After the spinal work, I just float up, which is no easy feat for me since I am a healthy girl. Get this one. Your spine will love you."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I really enjoyed this CD, but I think it's important to note that it's called \\"Spinal Strengthening,\\" not \\"Spinal Repair.\\" It isn't appropriate for someone who is currently injured. Your back needs to be pretty strong & healthy to do this practice. It's actually a good all-around practice, and the instructor gives you plenty of time to get into the asanas and feel the benefits. That's what I like about Bryan Kest. A lot of other teachers who do this type of practice move too fast and have the same old asanas. He puts a different spin on it, and I enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"I read the reviews and ignored previous reviewers comments (of his other products) regarding Kest's voice and the phrases he uses. I didn't take them seriously because I thought they were just trying to be rude. But after I received the CD I couldn't even bring myself to try doing the routine, which is disappointing because it seems to be a good one. His voice is distracting, he moans and uses annoying phrases like \\"downward doggy.\\" Even if I got through the CD once, I know I wouldn't be able to handle listening to it again without going crazy. If you're looking for a CD/Video etc to do on a regular basis, I think you'll find this one will get old very quickly. Maybe it's because I'm used to David Swenson's excellent Short Forms video. I find Swenson's approach to be a good balance between instruction, encouragement and silence; he doesn't talk more than is necessary and his voice and comments are easy to listen to over and over again. So if you enjoy Swenson's approach stick with it and avoid Kest. I gave Kest's CD two stars because I like the sequence in the workout, but I don't like how Kest works you through the routine (although other people may find his approach exactly what they're looking for). But I have several yoga dvds (in addition to Swenson's) and Kest's is the only one I wish I didn't purchase (and it was the most expensive of all of them too!)."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"This is a great yoga workout. The CD and book are easy to follow along with. The routine is challenging but fun. It's an hour and a half long, but goes by extremely fast and really strengthens your back muscles."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"This Bryan Kest routine has a number of advanced elements, cobras and other poses held for 5 breaths or more, a standing pose sequence that is quite intense, a plough pose that would not be recommended for a beginner, etc. Nevertheless, many of the more difficult sequences can be easily modified or skipped over making this an approachable yet challenging practice. Note again that poses are held for reasonable amounts of time, so those of you expecting a fast movement vinyasa flow workout might be disappointed-this one will not cause you to break a sweat- still, there is generally ample opportunity to \\"sink\\" into the poses should that be your preference. Note that this is primarily a core routine with a couple of sequences of push-ups thrown in- no lunges, warriors or triangles.Kest's focus here is on the breath- maintaining an even, deep breathing flow through the nose and by deep he doesn't mean hyperventilation (good advice as I found myself huffing and puffing on a few of the more challenging poses). Other reviewers found his voice and comments distracting at best and often irritating. Tastes vary of course, but I found his comments encouraging and his instructions to the point and helpful. The spiral bound booklet is of good quality and useful but I imagine most people will be able to dispense with it after some experience with the routine. The audio is spread over 2 CD's and lasts a full 90 minutes. Having a multi disc player or downloading to an iPod would insure continuity.Beginners should consider this product only after becoming familiar with a decent variety of yoga poses (taking several classes would prove useful) and with a good understanding of their (the practitioners') limitations (I should know I'm a beginner). However, approached with this knowledge and a healthy dose of patience, this could prove a rewarding program."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"Great exercises for a bad back. I started doing yoga with Bryan Kest with his original 3-part Power Yoga series, then I took great classes in the NYC area, and now I moved to the Philly suburbs. This CD is the best class I've taken since moving. It's great if you already have a background in yoga, not for beginners, but I love it."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","review":"There are 2 CDs in the package, and I've done just the first CD which encompasses a little over 1 hour. It's quintessential Bryan. The poses are quite similar to those found in Intensive Body Sculpting, like the pretty challenging \\"half-moon pose\\" (which I haven't yet managed to perfect, but I'm working on it) but you also get a lot of boat poses for your core/abs (boat pose is when sitting, you raise your legs up straight until you form a \\"V\\" shape and you hold your legs for about five breaths, with your arms parallel to the ground) and a bunch of spinal stretches.Overall, I thought the CD was good. It's part strengthening/part stretching, and complements Bryan's other practices. I don't know if there are other yogis who do poses like Bryan does his. I've tried Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti (which I didn't like) and some Baron Baptiste (which I didn't think was as challenging as Bryan Kest). So it's safe to say I'm a Bryan-Kestophile. His stuff really gets me going.Very strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Graveyard Gambit","review":"One of the few mystery novels I've read that kept me guessing all the way to the end.

In \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" William C. Davis fills those many pages with a narrative that seems to me the most authentic, objective, and substantiated account connected to the well-known but often-distorted events of 1836.As the title indicates, Davies' organizing focus is on the biographies of the three American principals at San Antonio: David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Travis. He traces their lives in interleaved chapters that follow a generally chronological path. None of the three turn out to be anything near the paragons of virtue and/or honesty depicted in the standard accounting. Courage they most certainly had, but in Davies' retelling it was a courage born of self-interest and opportunism. Of the three, only Crockett's story leaves us feeling any great sympathy toward its subject. Still, even in this revisionist account, their lives maintain an unsurpassed power to both instruct and excite.Bowie is depicted as a land-speculator of the most dishonest kind. He achieved his fortune largely by forging Spanish Land Grants in Louisiana. Davies shows that in this he was hardly unique, although perhaps an over-achiever.Travis led a short and mysterious life, and his character remains elusive despite Davies' prodigious research. Like many of the Alamo defenders, he came to Texas to reinvent himself and to leave behind a failed past. Davies does his best to sort out the details of that abandoned past life.Crockett's road to a legendary death is well-told here in all its diversity. Davies is especially convincing in dealing with Crockett's political career, characterizing it as one marked by \\"navet&eacute;, miscalculations, and simple blunders.\\" And the author's detailing of the manipulation of Crockett by the Whig press and party leadership gives a dimension to the story that is not often treated. Despite a generally cynical portrayal, the author also provides ample evidence of Crockett's more appealing traits, which go far in explaining why this defeated ex-Congressman was received with such enthusiasm in Texas.The events at the Alamo actually take up a small portion of the book, but a \\"small portion\\" here is still a substantial serving. There are also approximately 160 pages of Notes. I'd advise the reader not to skip them. Davies not only discusses there some of the major controversies of his subjects' lives and of the war's details; he also relegates some of the best stories to those pages - presumably because of their debatable legitimacy.While Davies deals effectively with the ambiguities of the mission's final battle, I feel his most vital accomplishment is in showing his three subjects to be \\"in every way men of their time.\\" In this sense, the book is as much about the dynamics of American life in the middle third of the 19th-century, and of Texas as an exemplar of American values, good and bad. It's also a damn good read."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"I'm not sure if William C. Davis' \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" is a reinterpretation of the 1836 Alamo siege more than it is a truly exhaustive study of the three men who define that battle. A detailed and fascinating examination of the lives of David Crockett, James Bowie and William Barret Travis, \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" cuts through the myth and legend, revealing the dirt and substance of these men's lives en route to their eventual deaths in San Antonio.Certainly the myth of Crockett is dented somewhat, as we see that he is a man clumsy in politics, impatient with family life, seeking the next adventure. Bowie also comes across as a rather scandalous man, involved in shady land and slave dealings which would have most certainly placed him in jail today. And finally Travis, whose life has never before been examined with such detail, comes across as a rather poor businessman, constantly in debt and a obsessive womanizer to boot.Like all great historical figures shrouded in myth, it was only a matter of time before modern-day historians placed these Texas revolutionary heroes beneath a very un-romantic, yet 21st century microscope. So it comes as a rather stunning surprise that after these three statue-like figures are dressed down in human fashion, by battle's end they still, somehow, manage to put their past behind them and become heroes in spite of their many flaws.I'm not sure if Mr. Davis did this intentionally, just as I'm not sure if you could truly draw a portrait of these men and this battle and not find shades of extraordinary heroism within the walls of that mission fortress. Certainly, John Wayne's infamous 1960 film \\"The Alamo\\" is anything but the truth, but the great unvarnished fact about this story is that even with the bones revealed, these men still come across as noble and heroic, having seized an incredible moment in time, thus surviving for all eternity.And that, undoubtedly, is what continues to fascinate Americans, if not world citizens, about this battle. These men, while holding out for the hope of reinforcements, chose to stay, eventually sealing their doom. Yes, the line may not have been drawn in the sand, but in \\"Three Roads to the Alamo,\\" that obvious fact becomes surprisingly irrelevant. Warts and all, these men's lives serve as the proper contrast to their eventual final deeds, making their decisions in 1836 all the more unforgettable.\\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" is a intimately detailed historic work, which will fascinate all readers interested in this legendary battle. Arguably, it is one of the finest books yet written about this 13-day siege."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"How close did David Crockett come to being presidient of the United States? Closer than you might think. That's one of the many interesting issues covered in \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" This book is deep and well researched. The foot notes were as interesting as the book itself. Most Bubba Texas history buffs never considered Crockett, Bowie and Travis until they bite the big bullet. We sometimes forget that Davy Crockett was not much more than a tourist. He had just lost an election and made one campaign promise that he kept. He said, \\"If I lose this election I'll either go to hell or Texas.\\" He chose Texas. His travels led him to San Antonio at a time that coincided with the defense of the Alamo. James Bowie was a land swindler that forged a lot of Spanish land grants in Louisiana and did a poor job of that. He was kind of hiding out from creditors and enjoying his new squeeze, a pretty local girl from a influential San Antonio family. She died of typhus that rampaged the area and Jim went into a depression that kept him from a timely exit from San Antonio. William Travis was thriving in Texas with a law practice. Only after he had sneaked out of Alabama leaving a family and lots of debt. This book does a great job of explaining how these three men came together and rose above their short comings to lead a brave defense of the Alamo."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"The story of the Alamo has become the stuff of legend. The names most associated with the Alamo-James Bowie, David Crockett, and William Barret Travis-have taken on a mythological aura-especially in Texas. Davis' goal here is not to tell the story of the Alamo again (the actual battle covers very few pages) but to take a look behind the legends and attempt to draw a human portrait of these three heroes of the Alamo with flaws (and there are a lot of flaws here) and all.David Crockett had already become the stuff of legend by the time he made his way to the Alamo. Davis implies he only referred to himself as Davy to further the popular image of himself as a nave back woodsman. David further implied that Crockett was inept and selfish at best in politics and neglectful of family. Of the three, however, Crockett does emerge as the most sympathetic. Bowie is presented as shady at best. In his pre-Alamo days, Bowie was a greedy speculator who was not above slave-trading or colossal dishonesty in the attempt to acquire land. There is little source material for Travis' life. Yet, Davis is able to draw a convincing picture of this failed lawyer who fled his native state to flee financial collapse and professional ruin.Ultimately, what will cause this book to become a classic on this near-mythological battle will be that Davis examines these three guys as human and not as solely legends. If he had chosen to write one book on each of these three it would have been a good book; by choosing to write about all three in one book he has produced a great book."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Three thorough biographies in alternating chapters, trace the life journies of distinct personalities whose fate converged at a broken-down mission.

The first are the trailblazers, like Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone. Then come the speculators seeking to make a quick profit (like James Bowie) and then come the \\"nesters,\\" the teachers, lawyers (like William Travis), homesteaders who make a community. William O. Davis' fascinating book offers three short biographies of three very different men and how they all came to meet their fate at the Alamo. Crockett is the most endearing. He comes across as a very sweet-natured and good-hearted person who strives very hard to improve himself. Bowie was an out-and-out crook and con-man. (His story is really pretty shocking to someone who grew up with the hagiography of Texian heroes!) Travis also had a few skeletons in his closet, in that he came to Texas to escape an unpleasant personal situation elsewhere. But people like these men were the founders of The Republic of Texas. It's my observation that some of the most successful Texans have combined aspects of all these men. (Lyndon Johnson and Ross Perot immediately come to mind.) Even though I'm a native Texan (some my ancestors came to Texas with the Robertson colony and another fought at San Jacinto), there were a lot of things that were new to me in this book. This is insightful and incisive writing. I recommend it to all lovers of Texas history. It has deepened my understanding of everything else I have read on the subject."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Ever since I was a introduced to Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, the 1950's television series created by Walt Disney and Fess Parker, I was awe-inspired by his legend and death at the Alamo. To a lesser degree, James Bowie and William Barrett Travis held similar positions in my mind. This does not discount or minimize in any way the contribution and ultimate sacrifice of the other 200 or so volunteers at the battle of the Alamo.But I always hungered for more information about these men, what made them \\"tick\\", and what motivated them to make that valiant last stand. This book by William C. Davis has finally filled that void for me. I can't say enough good things about it!As another reviewer has pointed out, the end notes are nearly 200 pages in length and add considerable detail and depth to the narrative. I found myself not only flipping back and forth to review them, but reading them one after another as if they WERE the narrative itself!The research that the author has obviously done on his subjects is almost beyond belief. He presents these three individuals with the detail and depth that finally allows us to begin to view them on a more human level. He removes the bigger than life legends that surround them, revealing not only their strengths of character, but weaknesses as well.In short, I cannot recommend this book more highly. It is a truly great piece of work. Thank you, Mr. Davis!!!"},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Three key figures in the Alamo legend, three biographies intertwined into a single story. Davis is able to write parallel accounts of the lives of Crockett, Bowie and Travis, so that the reader knows what the others have been up to while reading about the third. Meticulous research, and Davis does not bog down the narrative with long explanations about sources. However, he does supply adequate information in the notes at the end of the book, for those who are fond of reading them. Perhaps the most interesting information to come from the book is the shattering of myths surrounding these three men. Travis was a failure in life, whose law career didn't pick up until he abandoned his native Alabama--and his wife and family--for Texas. Bowie was a swindler, who forged documents claiming to be Spanish land grants for land in present-day Arkansas and Louisiana. And Crockett was the Jesse Ventura of his day, an unlettered self-promoter who became nationally known in the early 1830s and parlayed his fame into a political career that eventually collapsed for lack of substance. A great American story, \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" can be enjoyed by anyone--even Texas newcomers like me."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"This may be the best history book I have ever read. It is in the same league as &quot;The Guns of August&quot; and &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;. Davis illuminates the lives of three of the greatest American heroes--heroes whose lives were previously shrouded in their own glory. We all know the Davy Crockett played by Fess Parker--the King of the Wild Frontier. Our images of Jim Bowie and William B. Travis come to us from John Wayne's Alamo rendition. But these men have no flaws--they are not human. Davis brings us back to reality by showing that they were simply men of their times.The parallel biography is an excellent vehicle for driving this story, especially, as Davis points out, since the three men in the story represent the three levels of civilization. You have Crockett, the trail blazer, Bowie, the speculator, and Travis, the settler. Each has his own unique qualities, and adds a dimension to this tale of Jacksonian America.It is apparent that Davis was bound and determined to correct the myths around these three men, and for the most part he succeeds. He seems to come down unduly hard on Crockett, but then again, Crockett's image needed the most redressing. However, he does not totally undo the Crockett myth, with his much more heroic description of Davy at the Alamo. Bowie and Travis are also cut down, but to lesser degrees. In fact, Davis almost plays down Bowie's land schemes and he is obviously the author's favorite.As for the book itself, it is very readable if somewhat long. But once you pick it up, you will not want to put it down as Davis brings these men alive, and in the end, you truly feel their loss. It is a unique story, because as it progresses, it seems these men are invincible--giants in their own age, but we all know how the story ends, and yet still find ourselves wishing something will happen and history will change. Not many books can accomplish that kind of involvement. &quot;Three Roads to the Alamo&quot; does."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Extremely well researched documentary.

Great, great read!"},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"OK, that is a bit of a negative title, so I want to start off saying that I really enjoyed this book. One of the problems with the story of the Alamo is that it all too often is isolated in the time during the battle and not much of the events and lives of the participants are ever explored. This leaves a story disconnected from all that ran up to it, all that caused it.William C. Davis does an admirable job assembling the lives of three people who are somewhat elusive in the historical record until their \\"big day\\" at the Alamo (even Crocket has his blank spots in his history). It is important info that informs us all why these men were \\"that\\" Travis, Crocket and Bowie.He gives them life in a narrative that quickly moves in a conversational style. Further, he does an admirable job not judging these men on today's more \\"civilized\\" standards, allowing us to come to know the men as they were, in their day, without being weighed down by modern approbations and regrettable \\"social\\" historical analysis so popular with too many historians.Now the criticism: As my little review title suggests I feel that there was one road, one equally important, not explored that led to the Alamo. It is a road that is just as important as the other roads Davis explores; that of Travis, Crocket, and Bowie.It is a road without which the Alamo would not have occurred, propelling the three heroes into American mythology. It is the road traveled by Santa Anna.Of course, at 587 pages, this tome is already a bit larger than the average popular treatment of any particular historical event and it is probable that Davis struggled to keep the story under one thousand! Still, Santa Anna's journey was just as tumultuous, interesting and central to the story as Travis, Crocket, and Bowie's, and just as important.Davis admits that he started with the idea of a Bowie bio, so it isn't surprising that he dwelled on Bowie more so than the other two. But, given the re-direction he took with his story a little less on Bowie could have sufficed as the story of Santa Anna was included.After reading the book, I felt a hole in the story. Why, exactly, did the Mexicans do all they did? Not just during the months preceding the Alamo, but for the decade before. How did Santa Anna get to his position? What drove him to lay siege to the Alamo and that small band of Norteamericanos? I know Santa Anna is not the American hero that the other three are, but where is the hero without the villain?In any case. This book is highly recommended for anyone wanting a well researched story of the actions and personalities that led up to the Alamo.

It covers a mythic battle that the reader is sure to know in outline, if not better. It peeks behind the myths, only to discover more heros. Further, it makes the story a parable about North America. There is nothing better.It's interesting how the author keeps us guessing about the 'true nature' of our heros. James Bowie starts out the most offensive of rogues, but ends up finding something more important than money. David Crockett starts off a Disney hero, but ends up being a rather befuddled witness to history (or perhaps a magnet for it).Finally, one shouldn't ignore the way Williams dances through the jingoistic pot-holes. There is a great deal of jingoistic blather laid down by the Disney version of the Alamo, not to mention what some Texans think. The Texas revolution was primarily a fight for the US slave system and real estate riches. The liberties so proudly linked to the Alamo included the liberty to treat people like cattle. The Disney version hides this by playing Mexican President Santa Anna as a 19th century King George the III, but no serious reader can ignore the absurdity of such a claim.Williams minces no words about the jingoistic aspect of his three biographies. While reading, one wonders if he isn't just setting all three up for a concluding disgrace.This brings me to what I think the best aspect of the book. It tells a straight story that both Hispanic and Anglo can read. There is more to the story than land swindles, robbing the natives and slavery. The story describes how Hispanic and Anglo cultures can blend, a story of growing importance. There is a great deal more to tell, but I like the way this section of it was told."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Go's way to much in depth as to what they paid for everything.

When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\" The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.Author William C. Davis does not follow this advise and gives us the true story of these three icons of Texas. We find that aside from Crockett's three successful congressional campaigns and Travis' legal practice in Texas, these heroes were not very successful nor particularly honorable as that term is defined today. Bowie was an unsuccessful con artist who married his Tejano wife for her money and connections, Travis abandoned his pregnant wife in Alabama to evade a warrant for his arrest for debt, and Crockett was long estranged from his second wife at the time of his death. They were not exactly paragons of virtue but in the manner of their deaths they were and are heroes and that should not be forgotten, and Davis does not forget this. I am reminded of a line from another movie, Casablanca, in which Humphrey Bogart says, \\"They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.\\" Bowie, Crockett and Travis are Texas' Honored Dead."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Very thorough and well-organized. The story lays to rest the myths good and bad of these three heroes of the Alamo, but this only serves to make them more human and far more interesting. As a Texan who was raised on many of the legends, I was a little upset that some of the stories may not be true (the line in the sand), but was actually more impressed with the three as individuals by the end of the book, and appreciated more the often contentious road to Texan independence. Furthermore, while the book focuses mainly on Bowie, Crockett, and Travis, there are tremendous insights into many individuals and processes involved in the revolution, including reflections on the reluctant leadership of Stephen F. Austin (whom I greatly respect) and the unsteady and unpredictable leadership of Sam Houston (whom I do not). Very informative and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"This book is a very well conceived idea that tries to understand what happened at the Alamo through the eyes of three people. Each provides a different perspective to life in Texas and life in the United States in the time period leading up to the Alamo. A crook like Bowie has fled from land speculations schemes and is trying to make a name for himself in Texas. Travis has abandoned his family and gone to make an honest life and escape the debt he built up. Finally we have David Corckett the hero of Tennessee who has lost elections and patience with Andrew Jackson heading to Texas. All of these three have led colorful lives with Crockett being the most interesting. This book serves as a biography to all three while describing the importance of the Alamo to Texas. It is very well done and you find yourself going through the book very quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in understanding what life looked like in the United States in the years leading up to the Alamo."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Not much more here than has already been said, though I feel the real coup de grace was Davis's willingness and ability to gather previously difficult to obtain information in the Mexican military archives.The reference and support information alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"The research is incredible. I even read all the notes, and they are as facinating as the book. I wish he had spent another couple of hundred pages on Travis' diary. His conclusions on Houston were a bit on the ruthless side. The Alamo was going to fall, no matter how many reinforements were sent. But, this story needed to be told by someone who would take the time to &quot;look it up&quot;. And, look it up is exactly what Mr. Davis has done!"},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"This has to be the best Alamo book I have read to date. The lives of the 3 main characters of the Alamo cast are layed out before you. The biography of Crockett,Travis and Bowie really gives one insight into what these men were made of. Having just returned from a vacation in the city of San Antonio, my reading of this book really made my visit to The Alamo a wonderful experience. This is a fine word of history."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"I have always suspected that the events I \\"know\\" about the Alamo were not entirely accurate, and now, from reading Three Roads to the Alamo, I find that most of what I knew was myth or outright fabrication. But the really interesting discovery is that the truth is much more evocative than the myth.A biography of any one of these men would be a quite a job by itself, but William Davis has written three meticulously researched biographies and has combined them into the definitive history of the Alamo. Don't be deterred by the length of this book; serious researchers will appreciate the detail, but for the rest of us Davis writes in a smooth and satisfying style. Once their mythology is stripped away, Bowie, Crockett and Travis come to life as real men, and we follow their fascinating lives as their paths lead them toward their fate. We become immersed in their stories, as if they were characters in literature.If you could only read one book about the Alamo, Three Roads to the Alamo would be your best choice."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"This is an impressive work. Davis has penned a fine narrative with a truly impressive amount of research and detail. The obvious scholarly effort is quite astounding, even if all the minute details of Jim Bowie's multiple land fraud schemes become somewhat mind numbing in their exacting detail. But where the author truly shines is in his perspective and painting of the larger canvas of these three amazing and quite different American heros. He answers the question that was in the forefront of my mind when I first visited the grounds held sacred to all loyal Texan (or Texians), namely, how did these three amazing individuals, Crockett, Bowie, and Travis end up in this ruined Spanish mission? The answer is enjoyably laid out in this book. A crackin' good historical read. My only quibble and criticism is with Mr. Davis' characterization of James Bowie's early efforts to financially prosper by smuggling slaves illegally into the United States just prior to 1820 in Chapter Two: &quot;It showed him a species of crime easy on the conscience because it left no victim yet still offered considerable profit. He stole from no one when he smuggled slaves.&quot; I fairly wanted to scream out: What about the slaves themselves! Weren't they victims? Mr. Bowie certainly had this blind spot so characteristic of this era in the southern United States, but Mr. Davis has less of an excuse. Still, I don't want to sound like the PC police and detract too much from this fine work, hence the 5 stars."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Now I know all the details of Bowie's land schemes and Travis's shortcomings as a lawyer but for the life of me I can't figure out what the author dislikes about poor old Davey. Its true that Bowie was a land shark as were many of the Louisiana gentry as well as the United States government. Travis I can excuse because of his youth and he died writing the most stirring appeals in Texas and American history. Of course few hear them today in the politically correct society that we now have.The author takes Crockett to task for the very things that made him an American legend before he became the symbol of the Alamo. Poor Crockett could do nothing to please this author. If he stood by his convictions he was a bumbling neer to well. If he compromised he was betraying his constituency. As was said by a much greater writer years back,'when the legend is greater than the truth, print the legend'. Or at least hold back snide comments and analysis. Despite the bias flaws this work will give you a chance to see the turmoil and the many facets of these three men. Sadly it is lacking in information of the fateful thirteen days of glory."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"This is the most important book about the Alamo and its heroes to appear in the last three decades. Davis has undertaken meticulous research, including review of previously unseen documents in Mexico's military archives, to construct new, revealing biographies of the three most celebrated Alamo heroes. Especially valuable are the sketches of Bowie and Travis, about whom there are no earlier satisfactory biographies. Many will find Travis's story completely new, and Davis portrays the Alamo commander as an important political leader of the Texian revolt, whose death was an incalculable loss to that cause. Bowie, on the other hand, is something of a rogue, forever scheming to turn a dishonest dollar through slave smuggling or land fraud. However, Davis also captures Bowie's daring, bravery, and leadership capabilities, particularly in battle. Crockett's story is more familiar, but Davis adds new interpretation and assessment of the frontier politician and folk hero,! deftly distinguishing the two and tracing the emergence of the fictional \\"Davy,\\" partially by Crockett's own design. Other historical figures, particularly Sam Houston, do not fair so well, and Davis reveals the petty politics that may have led to abandonment of the doomed Alamo garrison. The work is not intended as a study of the Alamo itself, and the siege and battle are confined to a single chapter. Nonetheless, Davis has uncovered new information and formed unique insights about the event and the actions there of the three heroes. Much myth is stripped away, and Davis reveals the human failings of the three figures, who still emerge as courageous men of stubborn conviction, in many ways typical of those who sought to improve their fortunes by exploiting opportunities along America's expanding frontier. The book deserves a place beside such highly-regarded Alamo works as Walter Lord's \\"A Time To Stand.\\""},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"As a Tennessee native and a Texan by choice, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Davy Crockett was the representative from the Congressional district where I grew up and it was very enjoyable to learn more about how things were when my ancestors first came into the area. The book also reveals a lot about who each of the three main characters really were and offers a lot of insight into the War For Texas Independence. It should be mandatory reading for Texans.Sam McGowan,Vietnam Veteran and Author of \\"The Cave,\\" a novel of the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Almost immediately after the Alamo fell March 6, 1836, it became shrouded in so many myths that there's still some that people hold firm beliefs in today. Naturally, the majority of the myths and legends surround the three main personalities: David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William Barret Travis.This book attempts to strip away all of the folklore that has become virtually synonymous with these three. Their lives are laid bare, showing the common reader that they were human, after all. The legendary Crockett had political troubles, Bowie was notorious for dealing heavily in land swindles and slavery, and Travis was pretty much a failure at everything before packing up and moving to Texas (unfortunately, leaving his family behind him in Alabama). Despite showing their flaws and shortcomings, however, the author does not attempt to undermine their brave stand at the Alamo. He maintains that they fought for what they believed in, and that makes them admirable.This book is unique in that it is, essentially, a triple biography. There is not one complete section for each of the three subjects; rather, the book is written so that the chapters alternate between each of them. This provides the reader with a sense of where the other two were and what they were doing while maintaining a primary focus on the third. While it is quite a hefty tome, it is at the same time quite readable and enjoyable to boot. Davis clearly has done his homework and hopefully this will become one of the quintessential books on the Alamo."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"After spending a semester of my college life studying William Barret Travis, I became versed on the Texas Patriot's life. Authors who wrote singly on Travis have not scratched the surface on his life. But, Davis has, in his triple biography of Travis, Crockett, and Bowie, effectively described in amazing detail the life of William Barret Travis. He bests those who focused only on the young Texan. His work is first-rate and second to none. 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"and others have greatness thrust upon them...This seems to be the theme of this excellent book, dealing the &quot;Alamo Trinty&quot; of Crockett, Bowie and Travis. None of these men were born great, but wound up achieving (in the case of Travis) or having it thrust upon them..(Crockett and Bowie)All of these men were flawed, Travis and Crockett with irreponsibilty and Bowie a general disregard for the law. (The book doesn't say this, but you get the impression that Bowie's death wasn't terribly far ahead of an arrest warrent..)Crockett had failed in two terms as a congressman, but not really through any fault of his own in this case. He had angred Andrew Jackson,and in the election of 1835, told the voters he had done his best and if they didn't like it,&quot;You can go the hell and I'll go to Texas&quot; (not &quot;I'll go to hell or Texas&quot; as another reviewer puts it.

Travis, Crockett and Bowie are revealed as full human beings not caricatures or tall-tale characters. The research is exhaustive and the portraits of the men are clear and strong. One knows the tragic event that sealed their fate, and Davis debunks some of the myth clouding the Alamo and the three men inextricably linked to it. It is also a book about a young country and the unique and fascinating men that forged the American West. Not just for Alamo enthusiasts--there's plenty here for everyone! It contains the exhaustive research, humor, attention to detail and &quot;readability&quot; that characterize Davis' books. If you've read his Civil War books--give this one a try! If you've never read him, it's a great introduction to his style. Quite Simply a GREAT read."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"OK, I read every book written on the Alamo, so I had to read this one. While you have to plow through a lot of history of these three that occurs before they ever reach Texas, I must say I learned new things about each. There is no question - they are not the guilded &quot;heros&quot; we have worshipped for so long in Texas, but I like them better as real people. Not necessarily an &quot;easy&quot; read, but if you follow Texas history, a must read."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"It's fairly obvious that by themselves, neither David Crockett, James Bowie nor William Barrett Travis would merit a full-scale biography. In fact, even together it becomes a stretch.Of the three, Crockett certainly comes the closest because of his extended exposure on the national stage, while Travis due to his short life span, leaves the author very little to actually talk about.So this leaves James Bowie and my goodness!! ... how much minutiae about land speculation and fraud does one need to read before they've heard enough about Bowie's life prior to The Alamo?!? His entire life up to 1834 could have easily been summed up in about 50 pages, and Travis in about 25 pages.Instead, we grind through almost 400 pages before the author finally reaches the point most people picked the book up for in the first place. Specifically, how the heck did these three end up together defending The Alamo?Don't get me wrong ... the historical and political backstory concerning the American frontier, Texas land speculation, and Jacksonian politics is important, and this book helps to clarify the issues and to explain how things occured as they did.But, the convoluted (and frankly boring) facts involving every single honest and dishonest facet of Bowie's career in land speculation was almost enough to cause me to put the book down.I've enjoyed hearing William C. Davis on shows like Civil War Journal, etc., but this is the first time I've read him.Not sure I'll read him again after this."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"William C. Davis is one of the more prolific historians writing today. He seems to come out with at least one book a year. This one is a good overview of the Texas Revolution, with specific focus on William Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett. Arguably the most famous participants, along with Sam Houston, they are subject to much mythmaking and legend. To this reader, the value of this book comes from the author and publishers national marketability. State history, even of the type this well known, tends to be a local affair, and it is easy for passions to get aroused in the telling of the Alamo story in Texas. Davis does not seem to have a dog in this fight, so his overview is more general and on the whole, more informative. Instead of endless speculation about how Davy died, or whether Travis drew a line in the sand, we get the full picture of what brought these men to Texas, and what happened to them when they got there. It would be an excellent starting point for someone interested in the Alamo or any aspect of Texas history."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"I'm a little over half way done with the book and I'm enthralled by the story. I'm learning things about the road to the Alamo that I've never known before, and I've read about the Alamo for a while.What is frustrating the hell out of me are the typos in the Kindle version. David Crokett? \\" move faster than a company with its impendimenta.\\" Seems like every chapter has 4 or 5 typos in it. I have to reread some sentences several times to fully understand what the author is trying to sayThe problem with so many typos is that when they put in numbers, I'm not sure if they are actual or typos. Are the names correct? Like I said above, most of the typos I can deduce what they are trying to say. \\"os Texas\\" becomes the proper \\"of Texas\\" on review. It just slows me down and frustrates.But on the other hand, the story is well researched and gripping. I'm continuing to read it despite the typo handicap. I just hope that Amazon does an edit and rereleases the book. If I was William C. Davis I would be appalled at the typos."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Quick! Name the three most famous battles fought on what is now US soil! Well, there may be some room for discussion but I would go with (in no particular order) The Battle of the Little Big Horn, Gettysburg, and The Battle of the Alamo. Two of these have their stature largely established on legend more than fact since there were few, if any, surviving witnesses from the side that most of us focus on. Indeed, little use has been made of the observations of the winning sides. Most references I've read discount most of the eyewitness accounts. This leaves two of the three battles with a limited availability of historical sources (while books on Gettysburg continue to emerge with new sources, interpretations and perspectives). In view of the apparent limitations he had to work with, what William C. Davis has done for the Battle of the Alamo is a truly impressive work of research, organization and perspective.Be forewarned; this book of 587 pages of text and roughly 160 pages of footnotes uses merely 4 or 5 pages to tell of the Battle itself. Davis relies almost exclusively on Sutherland's \\"Fall of the Alamo\\" which is rather less extravagant than popular legend. While this book limited its' account of the actual battle, it gives, perhaps, the best written account of the events leading up to the Battle. It does so, as its' title implies, by focussing on the lives of Davy Crockett, James Bowies and William Barret Travis.The threee men's lives display three seperate directions and give us three seperate understandings of the motivations of men in that time and place. Crockett was the explorer who became restless each time civilization moved into the neighborhood. He was the most famous of the three both in his time and in History and his was the life we enjoyed reading the most. His political career was \\"interesting\\" but not worthy of any more impressive adjective. His demise was the event that elevated his life but he would have been remembered even without the Alamo (albeit by far fewer people).James Bowie was the wheeler dealer whose land-grabbing schemes were so boldly and so crudely illegal that most readers will find themselves having to make excuses to keep plodding through the morass of thievery. In time his exploits become more engrossing to the reader but there was always a new angle to twist in order to create a new fortune on paper. Bowie's bravery in Texas might have elevated his name higher than it was had he not already been half-dead with Typhoid Fever before the Battle even began. As it was, his name would have been obscure in modern times had it not been for the Alamo. His knife and his legal trail of fraudulent claims would have been all that was left to his fame (and it was his brother who invented that famous knife).William Barret Travis was the least know of the three and the least acclaimed. As a kid I often wondered who this Travis character was and why was his name mentioned with Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. Travis was a lawyer of limited ability until he fled to Texas to escape his debts back home. There he eventiually found his abilities in the legal profession and he represents that stabelizing effect that professionals bring when they arrive at the frontier settlements. Travis might possibly have exceeded the fame of his two counterparts had it not been for his death at the Alamo. That is because Davis portrays his legal mind as one of a man with great political promise. (Or he could have drifted deeply into obscurity).The details that the author gives us is an excellent study of the emerging American Nation. The explorer, the fortune hunter, and the civilizer were a sort of system that led to the development of the great American continent. Reading the stories of these men gets confusing at times. (I often had trouble figuring out if I was reading about Bowie or Travis since their financial lives were so similar). However, the details leading up to the Alamo gave me a much better appreciation of the actual events. I may not have been as excited about reading of the Battle (as I was in reading Jeff Long's \\"Duel of Eagles\\") but I realized at the end of the book that I had gotten more out of it than any other account of the Alamo. These men (and others such as Sam Houston) were fatally flawed but they were also very interesting. Kudos to Willam C. Davis for putting together such a well-conceived and well-written account."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"William Davis, best known for his excellent works on the American War Between the States (oh, alright, \\"Civil War\\" if you insist) delves into the Texas Revolution with this work, and presents historians with an excellent glimpse at the three principal figures of the Alamo Siege.

I wonder if the administration at the Central Texas school named for Bowie knew at the time what a stinker he really was? Anyway, he was not short on courage, so maybe he was okay to name the school after anyway.The life and times of Davy Crockett written about in the book is also very interesting. His life was as interesting as it was troublesome. His financial ups and downs (even at the peak of his political career) make interesting reading, especially when you learn about his title as author and how his earnings were sometimes tied directly to his ability to make money through his books."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"Davis is meticulous in his research, teasing from the legends what we know, what can be deduced, what is probable, improbable, and impossible.

His logic for rejecting this is astoundingly bad. He says in his footnote that the fact Texans were saying the same thing as the Mexicans a few days after the fight is a reason not to believe it. In other words, he says that because both the Mexicans and Texans agreed about how Crockett died, that makes it less credible!! What? How did he get there. Too bad. This is a pretty good book that seems to be looking for the truth along the way and then at the end couldn't stand to go the final yard and face the fact that David Crockett didn't die fighting but tried to surrender. Everyone on both sides believed this at the time, Pena's firsthand account is very credible and almost every other historian in recent times accepts it except this author. He clings to the idea that no one knows how Crockett died. He's wrong. His death is better documented than anyone at the Alamo. For hundreds of pages Davis fooled me. I thought he was an objective observer. It turns out he's just a Davy Crockett fan. He should have put that coonskin hat back in mothballs before he began this work."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"book looks impressive by its size, but misapplies many of the footnotes. have to be carefull when reading this book. many statements made without proper facts to back them up."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"appears well writtin at frist, but makes many statement without facts to back them up. still I enjoyed the book"},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"An outstanding, if occasionally tedious, book, crammed with detail. It's a long book, too; essentially three biographies rolled into one. I had wanted for quite some time to read a biography of Crockett, which is what led me to this book.It turns out that Crockett was the real thing: a true backwoodsman and accomplished hunter, and an honest and honorable man. He was always dirt poor, but strived to be (and be accepted as) a gentleman. He was a peaceful man, too, not a brawler.He became involved in politics almost immediately after his return from the Creek War, obtaining elected office in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He was a naturally astute politician who knew how to ingratiate himself with a crowd by telling funny stories and displaying his frontiersman wit, but without taking any controversial positions. And, while he was a bona fide backwoodsman, he capitalized on that persona -- in today's parlance, one of the first \\"outside the Beltway\\" types. He also portrayed himself as a reluctant candidate, which he often was at the municipal level. He had a strong sense of honor and prized his reputation. He took offense at the slightest suggestion of any impugning or ridicule of his name, which, of course, made him somewhat vulnerable to political enemies. He had two terms in the Tennessee legislature and three terms in the US Congress (with a failed reelection bid in between his second and third term), with various municipal posts in between and after his last term in Congress.Jim Bowie, on the other hand, was something of a gentlemanly fraud. Part of a large family that participated in his schemes, he ran contraband slaves early in his adult life. He would defraud the Government by smuggling blacks into Louisiana from Texas (which was still part of Mexico), then turn them over to the Government as runaways. Being runaway slaves, but not knowing to whom they belonged, the Government would auction them (perish the thought of freeing them). Bowie would buy them and then get half his bid back as his reward for having turned them in in the first place. He would then turn around and sell them at a profit.His principal vocation, however, was trying to make the big score via land fraud -- forging Spanish land grants and their subsequent conveyance to him of land in Louisiana, then applying to the Government for recognition of his \\"ownership\\" so that he could turn around and sell the land for profit. Most of his land schemes ultimately proved unsuccessful and never provided the big payoff for which he constantly strove. Davis goes into numbing detail on his many land schemes.William Barret Travis was an unsuccessful yuppie of his times, failing in his marriage and his law practice in Alabama. He deserted both for a new start in Texas, having gotten himself into more debt in Alabama than he could handle.All three wound up in Texas for similar reasons. They weren't prospering at home -- Crockett in Tennessee, Bowie in Louisiana, and Travis in Alabama. All three were basically good men -- even Bowie, a product of his times, had many redeeming qualities -- and neither had any shortage of personal courage. Their paths converged, and ended, at the Alamo.The battle of the Alamo occupies about 30 pages towards the end of the book (chapter 21). While interesting, it doesn't provide any new insight as far as I can tell. However, the description of events leading up to the Alamo is an illuminating example of how a lack of discipline in a military force -- in this case, the Texas militia -- among leaders as well as the men, leads to ineffectiveness. Had they been better organized and disciplined, they undoubtedly could have cleared Texas of Mexican troops in October or November of 1835. In the event, it took the appearance of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his main force, along with the heroic example of the Alamo, to motivate Sam Houston's \\"army\\" into becoming a sufficiently effective fighting force. And, arguably, the Texas militia that died at the Alamo had no choice but to tend to their defense as well as they could."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"A brilliant work by one of our finest popular historians. In this case the work is so well documented, with endnotes, that it is worthy of a doctoral thesis. But it is as well written as a novel.

My family and I went across country to visit relatives. Instead of radio, we listened to the kindle read this book. It completely rearranged my itinerary. We couldn't go everywhere, but we lingered in Texas and Arkansas and added Tennessee. The book is so well written and the narrative of the Alamo so well told that everyone in my family was engaged. I understand that the footnotes compliment the tale tenfold, but the stand alone kindle kept a car full entertained.The Alamo is an event, in my mind, on par with the Greeks at Troy and the Spartans at Thermopylea. The men who participated were dynamic American personalities unique to the globe and intertwined to their respective era; to an original America relegated now to mythos and antiquity. Davis's book brings complexity and depth that well encompasses the detail, nuances, and larger themes that erupted at this seemingly insignificant Texas mission. Books like this one insure that the Alamo will always be remembered."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"I have worked at the Alamo in San Antonio for seven years.

It is thoroughly researched, and squelches a lot of misinformation about the three main participants of the battle of the Alamo. And apparently there is no shortage of misinformation to squelch. Some of the other reviews of this book have complained about the extreme amount of information in the book - which leads one to wonder why these reviewers are reading the book about these three men if they don't want to know about them. I personally appreciate the work that went into this volume. I do know the author personally, and the fact is, I don't especially like him. He did me a disservice once, and I remember it well, so I would very much like to slam the book. But the fact is, Three Roads is extremely well researched, and very interesting. If you don't want to know about Bowie, Crockett and Travis, then it's not something you'd want to buy. But if you do want to know about them, this is THE book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis","review":"As a youngster growing up in San Antonio I was fascinated by the Alamo and all the stories surrounding it. I never missed an opportunity to visit it much to my mother's dismay. She knew that anytime we went downtown we would end up at the Alamo.I think this is the most fascinating book on the subjects of Travis, Bowie and Crockett that I have ever read. Anyone who loves history will love this book. It is a great treatment of everything that was going on in Texas at the time and follows the individuals from the beginning of their lives to the end. I think we all forget that heroic individuals are products of their time and location. They are first and foremost human beings with all the foibles that human beings possess. In reading this I was struck by the fact that they are probably not so different from some of our own not so glorious business people of today. How many lawyers, politicians, and big businessmen of today have just as many weaknesses and shady dealings as these men did? They were products of their times and the author does a magnificent job of revealing them as they were. Fantastic and fascinating writing all the way from beginning to end.What is not so fascinating in the Kindle edition is all of the misspelled, non-capitalized words and fragmented sentences requiring the reader to look for the other fragment so that the sentence makes sense. I think for the price charged readers deserve a better reading experience. It started well, but after about three chapters it appeared that either the editor was replaced by someone else, or really got sloppy. That being said, if you love history, and have patience, the book is well worth the read.

Davis seems to have been scrupulous about using only primary sources, and presents a lot of fascinating detail about lives that are frequently mythologized.My only quibble is with the Kindle version, which is loaded with typographical errors. Some are simple mis-spellings which the spell checker should have caught. However, in many instances, the text was garbled to the point of incomprehensibility. The book also refers to several fairly obscure parts of Texas and Louisiana, but the maps were essentially unreadable as reproduced on the Kindle. It was still worth reading, but more trouble than I expected. If you're really interested in this topic, you might want to get the paper version instead."},{"Title":"Guardians: Krilov Continuum","review":"This is the first of two books (so far) about \\"the guardians\\" - a secret organisation of people world wide who limit human technological development - and who are soldiers in a secret war.This book is full of conspiracy theories and human failing. The characters in this book are well developed and they are never swamped by a soap box pet theory of the authors. Instead the secret history we read about is something we all suspect, but instinctivley dis-believe.Written for the Sci-Fi channel, we could only wish that most mini-series had the quality of the story we get in this book, with it's shades of gray.If you like the x-files this is reccomended reading. Adventure with a twist. A shame that the series hasn't been finished yet."},{"Title":"Guardians: Krilov Continuum","review":"When Science Fiction is still Science and Fiction.

Living in the then French village of Vincennes, Alice is all for turning over the city to the Americans. She even helps sew an American flag and brashly climbs to the top of what serves as town hall to plant it.But then those pesky villains, the British army, come and take the city away from the fledgling American presence. Alice just keeps getting in deeper and deeper trouble. First she hides the flag and refuses to surrender it to the British commander. Then she shoots (but doesn't kill) a British officer (who strangely enough goes on to fall in love with her.) She helps her French foster father escape, wounding another British soldier with her sword, which she handles expertly by the way. Enough is enough and the commander finally imprisons Alice and threatens to execute her.Alice's American boyfriend flees to try and find help. He's chased by a band of Indians who want his scalp. He's captured, abused, and forced to go through the gauntlet, but he's able to get away and hook up with the legendary George Rogers Clark and his small band of men.Meanwhile, Alice is told that her boyfriend has been scalped. She attempts to flee her captives and in the course of events she's shot! But don't worry. Through an extreme set of circumstances she survives and is reunited with her boyfriend who still has all his hair.If there's one main nitpick it concerns the character of Father Beret, a Jesuit priest. One moment he's a kind old man trying to guide Alice to Catholicism. But when the situation calls for it, he's a strong defender with a good right punch who can also wield a sword with the best of them. Early in the book he receives a mysterious letter but we the reader never do get to learn what it says. It's obvious Beret has an interesting back story, but author Maurice Thompson never goes into it. A wasted opportunity if you ask me.Another missed opportunity is Alice's background. She was found as a child living with Indians and was placed in the care of a French family. At the very end of the book we're simply told that she finds out who her family is but we're not told how. How did she end up living with the Indians? What happened to her birth parents? Again, Thompson just drops the subject.One last thing: don't expect any politically correct language when it comes to the Native Americans in this book. Keep in mind the era when this book was written."},{"Title":"Shifra Stein's Day Trips from Houston: Getaways Less Than 2 Hours Away","review":"As this was our first time in the USA we wanted to get the most from our trip.

As much as I dislike some of what Roth has written, I can't deny that he's one of the greats in American literature. \\"Letting Go\\" reads as you might expect Roth's first novel to read--that is, it's ambitious, outrageous, and (most of the time) brutally honest. Themes that Roth would go on to expand upon later (Jewish identity, the problems of sex and love and marriage, the desire to find meaning in great works of literature) are evident here in spades. But it also reads like a *first* novel--meaning, Roth was still finding his footing and not without a few fumbles.The book is ambitious, no question--too ambitious, I think. It's as though Roth is trying to consolidate the entire human condition into one novel, which though admirable, is impossible to do. He's grappling with mature themes and questions, but the result is one of dilution. He paints his characters and issues in broad strokes; no particular theme or question gets its full due, despite the book's staggering length. Roth clearly learned his lesson with \\"Letting Go\\"--his subsequent novels were much more pointed and concise.Other drawbacks: the male characters, as is typical of most Roth novels, are drawn far more convincingly than the females, who are too often portrayed as screeching, manic-depressive nags; Roth wanders too often from his narrative course (which accounts for the 630 pages)--for example, the shocking event that transpires in Part 5 is a blatant plot device that screams of insecurity on Roth's part and does nothing to shed light on his characters; and the overall dreariness of the characters and their nihilistic views of life often inspires, not empathy, but eye-rolling.The strongest aspects of \\"Letting Go\\" are the strongest aspects of Roth as a writer: some of the sharpest dialogue out there; some beautifully rendered details and scenes; a genuine seriousness that pervades the work; and a fine portrayal of early-mid-life disenchantment. Most impressive is Roth's ability to show a 1950s America that is about to undergo a radical moral and social change. For a number of reasons, this book reminds me of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" by John Updike; but despite its flaws, I like \\"Letting Go\\" a lot more.This book should have been 200 pages shorter, but that's beside the point. What Roth has done for American literature in the 40 years since \\"Letting Go\\" was published more than makes up for his early fumbles and shortcomings--and, in fact, renders them rather fascinating."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"Don't listen to the negative reviews. I read this book 3 times, the first at age 16. I am now 53. It is my favorite of Roth's work. The fact that he wrote it at age 29 makes it even more remarkable. Make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"This vast novel of urban Jewish academic life in the mid-1950s (first published in 1961) is a dark, brooding meditation on birth, death, family, and the inescapable angst of life. Our \\"hero\\" Gabe Wallach and Paul and Libby Herz, the married couple his life is entwined with, are at first graduate students in literature in Iowa and then young faculty members at the University of Chicago. Gabe reluctantly and bafflingly becomes more and more involved in the depressing and difficult lives of Paul and Libby. In many ways this is an existentialist novel and reflects the basic ideas of existentialism, which was so popular in the 1950s. Gabe, and the others, are constantly faced with choices, some trivial seeming, others momentous, and must confront their freedom and their inability to ground their choices or even understand their choices.Among the momentous choices are Gabe's and Paul's rejection of traditional Jewish religion and life. This is a novel of secular Jewish life and its compromises and difficulties. Gabe's mother has just died, and he is drifting away from his New York dentist father. Paul is Jewish, from Brooklyn, but Libby is a Catholic who converts to Judaism. They met and loved as students at Cornell. Both Paul and Libby are shunned by their families, which leads to tragic consequences.Gabe and his friends are just beginning to explore the leading edges of the Sexual Revolution and are struggling with issues that today seem rather obsolete. Nevertheless these first glimmerings of women's liberation and sexual freedom caused all sorts of turmoil for those in the avant guard. Roth captures the angst, fear, depression, and exhilaration of those exploratory days. In line with the theme of sexual liberation and the existential angst this can cause, the novel is a sensitive examination of the emotional dangers of abortion.The plot of this novel is structured around the motivations and disastrous emotional effects of Paul and Libby's decision to abort Libby's unexpected pregnancy. Thus this novel can be considered to be a warning and alarm about having an abortion without fully realizing how wide and deep can be the consequences. In this way Letting Go is somewhat like John Barth's Sabbatical. Both of these novels, I think, could fairly be called \\"anti-abortion novels\\" but not overbearing, not political--they are sympathetically and complexly anti-abortion.Letting Go by Philip Roth is not for those who want a quick and easy, entertaining read. The book is long, slow and at times agonizing. There are seemingly endless pages of dialogue, dialogue that circles and circles and does not seem to get anywhere. It reminds me of those French art movies of the 1950s and early 60s where the characters just talk and talk and talk. But Roth is such a fine writer, has such a good ear for dialogue, and is able to marshal so many details that this novel, for me, was gripping, absorbing, and troubling. I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s (Jewish, urban, academic) and the reality of this novel is almost frightening, uncanny."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"Your favorite book isn't necessarily the greatest book you've ever read: it's just the one that speaks most directly and resonately for you. This is my all-time favotite, and I've read all of Roth. I love the characters, the structure, even the typeface and lay-out design. I first read this book in its old orange mass-market paperback edition way back in the late 80s, in celebration of my leaving graduate school in order to go write my first novel--a novel, I'll go ahead and admit, influenced sharply by &quot;Goodbye, Columbus,&quot; which I had also recently read and adored--and for the next couple of years, as I toiled away at that novel, I kept picking up my beat-up copy of &quot;Letting Go&quot; and reading it at random, the way people used to read the Bible: I'd stroke the binding, smell the paper, re-read the notes I scribbled in the inside of the jacket. Later, when I was too poor to do so, I shelled out $65 for a mint-condition first edition of the Random House hardcover edition, complete with a flawless book jacket. After my kids and my wife, that's what I'm grabbing when my house catches on fire. I revere Roth as much as I want to argue with him--he's not the greatest confrontational writer of our time for nothing--and yet this one I remove from that great corpus and insert directly into the fabric of my own life."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"I went back and read Goodbye Columbus, then Letting Go on purpose and just loved Letting Go even more the second time around. Roth was showing flashes of his magic with his short stories, but his first novel was masterful. Oh, those poor shiksas ...The second read was better than the first ...."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"_Letting Go_ is not one of my favorite Philip Roth novels. Although quite realistic in its complex approach to male-female relationships, this may account for why I did not quite like it. While I admire Roth's honest approach to inter-faith marriages (a novel set in the 1950s of a Jewish man marrying a Catholic woman), I found the work way too negative and depressing.It became readily apparent that the Paul and Libby Herz union was seemingly doomed to fail. Then again, at least today, about half of the marriages in this country fail, no matter what the religious backgrounds of the couples. Plus Paul, in the early part of his marriage to Libby, encourages her to abort their intended child. This, too, puts a strain on their relationship. Gabe Wallach a/k/a Wallace, a colleague and friend of Paul Herz, falls in love with a divorced woman, Martha Reganhart. She has her own issues related to her ex-spouse and their two children.A large part of the book concerns Paul and Libby's problems related to a possible adoption (much of the issues related to their mixed marriage) and a would be young, rather pathetic, surrogate mother, Theresa, and her money grubbing, thuggish husband, Harry. Gabe becomes deeply involved in paying Harry off to sign a legal admission of his being the father of the Theresa's new-born child. The results are rather funny and scarey at the same time.The author's own experiences with marriage probably account for much of the book's negativity. Plus the book seems to take forever to complete reading. One can tell that _Letting Go_ is Philip Roth's first novel. His later works are more concise and more to the point."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"This is a great way to own Philip Roth's work. The print is good sized; the book quality is also good. I believe Roth is one of the best."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"LETTING GO receives Luke Daniels' fine professional voice adds fire and life to this account, Roth's first full-length novel published just after Goodbye, Columbus when he was twenty-nine. It provides a story of mid-America's changing morals and tells of a newly discharged Korean War vet freed from duty and reeling from his mother's recent death. A fine classic for any audio lending library."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"I've had the pleasure of reading ten of Roth's books, and plan to eventually read all of them, but I must admit to being quite disappointed with _Letting Go_, his first full-length novel._Letting Go_, unlike _Goodbye, Columbus_, and later novels, but like _When She Was Good_, is what can only be described as &quot;self-consciously literary.&quot; Roth downplays the talents he showed in his first book to create a sweeping (too sweeping), long (too long, at 600+ pages, as far as I know his longest book), Jamesian (too Jamesian) novel. Gabe Wallach is a veteran from the Korean War, if memory serves, who in this disjointed narrative undergoes and failes a series of trials of conscience as he tries to help people less fortunate than him. In the end of the book, Gabe finally &quot;goes the distance,&quot; with disastrous results, alienating all his friends... and for those who don't get the &quot;point&quot; of the novel, there's a letter from Gabe at the end which pretty much sums up the entire novel.There are only two interesting characters here: Gabe's father, who has basically a bit part, and Martha, Gabe's erstwhile lover, who is really the backbone of the story. Roth has admitted that his novels are not &quot;plot&quot; novels but &quot;character&quot; novels, and that he specializes in putting his characters in impossible situations. In many of his books, the result is brilliance, but in _Letting Go_ most of the characters are flat, even the central character, Gabe, so it's hard to sympathize with them.I'm led to believe that _Letting Go_ is supposed to be &quot;funny&quot; at points, presumably in the ridiculous climactic scene, but by that time the story had simply gotten on my nerves. The death of Martha's son, and the events leading up to and following it, are particularly bad.The narrative here is disjointed at times, as mentioned earlier. The purpose of switching from first to third person is lost on me, as is the fact that the seven parts of the book have little continuity. Such devices can work sometimes, but they don't in _Letting Go_.This novel isn't all bad. Yes, the characters are flat, but compared to many writers they're positively 3-D, and Roth had already showed an improvement in style compared to his first book. And I can't say I regret reading this book, even while I felt Roth was being &quot;self-consiously literary&quot; and not just doing his own thing, as he would start doing with _Portnoy's Complaint_. Overall, however, avoid this book unless you _must_ read everything Roth has written."},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"The previous review matches my own experience reading the book quite well. For someone who's read a lot of Roth, the book is interesting as a way of seeing him develop his themes - guilt, Jewish identity, etc. But the characters never quite become distinct enough (with the exception of the children and Gabe's father). Still, the book is continually moving in its depiction of the struggle of young adults coping in the mid-50s, trying so hard, it may seem to us now, to be 'adult.' Captures very well a feeling of hopelessness and a trapped quality to so many lives of quiet desperation. I didn't find anything particularly comic about the book, and felt in fact that the book strained for tragic dimensions at times. Maybe I didn't agree with that last review so much after all. I would hate to keep anyone from reading it -- but I wouldn't want to be responsible for sending someone out to buy it. (Given the themes of moral responsibility that the book grapples with, that seems an appropriate note on which to end.)"},{"Title":"Letting Go","review":"I have read &quot;Letting Go&quot; after reading &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and &quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; and I felt bitterly let down by this book. It felt cold, devoid of any real humanity, as opposed to others that I've read. I was expecting fire and life and contradictions and I found lifeless characters and plot lines. It was everything but engaging. I believe Roth was &quot;trying&quot; something new here, a new literary approach, and it failed because it made him move away from his own fictive heart and soul-the deeply personal realm, the contradicting impulses in life, the soaring intelligence faced with the everyday compromises, the devastating sense of humour."},{"Title":"Heavenly Balkans (Argonne House Press chapbooks)","review":"&quot;Dreams are commercials, too./But we don't know what they are pleading for.&quot; Vladimir Levchev, a renowned poet, novelist and editor in his native Bulgaria, proves his mastery of his adopted language in &quot;Heavenly Balkans,&quot; an uncommonly astute and striking chapbook of poems. As an Eastern European poet, Levchev had to learn much more quickly about the reality of history and politics than American poets do, and he demonstrates this in such poems as &quot;The Balkan Dance&quot;: &quot;We are dancing towards a new millennium/and all we can see in our future/is our past.&quot; But he also writes perceptively of America in such poems as &quot;Washington, D.C.,&quot; in which he observes that &quot;Freedom has countless swaying faces,&quot; and in &quot;No Man is an Island,&quot; observing that &quot;We all live in Manhattan&quot; in the aftermath of 9/11. This is a small book--only 40 pages--but the poetry in it is big."},{"Title":"Heavenly Balkans (Argonne House Press chapbooks)","review":"Increbibly engaging and refreshing poetry written by one of the best known Bulgarian poet in his country.

At the time Carson wrote it, it was one of the few books on the Civil Rights Movement that didn't focus on Martin Luther King and SCLC, and as such provided a welcome addition, even corrective, to the mainstream narrative of the movement. It is also a brilliant analysis of the dynamics of a reform movement and the tensions between leader centered and group centered styles of leadership. The analysis of Bob Moses and his approach to grass roots empowerment is right on target and provides a whole new way for thinking about Freedom Summer and organizing in Mississippi. This book is not for the fainthearted--its academic prose is dense at times and details can be a little confusing for those unfamiliar with SNCC personnel, hence four stars and not five. Nonetheless, it's worth taking time with, and I assign this book regularly for upper level directed studies and recommend it to students for research papers. Whether or not SNCC's achievements were compromised by the antics of former members in the 80s and 90s, Carson's book is a great analysis of its formation, tactics, and dissolution."},{"Title":"In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"This book is a great account of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, which was started in 1960 in regard to Segregation on Americas buses and in the Woolworth dining room. This book leaves out no account, and anyone who had anything to do with the movement and SNCC is mentioned in this book. Carson went all out, and I think this book should be required reading in every Civil Rights History course."},{"Title":"In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"In Struggle recounts the progression of the SNCC from its early days of assimilationism and conventional middle class values, through its radical and militant period, its separatist and provocative period, and then back again into conventionalism and low-level activism. Many SNCC members during its radical period, debated whether the victim should become the executioner. Instead, the victim becomes part of the system, such as Marion Barry's accession to the mayor's office in Washington, D.C. And the idealism of the movement went out the window as well, when in the 1990s much more mundane pursuits took over Barry's life, including crack cocaine and prostitutes. One reason for the winding-down of the SNCC may stem from the conditions that spawned it. Under an oppressive system of the Jim Crow South, the SNCC had a common enemy to fight, and clear goals to achieve. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act had been passed, and subsequent advances were made at the legislative level, the goals and mission became less clear and less defined. Now that so much had been achieved, the SNCC began to fight amongst itself as each faction attempted to secure ever smaller slices of the revolutionary pie. The cautious liberalism of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations proved fatal to the more ambitious fervor of the SNCC; the legislation acted almost as a safety valve, relieving the pressure that had encouraged the formation of the SNCC. SNCC students were, in their heyday, overcompensating for all the resentment they had from being historically marginalized and held down. SNCC members had discovered their voice and used it passionately, but once people started listening to them, SNCC found itself in the position of not knowing what to say."},{"Title":"Roy Gardner: My Story - Hellcatraz","review":"Roy Gardner was at Alcatraz for the two years of Alcatraz' history about which we know the least.

It not only places all the fad diets (Adkins, South Beach, Zone, etc.) in context, it gives you principles on how to choose good food and bad foods in each food class (carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, drinks, etc.) It also explains why exercise makes a difference---(muscle burns more calories at rest than fat tissue)--In short it gives you principles of healthy eating based on scientific evidence by which you can lose weight rather than \\"a diet\\" you may or may not keep."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Those looking for a magic cure for weight loss, keep looking because there is none. If you want some sensible advice and delicious, healthy recipes, this book has that. I will not be able to follow the 21-day diet to the letter of the law because I work outside my home and can't do all of the meal preparation, etc., but just the simple advice to exercise at least 30 minutes a day has meant more muscle definition in a short period of time. The recipes I've made have been delicious and healthy (Madras vegetable curry, 3-bean chili, roasted tomatoes).I feel compelled to respond to some of the reviews, especially the bizzare complaint that the recipes are \\"not vegetarian.\\" There are a number of vegetarian recipes (including the 3 I just mentioned) and the authors also suggest using vegetable stock instead of the standard chicken stock in recipes. Maybe the person meant the recipes are not solely vegetarian? Also, someone complained that the 9-point plan is \\"full of obvious things we already knew.\\" I wonder how much that person exercises on a daily basis. It's one thing to know you should be doing something and it's another thing to feel motivated enough to actually do it.

Therefore, I feel confident that this book provides a true lifestyle change versus a passing weight loss fad. Since I've had the book for 4 months, I was ready for some new recipes.

Easy to prepare and quite delicious.The authors give you the option of making small changes or larger changes - whatever works for you.I especially like the mix and match approach of the diet plan. You can have a different breakfast (lunch or dinner) everyday or you can eat the same thing everyday if you want.

The problem with this book, however, is the research itself, the Nurses' Health Study. The most famous study on women's health, it suffers from a serious flaw. The diet followed by the women in the study is high in animal based protein; in short, they follow a typical American diet. Epidemiological studies on diet around the world show that high consumption of animal products is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and autoimmune diseases. These diseases are far more common in the US and other \\"developed\\" countries than in parts of the world where people eat a diet based on whole, plant-based foods with very low levels of animal protein and fat. The women in the Nurses' Health Study who consumed the least fat ate 20-25% of their calories as fat; those in countries with the lowest level of dietary-related diseases typically eat 10-15% fat or even less. Therefore, if you follow the recommendations that come out of the Nurses' Health Study you will still be at increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and other diseases of \\"dietary excess\\".I have other objections to this book, besides this essential flaw. It seems to combine the latest diet fads (the GI diet, essential fatty acids, phytonutrients) with outdated advice. It perpetuates the myth that vegetarians and vegans need to take extra care to consume enough protein and to make sure that that protein is \\"complete\\" -- in fact, the notion of incomplete proteins has been shown to be wrong, and anyone consuming adequate calories will inevitably consume enough protein. They encourage taking calcium supplements to avoid osteoporosis, stating that \\"a high consumption of dairy products is probably not the best source [of calcium]\\", but they don't explain why (excess dietary protein causes calcium leaching from the bones). And most ridiculously, while admitting that tap water is generally just as good for you, they come out with new age mumbo-jumbo about drinking overpriced bottled water: \\"...manufacturers have created a whole industry around the psychological power of the bottle, and you can tap into that power, too.\\" That's right, companies have brainwashed us into thinking that bottled water is better, so we might as pretend to believe it!If you want to take a small step towards a more healthy diet, this book might be a good place to start. But if you want optimum health throughout your life, and as an additional bonus to lose excess weight and not have to worry about regaining it, then read books by authors such as John McDougall, T. Colin Campbell, and Caldwell Esselstyn, who are at the forefront of the most groundbreaking research into the connection between the Western diet and the illnesses that plague us."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Great book for basic information.

The advice is sound and healthy, and does not cut anything out. This truly is a lifestyle plan even more than a diet. The idea of adding in healthy choices to eventually overtake the unhealthy ones is psychologically much better than feeling totally restricted. This book is truly based on science and health studies, and by no means is it a fad diet. The body score quiz keeps you mindful of what you are eating, as well as your habits. This is the first time I have looked forward to starting a \\"diet\\", and have truly believed it is one that I could stay on and adapt as needed. The Portable Plan is a great companian, as there is a fair amount of cooking on the 21 day plan. The message of the book is so positive - every little bit of good eating and exercise helps.I cannot say yet whether it works or not. I started the 21 day diet yesterday, and so far it is great. Willett could not have chosen a better person to work with on the book. Katzen's recipes are delicious and simple. I have looked forward to and utterly enjoyed all of the recipes. I know I am eating healthfully and nutritiously. This is the book I have been waiting for my whole life!** Update: While it takes a lot of work to follow the 21 day diet to the letter because there is a lot of cooking involved, if you are able to do it, you will not be disappointed. The meals are DELICIOUS and very well planned. There is so much food, you will be shocked to see what happens to your body.I quickly became leaner and I have had an amazing amount of energy. Granted, each person is different, but for me, my body started to change immediately even when the scale hadn't shown much change. The actual pounds may not drop off like on more of a fad diet, but I have been so happy on this plan and I and others see and feel the results. Learn to adapt it to suit your needs and it will work for you as a long-term approach to eating. Best of luck to all!**"},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Just finished reading this book and am looking forward to putting it into my life. The \\"Nine Turning Points\\" provide straightforward guidelines to follow generally, the \\"Body Score\\" gives a good way to track progress and stay accountable (something I liked about WeightWatchers points), and the multiple plans allow you to adapt the guidelines to an ever-changing life. I appreciated the positive character of the book- focusing on adding into your diet and being positive about food rather than stressing the negatives and things you need to deprive yourself of. Some of the smaller tips about HOW to eat your meals (slowing down, savoring them) sounded trite in the beginning but actually have made a difference. Finally, I love the recipes. I think following the 21 Day Plan for me to a tee will not be possible, but the book gives you ways to substitute on days when you don't have time for the recipes and give good ideas on how to use the same cooking session to benefit a few meals. A few of the meals are a little too out there for me, but I was pleasantly suprised at how many of them I actually looked forward to trying (many more than when I look through an average health food cookbook, even one of Katzen's). There's also a great little guide about how to shop for certain items (yogurt, bread, cereal, etc.) that helps you make the best choices in these areas.Overall, a really great book-- would definitely recommend it for those looking to improve their health in a longterm way."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Walter Willet is the head of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard and author of 'Eat, Drink , and Be Healthy'. He opens the book with a personal preface explaining his family connection with good food, and farming. He then tells about his professional career and his participation in Dr. Frank Speizer's 'Nurses Health Study' enabled him to better understand the principles of proper nutrition.His collaborator Molly Katzen author of the 'Moosewood Cook Book' is a specialist in preparing and providing healthy vegetable rich meals. Her job in the book is to provide the recipes which will be in tune with the principles Dr. Willett elaborates.These principles they label nine turning points. 1) Eat Lots of Vegetables and Fruits 2) Say Yes to Good Fats 3) Upgrade your carbohydrates 4) Choose healthy proteins 5)Stay hydrated 6) Drink Alcohol in moderation (optional) 7)Take a multavitamin every day 8)Move more 9) Eat mindfully all day long.They also provide a method for assessing your 'body-score' of keeping tabs on how you are doing, and improving it. They also provide three different food regimens, each for a different purpose. A warm-up plan to get people going into proper eating, a twenty- one day more rapid weight- loss diet, and a long- term maintenance plan.Part three of the book contains the recipes, and Part Four is what they call a Tool Kit, a shopping guide, and a guide on how to eat well through life's ups and downs.It is hard for me to believe that most readers would know all the information and insight provided in this book. i.e. I think there must be something valuable for all ' conscious eaters' even if the very knowledgeable.I am not a big maven on this subject but I have taken an interest in it for years. Nonetheless I learned many things from this book. Why of all vegetables one of my great favorites 'potatoes' is not recommended for a diet. Why the whole wheat grains and rices are truly preferable to the white- stuff as they slow down digestion and absorption. Why cooked tomatoes are a valuable ingredient in the diet. Why the best diet is not a fat- free but rather one which makes use of the 'healthy kind of fat'. Why tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring providing Omega -3 are so important for our health. Why and how conscious eating can make for a truly improved feeling about oneself and one's life.This is a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Great basic information about healthy eating with truly readable \\"Science Bites\\" that should cut through the hype and assumptions and misinformation once and for all. I especially appreciate the friendly voice (Katzen, always accessible) and the flexibility in the eating plans. There isn't just one plan here. There aren't just two plans, either. There are, like, 4 or 5 of them, ranging from cooking a lot of your food from scratch (don't freak out. It's pretty straightforward) to buying your food out of convenience stores when on the run or traveling. And much in between, including how to eat out and enjoy it without going off the rails. And these plans are interchangeable, so it fits into real life. You don't have to cook, but you can. You can stick with just a few of the meals if you prefer, to keep it simple. You can eat nuts and chocolate and fruit. You can drink wine. You can have your favorite treat (M & M's, even!! but you have to count them). And exercising doesn't have to be a big commitment. All in all, this is for real people with complicated lives who love food and don't want to get into weird eating trips to lose weight. I predict this solid book will still be on shelves 10+ years from now."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"I was spurred to write this upon reading the review by Suzi from Honolulu, right after hearing an interview with Mollie Katzen about this new book on the radio. I thought it would be clarifying to point out that Ms. Katzen specifically geared the recipes in the excellent \\"Eat, Drink & Weigh Less\\" to beginning cooks, and/or not-particularly-foodies. She actually explained this in some detail in the interview - that many people are not used to whole grains, and vegetable dishes, and that not knowing about these types of food and worry that they are too complicated and time-consuming is a main deterrent for many people to eating healthily. I also do some free-lance food writing, and I know how tricky it can be to figure out what level of experience to address in writing recipes. Ms. Katzen talked about wanting to make these recipes more welcoming to people who've never cooked from her books before, or have rarely cooked at all. There's always someone feeling disappointed if a recipe is either too complicated, or too simple (although I've never heard anyone complain about the latter). Just thought I would point that out. I myself was relieved to see the recipes be so straightforward, and it gives me hope that more people will turn to the bulgur or roasted cauliflower (or butternut squash) or very easy single-serving soups that Ms. Katzen shows here. So I see the simplicity of these recipes as as a very cordial and user-friendly element.Maybe at some point, she will follow this up with an entire cookbook of weight loss recipes! I would look forward to that. In the meantime, I am impressed with the very usable tools this book provides, and I hope and believe that many people will find realistic life-changingkeys to getting slim in the encouraging flexibility of the plans, accessibility (to beginners and experienced cooks equally - all of whom are time-pressed) and real-world science information presented here.

I feel nourished and satisfied and have successfully started to lose weight. More importantly, my family is eating more fruits and vegetables than ever before. My six year old son has eaten almost everything he has tried and my very picky four year old daughter has sampled (although not relished) some foods she had previously never considered trying. I don't feel hungry and often times I am shocked by the huge amount of food on my plate when I sit down for a meal.The fact that eating this way is very time consuming is the only thing stopping me from giving the book 5 stars. I do consider myself a foodie and I like fruits and veggies, but I never realized how much I fall back on processed food on nights that I get home late from work, or don't feel like cooking. Since being on the 21-day eating plan, I feel like I am always in the kitchen, either preparing the evening meal or getting things ready for the next day. Not to mention the clean up! I think it will become easier as I learn more shortcuts, and Ms. Katzen does try to give hints to make prep and clean up quicker, but I seem to have much less free time since I have been on the eating plan.Overall, even with the extensive amount of food preparation, I believe this plan works.

There is a two page questionaire that you fill out every day to see how many \\"points\\" you get - the more points, the better towards your goal of losing weight - this is nice, because it forces you to look at your behavior every day and set specific goals towards change. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"As a public health researcher, I am always interested in what Dr. Walter Willett has to say about diet and healthy eating. His recommendations are based on research, not on fad or fashion. Now, teamed with Mollie Katzen of \\"Moosewood\\" fame, Willett has created a workable plan for helping Americans not only lose weight, but eat a healthier diet. My husband and I have tried out the 21-day plan for the last 3 weeks, and we are losing weight and we are not starving in the least! The recipes are excellent, most of them taking only a short time to prepare. One has to be committed to stick with this eating plan, but the results are very worthwhile. Congratulations to Willett and to Katzen for a job well done!"},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"I LOVE this book!!!The book presents a combination of sound science presented in an accessible way with delicious recipes and snacking suggestions, plus, it is easy to read.Over the past 20 years I've explored a wide variety of non-fad diets. I've come to be a believer in a flexible diet that works with my personal lifestyle and changing needs--this plan allows you to do that. Over all, I think it presents a realistic, easy, and non-judgemental approach to food and health (and, of course, weight loss) and highly recommend it not just for those that want to lose weight but far anyone who wants to better understand how to fuel thier body and enjoy their diet."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","review":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less provides sound advice about nutrition, the importance of exercise, and improving health. Dr. Willett does an excellent job explaining the key components of dieting. The book, also, has well planned meals that are laid out for 21 days. However, the real reason I bought the book was for the diet recipes by Ms. Katzen. When I first read the reviews, I heard about long recipes that required time and commitment. The recipes, however, can be made in a very short time and require very few ingredients. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Although the recipes are not bad, they are missing her usual pizzazz. A few are worth consideration such as the Spinach with Pine Nuts and Raisins, Broiled Eggplant Parmesan, and Honey-Broiled Pears, but overall I would have been happier with the lengthy, complicated, interesting recipes the first reviews alluded to."},{"Title":"American Rhetorical Discourse, Third Edition","review":"I purchased this book for Com 115 and Hist 201 learning community.

As a scientist, Young has lived in a world of discovering Nature's secrets. His extensive interest and research into the Bible, Lexicon and many other tomes dealing with religion and the hereafter launch the reader on a voyage of a new perspective in dealing with the concept of 'Heaven'. This book should be read by anyone who has ever pondered about the many conflicts found in the Bible and the Bibles' influence on much of the world's peoples. I consider it recommended reading for anyone who has an interest in the world's religions and their influence on the equality of women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is a wonderful book that tells the story of 4 girls who are living during the Civil war and trying to cope with their father away at war and their mother who is busy trying to make ends meet until their father returns.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It started out that I just wanted to get more AR points than this other girl in my class who had been unable to finish the book because she had thought it was so boring. I was anticipating the worse, but I began to read it and I just fell in love with the dear little book. It was just so great! My favorite character by far was Jo. After I read it more people in my class became curious and four other people in the class read it including the first girl who gave up on it.

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book.

I decided to re-read it and I am glad I did. So much fiction today is lacking in plot, character development, and thought, in short, this is good literature. This is one of the best books around for people of all ages. I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it. So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it.

Since it had been so many years (about 30) and I was getting ready to readMarchby Geraldine Brooks, I wanted to go back and re-read this first novel.As many other reviewers have said, this story starts off quite slowly and I was initially disappointed. It wasn't the book I remembered. Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.I wonder how young girls react to this now when \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Gossip Girl\\" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this. The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit.

The novel concerns the lives and loves of four sisters growing up during the American Civil War. Beautiful Meg, tomboy Jo, serene Beth, and selfish Amy are based on Alcott's own experiences with her three sisters.Little Women has such a sweet feel to it. The characters are all so real, each with their own personalities that jump off the page. They make you care deeply about what happens to them. It's lovely to see how they struggle with their own and each other's flaws.Little women is overall a wonderful classic.

This book will pull at your heart strings. A different time/era. But it is easy to relate to. It reminds us to embrace our families, be strong in our ups and downs. Step back and view complicated relationships and remember somehow it all works out."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Where did you get this edition of Little women? It was filled with grammatical errors. Reading your book really was a bizarre experience. Have one of you editors read this edition."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Nothing is better than free! Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie. I had put off reading it since I was very young but had always wondered at the hype of this book. It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again. I would recommend it to my daughters for it's message, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends as recreational reading."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I remember watching the movie when I was younger, and had the movie in my head the whole time I was reading... waiting for all the climaxes of the book. I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter to part of a set for her birthday.

I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I like this book because of Jo March. And I never cry when Beth dies, because she annoys me."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was thrilled to find Little Woman for free on Kindle. I remember reading this book over and over again when I was a child. I believe the version I read back then (many years ago) was slightly different from this one. There are scenes in the Kindle version I don't remember from my childhood. Of course, it could just be a faulty memory on my part. Either way, this is a wonderful book for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You can never go wrong with the classics. My daughter (11) loved this book adn so did I when I was a girl"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"it is a really nice novel. it is so good that i wish i could read it more. it was like i was witnessing the whole story myself . it was a really nice experiance. we can learn so much from it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just finished reading this book and I liked it a lot. The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic. Recorded Books always uses excellent narrators, and Barbara Caruso is no exception.Now if I could only get my hands on audio versions of Little Men and Jo's Boys, so I could once again enjoy those favorites, also...."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this book for my girls and we all love it!!Hours of good reading.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that).

When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other.

Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars. I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach.

I felt that I was giving permission to live the experience of being a March. The story touches me in so many ways. I first recieved this book when I was only twelve and since then I read it at least once a year. It a book that every little girl in the world should read and even every little boy.

I liked the romance in the story, and how there was a little sadness in the book as well. This book was also definately worth reading even though it was long. The text in the story was extremely descriptive and the whole plot of the story is definately #1 for a lot of the books that I have read. It was a book that was hard to put down, with all the struggles and problems the characters overcame in it.

Although I was only 8 years old when I read, and are ten now, I believe that I fully do understand what the book is about.

Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Have you ever had the life of poverty?Having your father away in the Civil War not knowing when he'll back?Or waking up on Christmas morning not having any presents?Well, you soon know how it feels in the great book Little Women.

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments.

Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

These four girls&iexcl; weaving story touches my heart deeply. Laurie, a charming young man, has an unusually sincere love for Jo, yet marries her sister Amy in the end. This scenario gives me another answer about the love and deep affection. John, who is Meg&iexcl;s husband, and Friedrich, who is Jo&iexcl;s husband, helps the story becomes more exciting.

The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read.

First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself.

It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.

Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read !

They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters? Read Little Women and get into the story. I think the best rating for this book is four and a half stars. It needed a little more happiness towards the end.

All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Great classic read.

It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Okay, so I know it published in 2 parts. This book all to books together. P.S. watch the movie after.

One of those stories you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a timeless story of four sisters and their lives as they grow into adulthood.

The book is like a whirl-pool that you can't get out of. You feel like you are part of the March family and cry when the cry, laugh when they laugh, etc. etc. The movie on the other hand was ok, but wasn't nearly half as good as the book.

The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Hi I;m Amanda.

Beth struggles from a disease and is usually not well, so her family must care for her when she is in need.

So I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer.

A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a really great book! If you haven't read it yet, READ IT TODAY!!! It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!? Log off, shut down and read!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Don't panic the reading flows easily after the first couple of pages.

We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today.

The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"AS ALWAYS IT WAS A THRILL READING LITTLE WOMEN, IT'S TIMELESS.

The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult.

Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In the senior class of the &quot;Great Books&quot; program at the college I attended, one of the weekly speakers asked how many of the women had read Little Women.

I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a book for all ages.

It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner.

It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is a very interesting, realistic story.

I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War. Add one loving mother, Marmee, the boy next door, Laurie, his tutor, John Brooke, and Friedrich Baher, a German professor and you have the best book of all time!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war.

The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book. I enjoyed the book alot."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY! My wonderful mother read this to me and my brothers and sisters and we thought it was SUPERB!!!! This is an excellent price too!

There is a lot of love through out this book. You will meet in the beginning four young ladies and get to see what it was like for them to grow up during the war. While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister. I love this book because it shows love and pasion within this one little family of five. If you enjoy reading Little Women, two other books also written by Louisa May Alcott are, Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"the book little women by Louisa May Alcott was a great read and i thought the writing style was very easy to read it kept you interested through out the whole book. i recommend this book to anyone with alittle sense of how young girls are and how they are when they are growning up and even some of the hardships that young girls go through."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was a significantly written book with strong character relationships and character personalities. The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play. They all soon become good friends. However, being in the time that are, things go to terribly wrong . . .Little Woman is a wonderful book. I believe that everone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"And so begins one of the most enduring and endearing stories' for the very own &quot;little women&quot; inside us...my favourite book of all time, I read it when I was 13 and have read it hundereds of times since and each read brings with it a new perspective-a new understanding of the important things in life...family and the value of friendship... an unfogetable classic."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Five stars? More like infinity! I have read this book only four times-but already I know I have found my kindred spirit in this wonderful story! Lovely Meg is the eldest of the four March sisters, tomboy Jo is next. Then comes timid Beth, following is the last-but certainly not least-flirtatious Amy. I love all four sisters and have a bit of each of them in me, though most of me is Jo. I LOVE THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT TO ALL!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a story by the 4 March sisters who battle the challenges of life together.

This book takes you through the obstacles and adventures four young sisters face, it summarizes the strength and spirit that comes from a powerful bond of love. As you read the book you will feel the pain and happiness that the sisters go through. The book teaches you wonderful lessons as you read through it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A book of happiness and sadness, ups and down of our lives. This a light-hearted story, however Beth's death makes it a really sad story. Any one who read it once will want to read it many many times more."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You will not believe the feeling you will get after you read this book. It leaves you surprised and amazed at what these four young ladies went through. You will feel their pain, their happiness, as well as their tears. It isn't easy when you're father is away at war, but these four strong ladies were able to manage and get through all those tough times and still try to make the best of it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A brilliant book of true lives. Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read.

A good balance between superfluous writing and practical observation of women in that era. I enjoy Little Women both for the natural and whimsical natures of the girls and have always been a fan of their funny personalities, especially Jo and Amy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this classic when I was a kid. Now my kids have all read it.

Interestingly, I enjoyed many of the lessons regarding growing up and marriage that I feel still ring true in our current times."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love this cute book. I haven't made it through yet, but a classic in my mind! Reading is good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When I started reading this to my children, I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike. The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women.

For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate. I really like this book because it gives me a look into how girls lives were when this book was written. Little Women is about the March family and their trials while Mr. March is at war. There are four girls Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy who expirence growing up in a society where you are judged by how much money you have. Eventhough they may be down on their luck they still manage to keep on giving to others that's what I really like about Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book was really good. It tells you how you should do things thing when you grow up. It is a romantic love story between 3 girls, who are named Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Beth dies, in the middle of the book.

First of all i Loved this book! I would recomend this book to absolutly anyone!!!!!!!! Keep reading :)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love \\"Little Women\\" by L.M. Alcott. It's a great book. Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago.

We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Despite the Jessie Wilcox Smith illustrations on the front and back covers, I was very disappointed to discover that the artist's color plates that so perfectly capture the characters and events in this American literary classic, were omitted from this edition. Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee.

Marmee teaches them values that will result in happiness for each of them.The values would make them happy throughout their lives. The most important lesson Marmee teaches her daughters is love,and how to overcome their hardships.They achieved these things by through God, and the love of each other.Meg was the oldest at age sixteen.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task.

I recieved mine new from a seller."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i read books called little women in my school library and i thought the were sieres so there must be a lot of different versions i cant wait to read this even though im only 11 i heared great things about this book and i loved the ones i read in the library i just love to read and i love old books i think its cool to learn that really thats acatally how people lived then and then there were these lucky ones it toght mehow unfair life was and sometimes still is"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I inherited my mother's copy of \\"Little Women\\" when I was young, but always had a bit of trouble reading it. It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading.

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber!

When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have been wanting to read LITTLE WOMEN since I was in BYE BYE BIRDIE in high school because of an allusion made to the book by Rosie Alvarez and Albert Peterson. However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN.

In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead.

She becomes well but it weekend her heart forever. At Christmas time the family buys Beth a brand new piano. Before Beth's sickness, Meg gets married. When Jo sets out to New York to publish her books, she falls in love and rushes home when Beth is sick again, what will happen to Beth?"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women, is a literature genius when it comes to this book! Meg, who is sweet and shy, is also the oldest, Jo is a tomboy but also has a gentle heart, Beth, who is very down to earth and ends up with a undeserved ending, and Amy, who learns that she is selfish and does change her ways, are all the most wonderful sisters and characters anyone could hope for in a classic like this! I rate this book 4 stars because it shows the trials and tribulations of yankee sisters during wartime!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy. The characters Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo, were happy because they had each other. They always talked, spent time with each other, and believed in God.Its pretty cool that even if they were poor they enjoyed them selves.They went to parties and traveled.They did what ever any oyher girl could do.Each girl had a specal thing about them. Meg was the oldest. She had soft brown hair,and was pretty.Jo was a tomboy. The only thing nice about her was her hair."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and on a vacation, and for my lil brain at that age it was great, but now it's just a little too simple that the children always try to do the right thing no matter what, always do as their mother tells them to, and always end up learning something wonderful. For the young reader, read it! If you're older and you want to read a children's story, read it! but if you want to read a book that seems realistic, don't"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really did no t find this book interesting. I like James bond more. I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband. I just can't get behind that."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was a very good transaction.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood.

I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried.

She think it's so dreadful to be poor."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book first some twenty years ago. It was our high-school text book. I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do. I think you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"EVERYBODY has to read this book. It's like the best book in the world.

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose. (as funny as that sounds) You'll fall in love with Jo's oddities just as much as with Beth's gentil manners. It is a great book that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was so, so looking forward to reading \\"Little Women\\" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age. I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned. It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N; discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (\\"Aunt March Settles the Question\\"). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \\"home copy\\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Please don't misunderstand me...I am NOT disparaging the original story of Little Women. The one star rating is for this particular edition of the book. I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one. An UNABRIDGED copy!! This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!!

Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just recieved this treasured book from my childhood along with Little Men and Jo's Boys and now I am in the Christmas spirit.

I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Not sure what I can add that other previous reviewers haven't already added except to say I liked it too!

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

It touched me. Read this book, I say, everyone! And I know that this isn't a very thorough review, but reviews are for opinions, and that's my opinion..."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The heartwarming story Little Women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters growing up in New England in the 1800's during the Civil War. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel. Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas and dreams of painting in Paris. Alcott portrays the characters that make them come to life as you read and the thrill you have that lures you into reading more and more. This book leads you to realize what family love is."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters coming of age during the Civil War. Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Do not purchase this eBook if you are looking for Little Women - find an official, authentic version instead."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"MY SYNOPSIS:The Marchs are the picture of a happy home: with conscientious and righteous Father, who is serving the Union cause as a chaplain, and wise and generous Marmee, who watches over her girls with love and care. Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it!

Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends.

It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total.

It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls.

Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves.

Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book, it is one of my very favorites. It's a million times better than the movie! I loved how Louisa included so much about \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" Throughout the book I found countless truths and beauties that I shall always remember. Loved it! :)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is easy to read and takes me back in history. Even if it is fiction. I would recomend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women, always a classic. If you are young and have never read this book, it is highly suggested. The classics are classics for a reason.Good movie too!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a classic written by Louisa May Alcott about four sisters and their mother during the Civil war. I have loved this book since I was in 4th grade and continue to love it now.....I won't say how many years later. It's a great read, great descriptions of the morals and manners of the area. I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I hadn't read Little Women since I was in middle school so it was nice reading it as adult. I was planning a trip to Concord, MA so I wanted to read it prior to touring the actual Alcott house. I think I enjoyed it so much because of the combination of seeing the historic house and my perspective as an adult. It is a solid classic American story and if you have never read it, you should."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A timeless book that is sure to please every little girl and some boys too.

I was a little surprised to see how small the actual copy was as the copy I had years ago was very thick and bulky. When I got my replacement copy, I was a bit worried the full story would be missing and very surprised and pleased to find it was the full story in a smaller, easier to hold book. I would like to find the copies of Little Men and Jo's Boys in the same format if possible."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book was good and the professional narration that came with it made the book all the better. Ive read it before but this was the best time yet."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a true classic!

I have enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I like it so far. Should have fine shed the book before I saw the movie. The movie has a very young Liz Taylor. I do recommend the book by L.M.A."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book was a little slow to capture my attention at first, but I was soon captivated by the story. As the reader is taken through the journey of each of the girls lives, they are introduced to valuable lessons. It is a lovely and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about. I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The characters , you got to feel like you really got to know each one of them and you could feel the love between them like every family should be but which very few families really are.

Saw the movie many years ago, but the book took the story so much more in depth.Really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical.

The style varies from a slow meditatve pace to a rapid sequence of events. It would have been nice to have the small pictures that were included in the original version and in pdf form for free somewhere else.

I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that. It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up. Such a shame that novelists today are discouraged to use such language. It is easy enough to read and I would imagine it would be a great one to read to young girls piecemeal on holidays. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A truly heart warming story.

Every one in the world would love it, but if you don\`t like it your crazy and need to love it with all your heart and respect."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a (boring) fiction book about the four March Girls- Meg, Amy, Jo and Beth, who I can never tell apart. They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again? BORING!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"its a great classic novel that teaches many morals and values in the life of a family. it might have a long exposition which you have to patiently wait to get over with. an all age book"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this book! It was sometimes happy, sometimes sad, just like real life. I recommend this book to people who like realistic and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As always a great story. I haven't read my kindle version yet because as bad as I wanted to own a kindle I am having trouble reading from an electronic device instead of a real book. But it was delivered immediately"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I would have never picked up this book had it not been assigned in one of my college classes. I was not too excited about having to take this 'American Culture' class, and on top of it being assigned to read this lame book, Little Women. Oh, but how wrong and narrow-minded I was, as this turned out to be my all-time favorite book! We were only assigned to read the first part, but I loved it so much I let my other classes slide to read part two. If you're not too sure about this book, throw your doubt out the window and read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I consider the book Little Women a five star book because it is a well educational story of 4 young ladies that grow up to be women. They learned how to be women by taking care of themselves when there mother left to go help there father since he got sick while fighting in World War 2. Beth got scarlet fever. She was very sick and they sent a telegram to the mother. The mother came home and Beth got better. A few days later the Mr. Lawerence boy brought home a sepcial surpirse...the father. He came home just in time before Beth got sick again. Soon after she died. Amy went off to Europe with her Aunt March and Mr.Lawerence and the boy Mr.Lawerence were there. The boy fell in love with Amy. They soon got married.When they came home everyone was surprised. It was a great celebration. Meg was married,then Amy was married, then Jo was soon to be married. They all celebrated and lived happily ever after."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Meg Jo Beth and Amy could be alive today They are the kind of people you care what happens to them and though some of the values are old fashioned the girls were probably modern for their day"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. I like the TV show &quot;Little Men&quot; so my mom suggested I read the &quot;beginning of the story.&quot; I was reluctant at first, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! I like how all of the 4 sisters were close to eachother. Amy really got on my nerves because she was so snobby and ladylike, but all of the other characters were interesting. It is definitely one I'll read again."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER. You'd strip away all the justice of Alcott's classic by watching the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is by far the most compelling book of the century. This book shows the struggles and hardships of four girls and the people around them. Throughout the book, there are many difficult situation that the girls have to overcome. If you haven't read this book, you really should because it redefines our modern day concepts of family life and love."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Many people think diferently from me about the point the author wanted to put across in her writing. I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read! It is a tear-jerker but at the same time it a laugh-out -loud great book. What is everyone waiting for ? Get up and read this great book!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm not usually the type of person who likes to read, but when I started reading &quot;Little Women&quot;, I could not stop. I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person. I recomend this book to any woman, young or old, for the chronicles of the March family are not just a story, but a lesson in the true meaning of life;love."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was introduced to LITTLE WOMEN at the age of 12 or 13. I have read it scores of times since and loved it unceasingly. I have cried with the March sisters, shared their joys, their tragedies, rejoiced in their triumphs, and laughed at their mishaps.

And then I want to say to aaman or whatever your name is, come on. Really? Did you have to write TWO reviews on how bad this book was?

I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read. Do not think for a moment of not reading it, because it is such a heart-warming tale of one beautiful family and how we can all triumph no matter our circumstances and achieve happiness. Love, love, love this book!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I also read this book as a child and re-read it as an adult, finding it just as magical, tender and great as I did back then.

It is definitely worth it reading all 444 pages. Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would love to read a story about this strong family. The author, Louisa May Alcott, is very talented."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this many times as a child and am enjoying it all over again.

Could have done without some of the long winded plays early on."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

This edition only goes up to the chapter titled \\"Aunt March Settles the Question.\\" This is because this is the Chrysalis, which is a UK company.

Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story. However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included.

I first picked it up about a year ago in a bookstore when |I was bored, which pretty unusual because I can usually always find something to read.It was the name that caught my eye. I had read a biography of Louisa May Alcott in a Social Studies textbook, and I knew about this book. But I had never read it.It was a small, thick copy in Scholastic Classics Edition. I opened it and the first sentence got mee hooked, about how tomboyish, bookworm Jo March wishes she had presents for Christmas.And then, I read on and on. I learned about grownup, sweet Meg, shy and music-loving Beth, and artistic, pretty Amy. 'But of course I had to leave that bookstore. But my very nice aunt bought the book for me.In that edition the book was 560 pages long, and I finished it in less than three days.This terrific book of love, laughter, friendship, and family is sure to charm everyone who takes the time and patience to read its thick volume. But, believe me, it's WORTH IT!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read.

While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses! Such variety! In this book are triumphs and failures, love and loss. Overall an astounding book - I would read it again in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best.

It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The words are so crowded. So I won't suggest this one."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"After reading Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre, both written in the 1800s and which I loved, I thought I'd try another classic, Little Women. What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war. Genre: young adult fiction."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have just re-read \\"Little Women\\" and found it even more intriguing then the first time I read it as a preteen.

I finally did one day when I saw it on my friend's bookshelf and asked to borrow it (to which, of course, she agreed; we exchange books as often as we exchange words). I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping. It's about life and growing up and everyone on the planet should read it!Now I hope I've made my point; I have to go to the library now to get Little Men."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely.

Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies? Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's declaration of love for her? This book is a masterpiece. It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up.

I was read to this book when I was very young, but only did I understand it's full meaning until reading it again recently. This is a classic book that is not to be missed.

None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are.

Them living in poverty being angry about not having all of the things that they wnat, and them doing good for others by giving them their Christmas breakfast. Sisters will always argue, but they learned to love each other in spite of the things that made them mad. Each of them had something that they had a passion for and they loved each others work. They all loved to read the stories that Jowrote, and tey loved to hear about all of the parties that Meg attended, and listen to the music that Beth played, and Admire the pictures that Amy drew.

Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel.

I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge.

At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered.

Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo.

There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages).

I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day.

Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older...

Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages.

But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i love this game keeps you busy on a rainy day. love to play games and stay busy . ."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I AM SORRY , I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK AST YET.

Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read.

The binding is beautiful as well."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them? Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full. The interesting theme is love, I would recommend this book to children ages, 12 and up and I would also recommend the book to young adults, because the book is very enjoying."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Wouldn't it be fun to live in the early 1900's?

I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters.

The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself.

Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives. Not something I usually think about after finishing a story. Beautiful book and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story is about 4 sisters living in the mid 1800, somewhere near Washington, Philly, or NY. It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I like this book alot.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores.

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships. I rate the book 4 and 1/2 stars, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to all the men out there that shy away from &quot;women's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens.

I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book.

As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now.

It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy.

Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less.

I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009. (zero)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I haven't read this book &amp; probably should. I started to in grade school and got bored after 2 pages. Anyway, I watched the movie recently and was very confused. It was a pretty good story and apparently autobiographical, but can someone who is hip on this story answer some questions. e-mail me at msbeckaru@aol.com1) Who is Marmee? The sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, &amp; Amy as best as I could tell. Does the mom have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names? They didn't say in the movie. 4) Who's the old lady who leaves Jo the poodle and the house? Is she a relative?Thanks."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story is so incredibly melodramatic it's not even funny. Jo is such an unlikeable character. She's arrogant, fickle, and a complete drama queen. I was frustrated the whole time I read this book. I was hoping that there would at least be a good ending to this story, but the ending was the worst part of it. So Disappointing."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"They sent me a copy of Little Women, but a COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT EDITION from what I ordered. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. They said that that was the edition they had on hand, so they sent it out!!They thought I wouldn't notice. I ordered a pocket edition and they sent me a large book, and a large print one at that!!!I would give them NO stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition.

I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is my all time favourite book.It is the heartwarming story of a family during the American Civil War.It describes the joys &amp; sorrows of four girls belonging to the March family &amp; follows their journey through life.As a child it was their personal stories that fascinated me, but as an adult I appreciate the authentic potrayal of the turbulent times that were the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I recommend this book, Little Women for not only child but adult.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Don't get me wrong.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics.

Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic.

The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Bought this book for my friend, who recently became a 4th grade teacher, to keep in her classroom for her students to read.

The reviewers who were looking for \\"something special\\" for Little Women will find it in the Borders version. The book is almost as beautiful as the story. The Penguin Classics version is just plain ugly."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought one marked as 'like new' but disappointed when got it.At a glance, everyone knows it is kind of old because of scratches."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't add much that hasn't been shared in other reviews. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott introduce us to four remarkable characters: sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March. Alcott wrote the first volume in two and a half months. That blows me away. The two volumes have been combined as one since 1880. Read Wikipedia for more information, especially the \\"Autobiographical Context\\" that shares information about Ralph W. Emerson."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It was great to find the book I needed quickly and for a great price as always.

I bought this copy because I wanted a nice, hardbound version and I liked the illustrations."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book month ago. I love it. Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers. If you like to knew about Louisa May Alcott, you should read this book, Jo acted a lot like Louisa May herself. I like is book very much it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this book but after reading it I didn't realize it had two parts ( Good Wives is the second) and bought the second book. So if you read it you will love it but be carefull!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is such a long book, it would have been nice if there were a table of contents included with this version. But if you're not picky about that, this is a great free version of the book, I'd recommend it vice paying money for another edition. I very much enjoyed re-reading a novel that was so much part of my childhood."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am ten years old and I read Little Women when I was eight or nine years old and I read it again recently and I think its a wonderful classic."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book was excellent.

Even though the time period is way back when, it kept me interested."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was little. I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family. I laughed at Jo's antics, and cried at Beth's departure. I really think this book has encouraged me to be a genuinely better person. I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness. This is definitely a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love this book and the charming characters in it. The book is about girls growing up to be Little Women, and there journeys and lessons on the way. It's a great book but in a little to much detail for my opinion, but it was an old book and still is."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book touched my heart.

A must read for young girls. I could not believe that it was free from Kindle. Worth so much more."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I got this book for free so I just read it to see what it was about. I am surprised to say Little Women is actually a very addicting book. All of the characters are fun to follow. The second group of stories are stronger than the first, but overall this is a great read."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own. Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've been reading on this book for some time; truth be told, I actually started reading this book about forty-five years ago! I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good. Genuinely inspiring people in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this book. I found a lot of life lessons in it. I had such an easy time reading it on my Kindle, especially during my sleepless nights before having my baby."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I remember opening up this book one day when I was in a particularly melancholy mood. After reading a few chapters of this book, however, I found my heart warmed to its very core.I cannot even count the amount of times I shed tears while reading this book.

The connection between the girls and their mother is tender.&lt;Little Women> is...A captivating little novel that makes one remember that there are things more dear on this earth than money, fame, and other worldly things.A story of four magnificent young girls who go through sorrow, joy, suffering, and happiness to grow to be great women, all wonderful in their own way.Louisa May Alcott's way with words makes one adore the American language, as Alcott uses her words to paint the best picture of the welcoming home of the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Very good book.

Reading it was a life altering experience. I remember reading parts of it to my mother in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today.

Even after first reading it 15 years or re-reading it, I still cry when Beth dies, laugh when the sisters write and star in their own plays and pull for Jo as she makes a way for herself in a man's world. If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price.

The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship.

The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston.

I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect description.

Set in New England, the story captures the essence of sisterhood and finding things to occupy the time in days when there was little money or entertainment provided.Written by Louisa May Alcott, the story retells the childhood of Alcott and the ways that strong family values helped hold the family together during tough times. The story tells of how the family followed the transcendentalist theories which emphasized always perfecting oneself. The girls all struggle to find their place in the world and their own personal perfections throughout life.Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy all struggle with where the days of childhood end and the days of being a Woman begin. Each girl tries to discover her calling and her gifts that she will present to the world. Whether an artist, a writer, or whatever life calls them to be, each of them have dreams of growing up and making their mark on life and the world.The family seems to overcome all obstacles handed to them.

It touches the hearts of all who have ever loved, lost, struggled, and overcome obstacles in life."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women, in my opinion, is the best book ever written. It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before. I recommend this book to everyone who likes classics. Also all women who have sisters will really appreciate the trials that these four have."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read. This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women. Their triumphs will bring a smile to your face, while their trials will bring you tears. The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott.This book is an amazing book. It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not. But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When i was nine years old i read little Women. Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises. Even when sometimes the surprises seem out of place, everything comes out perfect.Anyway, it has a very nice ending, and I loved reading it even though it was very long."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I thought the book was rather good.

Then ending was really cute too."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I actually liked the book Little Women. I am not huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book. It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views. This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is one of the BEST books I have ever read.

In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting. But overall I think it is worth reading for its messages, plus it's free on the Kindle so I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Ms. Alcott presents a charming mixture of realistic children's behavior and idealistic moral lessons.

I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children.

I first read this book when I was 8 years old (I'm now 68) and I fell in love with all the characters. I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!) On the other hand, the story is so heart-warming and charming, I soon was able to overlook the fact it was written more than 150 years ago.

Her sentences are breathtaking and every character is charming. I feel like I've learned something at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott.

Even though I struggled through some parts I still think that it is a great book."},{"Title":"Traditions in Architecture: Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania","review":"Although the book was written as a textbook for a course in non-western traditions in architectural history, it may be of considerable interest to anyone traveling to parts of Asia, Africa and Oceania. The authors' approach is largely descriptive, and the illustrations both plentiful and very good, so one may be a little impatient that the verbal descriptions rarely provide much information that is not apparent from the photos and drawings; but this is, after all, a textbook, and if you will grant that allowance, it is well-worth your time.The architectural traditions covered are contemporary as well as ancient, grand as well as domestic and, throughout, the authors treat the sacred and symbolic traditions of the culture, insofar as they are known or may be inferred, as they bear on the built environment. The book is organized thematically, rather than chronologically or geographically. Among the themes: moveable, stationary and underground dwellings; the impact of colonialism on native structures; the transfer of traditional architectural knowledge; and spatial organization, from courtyards to the axial alignments of cities. The focus is on three categories of structures: professionally designed and built monuments, houses erected by traditional building tradesmen, and structures that ordinary people build for their own use. The overarching theme is that architecture expresses cultural values as well as technology, and it illustrates that theme with an exceptionally wide range of examples.In the single area of the book where I have a fairly solid background, the Anasazi/Puebloan architecture of the Southwest, the scholarship is current and sound. Interesting and highly informative."},{"Title":"Traditions in Architecture: Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania","review":"My familiarity with architectural studies stems from 3 years as a graduate student. Most architectural studies are \\"biased\\" to western history and organized in chronological order. Traditions in Architecture takes a fresh approach by focusing on a rich source of architectural precedence in the early America, Asia, Africa and the far east. The organization is thematic, rather than chronological covering such diverse topics as fixed versus mobile living spaces, vernacular materials, construction methods, sacred spaces, and so much more.The only reason that I did not give the work 5 stars is that many of the pictures (all black and white) lacked clarity. I do not know whether this was due to poor originals or poor reproduction; however, the details often are necessary to understand the full impact of the works.As UCLA professors, Crouch and Johnson give much credit to their students' work and input. This appears to be a work that has been a culmination of years of study with much independent input. I highly recommend it as a \\"first\\" to take this approach and to cover such a wide breadth of topics in one volume."},{"Title":"Lucia Rising","review":"For me, there is nothing quite like E.F. Benson's 'Lucia' series, except perhaps for the novels of the great Jane Austen herself. Benson is truly a social satirist of Austen's calibre (and I give this praise as an absolute Worshipper of Austen, so it's not lightly given). Benson's characters, living, as they do, lives of comfort &amp; ease in quiet, picturesque English villages, during a historical period of relative peace, manage to get up to the most exciting and riveting, but at the same time, completely polite and respectable social adventures, and display to the reader their own little vanities and self-deceits in the most wonderful ways. I think I'm on my third reading of the books now (having acquired them about 5 years ago) and I still enjoy them immensely. I can't imagine any fan of Jane Austen not also totally 'getting' Benson's Lucia &amp; Miss Mapp books. Benson rocks!!"},{"Title":"Lucia Rising","review":"Lucia Rising is not a novel in itself; it's the compilation of the first three Lucia novels. The second compilation (novels 4 - 6) is called Lucia Victrix. Maybe I'm a dope; it took me a while to figure this out!My grandmother and mother have always raved about \\"the Lucia novels\\" and reread them again and again. Naturally, I was curious!Rather than Austen, I'd compare these to a very gentle version of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves novels. Same time period, same class system, same loony characters. I found that I devoured the first three, but trying to read all six in succession? It began to get a little overwhelming...For one thing, Lucia and Mapp, the principal characters, are simply not nice people. Yes, their endless schemes to best each other are amusing, but after hundreds and hundreds of pages their actual characters are no more developed than they were in the first chapters.Having said this, it's an authentic picture of a time and place, and I found myself wishing I could spend an evening with these people (not much more!)"},{"Title":"Lucia Rising","review":"Just a word of warning: is is not a new original book in the Mapp and Lucia series, but a compliation of three of the books (Miss Mapp. Queen Lucia and Lucia in London). As much as I love these books, I was a little disappointed that is was not another book in the series, especially as I already had the books contained within. However, I rate these books as 5* for anyone who does not already have the novel in question."},{"Title":"Letters to Philip: on how to treat a woman","review":"Letters to Philip was an excellent book. I don't just recommend this book for men, but also for women. When I read the book, I learned so much about how my future husband needs to act. He needs to share his emotions, show that he cares about me and my feelings, show that he is willing to compromise and show that he loves me. This book tells all the ways that he should treat me. This book also shows all the ways that he should not treat me.Every chapter is a letter to Philip from his dad giving him lessons on how to be the best husband he can be. The book explains women's feelings and thoughts completely. After reading this book, I decided to have my boyfriend read it. I want to be treated right and respected by the man I love. Men who want to honor the Lord will treat a woman the way she should be treated. All women should look for men with godly characteristics, so I encourage everyone to go out and buy this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Philip: on how to treat a woman","review":"My husband received this book as a young man and it greatly influenced his approach to relationships. He has always recommended it to his friends and now to our own son as a wonderful resource for practical and sage advice on how to know when you've found someone you could love for a lifetime and how to keep that love going strong through thick and thin. It's worked for our marriage for 17 years, we highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to make their relationships better and stronger."},{"Title":"Letters to Philip: on how to treat a woman","review":"I actually purchased this book for my son.

But, the woman's voice is a little too soft and it grates my nerves a little. I like the message and stories, but the story teller could use a different voice."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this CD. My kids were used to Annie de narrator from The Indigo Dreams, garden of wellness CD, that when they heard this CD they asked me to \\"go back to Annie\\". My 6 year who has some minor sensory issues, is scared by the voice of the narrator....he complains that the music scares him too.My 4 year old daughter doesn't mind but prefers her friend Annie.I want it to buy more of these CDs but i want to make sure, this time, that I get something my kids feels confortable with.

They used to listen to it every night to go to bed and it really helped to get them in bed at their actual bedtime. It's been a while now and they go to sleep just fine without it most of the time. But every once in a while on a night they're not feeling well or a little anxious about going to bed we put the CD on (it hasn't left the CD player since we bought it)! It's a good CD and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Bought this for my grandchildren to introduce them to meditation.

She would start screaming and crying as soon as we put her in the crib, saying not to put her in the crib and that she couldn't fall asleep. This CD played an intricate (if not most important) role in getting to to sleep at a reasonable time. I would turn it on during her bedtime routine (when we changed her diaper, while brushing her teeth, and even while reading stoy books). The woman's voice and back ground music are incredibly soothing and set up an environment of calm that really got her ready for bed. Then when it is finally bedtime, I make sure there's still 3 or 4 stories left so that she can have something to listen to for a while to help her drift off to sleep. She listens to this CD every night and never cries to go to bed. Even if she seems not that tired, she'll hang out in her crib with some books and I think it's the CD that eventually puts her in a relaxed, sleepy state that allows her to fall asleep. She sleeps 12-13 hours a night, and doesn't wake up in the night either.I was afraid she would tire of this CD so I bought two other music/lullaby CD's. I have not even had to open them up. It's perfect to help a wound up kid who can't settle down not be stressed out about bedtime. Going to bed went from being a total nightmare (no pun intended), to a relaxing and happy time. We have this CD to thank!Honestly I think if I had issues falling asleep it would help me too!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"We all enjoyed this relaxation cd which I would play for my children for a few weeks before they would go to bed.

She is now 11 in 6th grade and it still is a comfort for her. She has minor anxiety issues and developed a ocd, picking her eye lashes and brows. We thought she was ADD which we still think but also anxiety as a co-morbid condition. This CD she loves and gets her restless mind to sleep very quickly. She still listens to it at night. Im surprised she isnt sick of it. I would highly recommend this CD to help destress and relax your child."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My 7 year old has a very hard time slowing his mind down and falling asleep.

Why? I'm a school social worker who work with all kinds of kids who have various issues like ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Asperger's Syndrome and cognitive impairments and this little treasure has been helpful in all cases. I've used it in classrooms to do group meditation and visualization and I've used it with individual students to decrease anxiety, hyperactivity and opposition. Who could listen to this and NOT feel relaxed? The woman who narrates has a wonderfully soothing voice at just the right tempo. Use it often to have the desired affect."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My son was having all kinds of anxiety about sleeping in his own bed and even when he did sleep there he would get up in the middle of the night and play video games. It's a bit upsetting to find your 4 year old up at 2 AM on the computer afraid to go to sleep. He was afraid of the dreams he might have. Anyway, this CD has calmed his anxiety. We put it on and have the CD repeat all night. He is asleep within 10 min. and doesn't get out of bed till morning."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I am a school psychologist and use this CD in my \\"worry classes\\". I use it with children who are experiencing anxiety as well as for children on the autism spectrum. The children ask and look forward to using it as a part of each session. Through the easy to follow stories, the children have learned relaxation techniques which they have carried over to home and bed time. they always leave the sessions calmer and ready to go back to class for learning. Some of the children have had their parents buy the CD for them. I would highly recommend this series for children who are experiencing anxiety but also just for healthy relaxation."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Indigo Dreams is an amazing children's sleep CD. We bought this for our 3 yr. old daughter who is simply \\"on the go\\" from sun-up to sun-down. On the first night that I played Indigo Dreams for her, she put up a fight and asked me to turn it off. In no time, she was fast asleep and the last thing she muttered was actually a quote from the CD. Indigo Dreams has quickly become part of her bedtime routine--she asks for it every night after we read books. Truly a great relaxation tool for youngsters.."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I ordered this cd after reading the reviews, as my 6 year old twins were having trouble falling asleep. One of them was having a lot of anxiety as well, including irrational fears. We played a different track of the cd each night for about a week. At first the boys wiggled around, giggled and would not settled down. By about the 3rd night, they were getting into it and relaxing. They would go limp with relaxation as we listened to it in the dark. Our favorite track is the Good night caterpillar, which is followed by very relaxing music. The kids have fallen asleep so much easier than before. I even used the good night caterpillar in the middle of the night when one of the boys had a nightmare and was upset and agitated. He was able to fall right back asleep, without the usual requests to sleep in our bed.My son with the anxiety problem has gotten much better. He no longer has worries about school or spiders, two things he used to obsess about. These CDs were worth their weight in gold as far as I'm concerned. We are all sleeping much better. We have only had these about a month and their has been such a significant improvement that we don't need to use them all the time. I think the kids are learning how to relax on their own. If your kids are struggling with sleeplessness or anxiety, don't hesitate to give these a try."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"For my child, who has had sleep issues forever, and had alot of success with Indigo Dream: Garden of Wellness, this CD was disappointing.

I am a psychotherapist and wanted to try something different. My son had an interesting reaction to it while he was stressed out-he thought it was, \\"too slow\\" and \\"boring\\" and wanted me to turn it off BUT: after a couple of minutes he said, \\"Mom, why do I feel so sleepy?\\" (!). I did too. It is soothing and on their level and I thought that it was relaxing. I only played it a that one time however, because he objected to it another time and fortunately, I have not really needed it.

I placed a special order for this book at our local bookstore,and was it ever worth it. My son could relate to the bear and this useful tool became an aid for him in school and any other time he needed to breath like the Bear (Dr. appointments were very successful when having to breath in and out like the bear) I then ordered 3 of your Cd's online. Indigo Dreams, Indigo Ocean dreams and Garden of Wellness. My son has been listening to these CD's each night as he falls asleep for the past 5 years.My son is now 9.The other night my son wanted to blow up an air mattress in his room so that he and I and our dog could all have a sleep over movie party in his room. When the movie was done he asked me \\"Mamma, do you mind listening to Angry Octopus?\\" (he listens to this each night at bed time and is what he calls the CD)So as we laid there listening to the Cd and Angry Octopus story- he followed each step by step instruction for breathing and holding.I was shocked, amazed and had tears of joy in my eyes at this. I always just assumed that he listened to them adn enjoyed the calming voice tell each story but never knew he actually followed along with the CD. It was then that I truly realized how much he was really getting out of these Cd's. I then asked him \\"Do you always follow along with the CD and instructions when you listen to it?\\" He replied that yes he does unless he falls asleep. Haha!I have to say to you Lori: THANK YOU! Thank you so much for doing what you do. Thank you for creating these stories. From the bottom of my heart thank you!

I was hopeful that it would be useful, but since I know I am quite critical of relaxation/imagery CDs given my expertise as an art therapist, psychologist, hypnotherapist who creates imagery, and conducts relaxation training, I didn't expect to be as impressed as I was. Not only did kids like it, but wanted to listen to it over and over again for entertainment. Even siblings who were not the intended audience enjoyed and requested it. My kids liked the stories loved the details and expressiveness of the characters. I found the voice tone good, and the content of the metaphors remarkably cohesive.

It is beautifully done, with a direct approach to the child. So many materials in this area become sweet, almost sickly sweet, but Indigo Dreams is warm, charming, and really loving, while presenting the techniques in an intriguing and creative way. There are four selections on this CD, in addition to the complete sound track. The first is also called \\"Indigo Dreams\\" and is a series of affirmations, accompanied by gentle music. It is especially appropriate for younger children. \\"Boy and a Bear\\" deals with easy breathing, \\"Boy and a Turtle\\" uses colors, and \\"The Goodnight Caterpillar\\" considers Stress and Release, and Progressive Relaxation. Here, the child is used as a teacher, which can be a very positive experience for some children. This CD gets my highest recommendation.Lise Liepmann, MA, MEd, School Psychologist and Play Therapist"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My child, diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, has always had difficulty falling asleep despite all the bedtime rituals we would follow. His mind would just stay so busy when he was supposed to be relaxing and falling asleep. The Indigo Dreams CD and companion books have been a great help. He is able to concentrate on his breathing and relaxing his mind and body. He falls asleep much more readily. The CD is beautifully narrated and he really enjoys the music too. This is definitely a help for stressed out parents."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"We bought this for our 8 year old daughter who tends to be somewhat anxious at night trying to get to sleep.Since receiving this CD she looks forward to bedtime and she goes to sleep very easily. Bedtime is now a very positive experience for her.My wife and I were searching for a long time for something to help her with bedtime and this is the answer. Even if she happens to wake up in the middle of the night, she'll just put the CD on again and it really relaxes her. We have also recently received Lori Lite's other CD \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" variety, and it is wonderful as well!By the way, my son who is 11 also loves both CDs (and to be honest they have put my wife and I to sleep when we've had it on).Thanks to Lori Lite for helping out all the parents out there who were looking for a way to help their children with what can be a very anxious time for many kids.I can't recommend this enough, the stories are fabulous and are read by the author who has a perfect, soothing and calming voice. The music is very soothing and meditative as well and compliments everything beautifully!Also, for those whose children are in their teens, Lori Lite just released a new CD called Indigo Teen Dreams. It uses the same techniques but is presented in a way that is more suitable for kids in their teen years."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My 4 1/2 year old loves to listen to this CD at bedtime. We thought that he would be too young to appreciate it, but he asks for it every night at bedtime. He really enjoys the stories and we love the fact that it helps him get to sleep and promotes his self worth!!I would highly recommend this CD to any parent."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I never take time to do these reviews as I am toobusy. But this one deserves my time.My son (5) is a bit on the anxious side due to somesurgeries, a very active mind/tense body, and quitesimply due to his personality. I have tried to teachhim breathing techniques and a small amount ofmeditation- he didn't really learn them all that well.However he LOVES both the Indigo Dreams cds forkids and learned the breathing techniquesimmediately. I was surprised to hear him say oneday out of the blue \\"MOM! On the cd there's onecalled \\"Bubble Ride\\" and you can feel the bubblescascading all the way down to your fingertips and itREALLY makes me relax!\\"He won't go to sleep without them now. Heassociates it with relaxation and sleep so all I haveto do is turn on the cd player and he immediatelycloses his eyes and gets down to the business ofrelaxing towards sleep. Before the cds, he would beup and down in his room for up to an hour beforehe would settle down and stay in bed.My neighbors 10 yr old daughter is very anxiousdue to a break-in in their new home recently andsome other issues she has. I suggested this cdawhile ago but her mother didn't buy it. Finally afterthey had yet another sleepless night due to somebad night terrors and were exhausted, I walkeddown and physically handed one of our cds to themso they would try it. She said her daughter lovesthem and zonks right out. I never did hear if theyhave \\"cured\\" her of the night terrors and anxietybut I do know they bought their own copies thenext day!It's a good thing too because my son was literallycrying to get his Indigo Ocean Dreams copy backone night (he had the other one - Indigo Dreamsthough!) and I had to walk down to their house inthe dark and trade them for our Indigo Dreamscopy!The woman's voice is so soothing. It'swonderful. I love to listen to it too. The pace isperfect also. Thank you so much for these cds.Children have so much to deal with in their littlelives and it's wonderful to see someone payingattention to this and teaching them thesetechniques they can learn easily and use for the restof their lives! Thank you Thank you!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Our children finally have a product to empower them to deal with anxiety and stress. My children have been exposed to violence on the television, been bullied in school and are under a tremendous amount of stress. My younger child gets teased for being overweight. I don't remember being this stressed out at their age, but I'm stressed out now dealing with their stress.A friend introduced me to Indigo Dreams CD and my children LOVE this CD. They want to listen to the stories every night. In a short time they have learned to use the techniques that Lori Lite teaches to help them in their everyday lives.My youngest loves the affirmations, while my older one adores the breathing and The Goodnight Caterpillar story. I was forced to buy another CD to avoid the fighting.I highly recommend this CD and the stories."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Because I create guided meditation CDs for adults I have researched and reviewed literally hundreds of similar products, and I have to say, the Indigo Dreams series is one of the best. This CD was so relaxing I had to re-start it three times to get through the whole thing -- I was trying to stay awake but kept falling asleep! The techniques are straight-forward relaxation processes, but woven creativly into the stories. The next time I need a present for a 4-to-8-year-old (or maybe even a kid-at-heart!) this will be my choice."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"After having a wonderful experience with \\"A Boy And A Bear\\", I decided to try \\"Indigo Dreams\\". I was not disappointed. My grandson and I sat on the couch and together we enjoyed the gentle, relaxing stories of Lori Lite. I wish other grandparents (as well as any adult) could be made aware of the value and benefits that is available to them by simply listening to these stories. Thank you Lori."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I was a little afraid that my two boys, ages 7 and 8 when I got them the CD eight months ago, might find Indigo Dreams a bit childish. No worries. They love listening to it and play it every night as they go to sleep. They seem to recognize that it helps them. In fact, if we continue to talk after I have started the CD, they ask me to start it over so they can hear it from the beginning.The boys have been through a painful divorce, their father's immediate remarriage, and are now living in two extremely different and antagonistic households - switching back and forth every other week. The older of the two boys used to lay awake for an hour or two after bedtime but now goes to sleep quickly and easily. The younger used to be plagued by nightmares but those too have all but disappeared.Although I didn't realize it at the time, buying this CD was a gift of simple, peaceful comfort for my boys - helping them to cope in a world that has gotten too complex for adults much less children."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My seven year old has enjoyed the stories very much. The stories are a creative way to introduce children to meditation, positive thinking, affirmations, breathing and relaxation. I hope other children will be able to use this unique CD. I am a Montessori teacher and I will use it in my classroom. I just odered Indigo Ocean Dreams and we can't wait to get it! I am so happy that we have Indigo Dreams."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I have been teaching for many years. I recently had the opportunity to observe a class of first grade children as they listened to these stories. Wow!! What an amazing transformation. They came into the room very excited and within minutes they began to really listen to the stories,relax and follow along with the directions. I watched a boy I knew to be extremely hyper become very calm and quiet.This collection of stories is what we all need to help us manage our day to day stress. I highly recommend this CD to all parents with children and who knows they might enjoy the stories themselves."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"The Indigo Dreams products are just what kids today need. With the world being so different now and everything being so fast and chaotic much of the time, Indigo Dreams is a way to slow our lives down and be more mindful of what our children need from moment to moment. I highly recommend this to every parent. We have no problem buying toys, DVDs, and other media that over stimulate our children, but we forget to help them wind down and relax from life. Indigo Dreams is the perfect tool to help parents help their children slow down, relax, and destress. Thank you so much, Lori and Rick!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Very pleased...My Daughter has a few disorders and she finds this CD ( Indigo Dreams), very helpful. Had some worry it may be too young for certain children, but my Daughter is 9 and loves it. I think behind safe doors at home, children yearn to still be children and not grow up as fast as society pushes them too. So enjoying stories that seem a bit too young, usually are not. The relaxation techniques from this cd are what is most important..It really works!!! She tries to stay awake to hear all of the stories, but can not...Also the first night, she said she had a much better sleep through the night. By the way, she suffers from anxiety disorder, sensory processing disorder, post traumic stress disorder and a couple more..So we are very greatful to Lori and Family etc for their wonderful talents, knowledge, work and caring.Here is what my Daughter said in a message to Lori Lite:\\"Dear Miss Lori and Family, Thank you so much, you are so kind. I loved all the stories a lot. they relax me. I heard you gave a talk for spd and that is one thing I have. That is great that you are helping kids and us kids with disorders too, because many people dont get our disorders and they get mad at us. You make me smile. I really appreciate your help.

I was able to listen to 30 second sound track samples at their on-line site mentioned in another review - [...]. What I learned from visiting that site is that this CD, \\"Indigo Dreams\\" is taped using a female voice, the CD \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" also mentioned by others in this reivew, is taped using a male voice, and at the site it notes: \\"Designed as the sequel to Indigo Dreams, this CD offers longer stories and expands on the relaxation techniques of breathing, visualizations, muscular relaxation and affirmations.

I even fall asleep sometimes before them."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My son has a lot of anxiety at night and has trouble falling asleep. The narrator's voice was creepy and weird and the sound quality was not very good--a lot of echo. One of the first stories is about a spider and a snake...not exactly comforting, cute images for a child trying to fall asleep and afraid. I'm surprised at the number of good reviews this got, but to each his own. If it helps, great, but it had the opposite effect on my son. As an adult, I found nothing soothing about the narrator's voice, either. Any message of affirmation she was trying to convey was lost in the delivery. Instead, we're going to try a CD of classical music with birds in the background. Much more sweet, calming, soothing, and lovely to sleep to."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I wish I had read the 1 ratings before purchasing this item, but it was so highly rated I bought it without hesitation. It was a complete waste of money. I listened to it and thought, \\"This isn't very relaxing,\\" but didn't say a word. I then played it for my 7 year old daughter after she took a bath and crawled into bed, and she immediately crinkled up her nose and said, \\"weird!\\" Then she laughed at the ridiculous thought of listening to it. It was creepy and weird, and she gets spooked easily, scared of \\"monsters under the bed,\\" etc, so I immediately stopped the CD because I can imagine such a creepy voice could inspire nightmares and fear.I then played the Indigo Ocean Dreams for kids age 6 and up and although it is also weird - the first story is about an \\"angry octopus,\\" the voice is better and my daughter was willing to listen to it. However, I would not recommend either one.If you get this, do not play it for your child alone. Stay with your child and listen together."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"A little bit more new agey than I would like, and also I tend to prefer great messages like these only presented in a more subtle manner.

They said the voices \\"creeped them out\\". So, we're back to Kenny Loggins. I passed it down to our girls, ages 3 and 5, and they both requested not to have it play again, since they didn't like the voices. Maybe they are just used to the CD's they already have, I have no idea. I thought the CD was fine, but my kids all hated it, so it didn't improve or manage stress in our house, that's for sure :o)"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"The narrator for the stories has a pleasant voice and does a great job making the characters in the story come alive without over doing it. Her voice is like warm nectar dripping, smooth and steady. It completely envelops you in a web of comfort.The pace is slower than I normally keep and when we first began listening to the stories it took a couple of tries before my 8 year old would settle. Now, by the time we are on the second story he's usually asleep.The only reason I don't give it a higher rating is that there are only 4 short stories on the CD and I'm not sure they will pacify my son much longer as he thinks they are baby stories. There are 5 tracks, but 4 stories that are very short. Maybe if there were a variety of more content included, it would work better for us."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"This CD has been invaluable in getting my daughter to sleep.

They say things like \\"Oh, that's a good idea.\\" I highly recommend this CD series.

In the last few weeks my children have now started asking at lunchtime for the stories they want to hear...their favorite The Boy and the Turtle..I love the voice and tone..I find it very soothing and calming..I really think that's what my children love most about it..I watch them try and immitate the bear and his breathing techniques in the story The Boy and the Bear.

After a shower and books, it has become a regular part of our nighttime routine. The four stories teach children to give themselves positive messages, breathe deeply, and relax the muscles in their body.

A wonderful, relaxing way for children to let go and fall asleep."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"We tried for years without success to get our daughter to consent to trying relaxation techniques. She tends to be anxious and tense and has difficulty relaxing enough to fall asleep. In addition to that, she has a sleep disorder.I find the overall quality of this CD's narration slightly lacking, but that doesn't bother my daughter at all.My daughter, age 10, loved this CD from the very first night. She plays it every night when going to bed and also sometimes plays it to help herself calm down. She has never wanted to have a human being help her relax; somehow that makes her feel too vulnerable. The CD is different from having another person there trying to help her calm down. It's non-threatening and soothing. She has had a huge reduction in the length of time she requires to fall asleep. She used to stay awake for at least half an hour, but now she can fall asleep in minutes. The CD doesn't get her to dreamland that fast every single night, but the improvement is dramatic and very much appreciated!!!Regarding the review stating that the reviewer's children found the CD disturbing--I think it is a matter of personal preference. I think that very, very few kids would have that reaction to it.I find this product to be a very worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"This CD is amazing!

Since he is already sensitive, the voices actually made him a little more anxious and this idea of my flopped. I think this is an excellent CD, but one has to guage the purpose of use and the timing. I think, for my son, this would be a good day time activity and not an evening activity. I might suggest if one is not sure, to take a book on tape/cd that is age appropriate and see how they respond to a bedtime CD first. Since my son was not used to someone else reading/talking...this seemed to distract him more. I would give the production and professionalism high marks...but downgrade more as a way to make others aware of its limitations.

I bought it for my challenging son who has a difficult time settling down at night. The voices on it are so calming, very consistent, and gentle. It is on a level that a child understands and a willing adult will appreciate. I found it very easy to let myself go in the CD. My DH and DS have yet to make it through all the stories without falling asleep. Funny, DH thinks it doesn't help him relax much. My son does prefer the books, because he has learned we can slow down and he can create and modify the story to suit his mood (sometimes it's pretty finny!). I recommend this CD for those interested in learning/teaching meditation to your children. The stories are very validating and good for building self esteem, especially if you discuss the character attributes your child has in the way the material is presented. The child will eventually find a way to see him/herself in the story. It would very good for those who do not have any experience with meditation as you will learn what kind of voice works well and be able to take it from there."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I purchased this CD for my four year old son just a few weeks after he was diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes.

This CD has helped her so much! She used to listen to quiet music but she had a hard transitioning from being up/reading books to laying still and listening to music so she would often roll around and talk to herself and get herself wound up. We tried stories on tape but she would stay awake and listen to the whole story and then still be awake! This is the perfect combination. The short stories at the beginning (I think 5 stories about 5 minutes each) are active enough that she listens to them rather than plays. They are active in that they talk to her and ask her to participate but the talk is about relaxation--the snake learns to hold his body still, the turtle takes deep breaths--so they encourage her to lie still and relax while still feeling involved in the story. Quiet music plays after the stories. I have yet to peek on her and find her awake even 5 or 10 minutes into the music--a huge improvement for this child!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My little boy loves this CD!

I bought the Sea Otter cove book, but that didn't help. The CD was better because it was someone else telling the story and we could listen to it together. I could show her how to do the breathing and we can try it together. I think she might be a little young to understand or perhaps focus on the exercises, but she does listen the the story and is able to settle down. the 5th track of just music for about 20minutes is they key for her. that's really when she quiets down and starts to fall asleep.

I thought it would help my three and a half year old son to go to sleep by himself and also help him learn relaxation techniques. I found the voice of the woman narrating the DVD creepy and surmise that my son felt the same because even though I was lying next to him in bed, he got out of bed and decided he didn't want to go to sleep yet. I couldn't blame him."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I purchased this CD for my 12 year old.

I lay down with her at night, and she tosses and turns etc, taking a long time to fall asleep. At first she complained this CD was actually keeping her awake, but I insisted she listen to it. After the 2nd night she liked it. This CD helped her relax. I quickly bought the other CD, Indigo Ocean Dreams, and she liked that one even more (Ocean Dreams is a man's voice instead of a womans). However, after a couple of weeks she complained she was bored with the stories. I then ordered Jim Weiss's CD - Good night. She likes this one best. It does not incorporate relaxation techniques into the CD, except it does have a lot of mental imagery. The stories are geared toward sleeping and are very relaxing! Good Night is a better choice for my daughter it seems."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My son is Autistic, and he loved the first CD in this series when I ordered it for him on a whim. The stories have helped teach him to let go of his anger, and by playing them at night when he's had a particularly overwhelming day I find him having more and more Good mornings. After story time I step out of the room and can hear him following the steps of what are guided meditations for children. Any of the CD's in this series are good. Some are geared a little more toward girls overall, but they all have something for all children. My son's favorite story disc is the one with the Angry Octopus. With the help of these CD's he truly understands now that he has control over his own emotions."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"We played this CD for the first time tonight as my 5-year-old was going to bed. Five-star results! Lately bedtime has been a zoo with her repeatedly getting out of bed and/or asking to be sat with until she falls asleep.

I am one relieved and hopeful mom."},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I bought this CD because my five children have a hard time winding down in the evenings at bedtime. Wow what a wonderful response my children have had. My son who is eleven goes to bed every night plugged into Indigo Dreams. He seems calmer and more at peace during the day. Best yet my oldest who is fifteen and suffers from an Autism Spectrum Disorder uses this to calm himself. He is begging for another CD and that is why I'm on today to purchase additional titles. I think anyone who has a special needs child, especially autistic should purchase this product for their child. I will recommend to all my friends with children.Thank you!!!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I ran across this audio CD quite on accident, but after reading about it, and reading some of the reviews, I thought it might be a nice option for bedtime listening for my 7 year old daughter. I could not be more pleased! My daughter tends to be a bit anxious, and often can wind herself up at bedtime imagining all the things that might go wrong the next day. When we would check on her at night, she never had the peaceful sleep of our younger daughter, but instead looked a bit tense, even in sleep. The first night we had her listen to the CD, we went in later to check on her, and she was completely sprawled out, arms overhead, and had the most serene smile on her face. It was beautiful! We have been using this CD for the last 6-7 weeks, and every night she falls asleep quickly and peacefully. Mornings are much more pleasant as well. She awakens in a great mood. I would recommend this CD to anyone with a child that could benefit from a peaceful night's sleep!!!"},{"Title":"Indigo Dreams: Relaxation and Stress Management Bedtime Stories for Children, Improve Sleep, Manage Stress and Anxiety (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My kids and I have listened to this, and it's very relaxing. My 4-yr-old son and 8-yr-old daughter have both been fairly wiggle-free during listening. It's a nice wind-down at the end of the day.

I love it as well and have found it to be very relaxing myself. I have some of my own relaxation CD's that I listen to and this CD uses the same methods for relaxation but in a kid friendly way!

The first time we listened to it, she was asleep by the time the second story was being read. It also works wonders for me when I have trouble falling asleep.I would also recommend this for women in labor. At my lamaze class, we learned the relaxation technique through story telling and this is a perfect example (Esp. the Goodnight Catapiller). My teacher read us a story imagining that our arms, legs, etc. were heavy and that they needed to be relaxed. This is just what this story does. It also teaches breathing techniques and helps you to visualize surroundings other than a stressful hospital room.My only complaint is that the deep breathing in the background music during \\"A Boy and a Bear\\" is kind of creepy. Other than that, we love this CD."},{"Title":"Lost Pueblo","review":"A really great Western Love Story. A real tear jerker with many twists. I only hope that someone will someday make this a movie. It's clever, enticing, and exciting. You won't want to put the book down after half way through."},{"Title":"Lost Pueblo","review":"This is a well-written story that exemplifies in popular format the ongoing clash between old values and modern thinking. As I read this story, these values seemed more cohesive and less unbreechable... as long as respect and love are part of the picture."},{"Title":"Lost Pueblo","review":"This was my first opportunity to read a Zane Grey Novel, and I was disappointed to find a poorly written period piece, lacking a believable storyline. None of the major characters in The Lost Pueblo were likeable, and everyone else unbelievably childish. The young woman was spoiled, but she was also egotistical and a sadist. She used men as she saw fit, and showed sadistic pleasure in punishing those who incurred her wrath. Her love interest was dedicated, aware of the beauty and the history of the landscape, but saw women as little more than children who may need the occasional spanking. The father was indulgent, but self-centered and controlling.The story evolved around an attempt by the father to save his daughter from moral corruption. Little did he seem to realize that her real problems were far deeper and more destructive. The Lost Pueblo is just another\\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\"story, where every man wants nothing more than to worship at her feet, while she seems unaware of everything and everybody beyond as a means to an end."},{"Title":"Lost Pueblo","review":"First published as \\"The Water Hole\\" in Collier's magazine in 1927, this is the love story between a 20 year old spoiled rich girl who was never deprived of anything in her life, and a young archaeologist who is hoping to make the discovery of a \\"lost\\" pueblo. The distinct differences of personalities--she free and easy and wild, and he, quiet, reserved, \\"old fashioned\\"--is cause for quite interesting circumstances to erupt between them. It makes for a different kind of book, with lots of twists and turns as Janey Endicot and Phillip Randolph struggle with their relationship. At one point Phillip \\"spanks\\" Janey; something that could only happen in a Zane Grey story. There are villains and pseudo-villains, a kidnapping, and a near lynching--enough action and pace to go along with all the romantic difficulties. It's a good read."},{"Title":"The Art of Loss: Poems by Myrna Stone","review":"In 'The Art of Loss' Myrna Stone starts with an ele-giac poem to a poetry friend and ends with an elegiac poem toher mother.

But in her mature, brilliant poems Myrna Stone doestriumph and bucks all of us up in the process-- with gems like&quot;Waiting for Daddy&quot;, &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, &quot;Your Last Mistress&quot;, and&quot;Home Movies&quot;, to name just a few. And her poems dealing withVan Gogh and Degas are superb ( &quot;The Tub&quot; is flat out aces.)Stephen Dunn says that in Myrna Stone's poems &quot;wesee pathos rise to the level of the sublime&quot;-- a statementthat got me thinking of Charlie Chaplin, how he would haveloved these poems!

So I find Myrna Stone's poems immensely satisfying.Open her book at random, as I just have. \\"Penitential\\" says that on Saturday evening we went to church, perhaps for confession, perhaps for \\"devotions.\\" Our religion impressed us with our guilt and need for penance.

To my mind and ear, these poems are a treasure."},{"Title":"Films of the 1920s","review":"This book is a collection of modern and contemporary articles about silent film, with the last ten or so being reviews of mostly under-rated films of the 1920's. The stories by cameraman James Wong Howe and theatre organist Gaylord Carter give a great impression of what it was like to work in the industry. Moral czar Will Hayes also has an interesting (?) story to tell also. This book is a little over-priced because it is not very long but it is definitely recommended for silent film buffs."},{"Title":"Melting Pot","review":"I wasn't in the mood to read a play, but the plot sounded intriguing, all about a Jewish musician in love with a shiksa. The interesting thing is the woman is initially anti-Semitic, but the musician comes from the same town she does in Russia, where most of his family was murdered in a pogrom years ago. His kind manner and obvious trauma turns her around--a little too quickly for me, but after all this is only a three-act play.My only real complaint is that dialogue is written phonetically whenever someone speaks with an accent. I'd rather just be told they're speaking with a heavy German or Irish accent than have it spelled out in unintelligible dialect. Worse yet, the grandmother's lines are entirely in Yiddish without any translation. Even if she never speaks English when the play is actually performed, it would be nice to know what she's saying while just reading the thing."},{"Title":"Writing Japanese Katakana: An Introductory Japanese Language Workbook","review":"simple format, but gives you a nice writing exercises. choice of words are authentic and not bad. recommended for beginner."},{"Title":"Writing Japanese Katakana: An Introductory Japanese Language Workbook","review":"I needed to learn katakana as a prerequisite for a class I wanted to take.

The true stories about a lifetime of selling make it worth reading it alone, even if you never put any of the great ideas to use.When I first ran into this book, (and Chuck, I happen to have bought it from him personally) I was an artist trying to be a signpainter who secretly held the idea that having to sell anything was selling out. Chuck Lewis changed my mind from with this book. I particularly enjoyed his ideas of tailoring your selling to the positive advantages rather than appealing to the doom of negative costs. Stuck in my mind forever is one of Chuck's observations that any emotional appeals can have a positive side to them: &quot;Pride without fear is a desire for excellence.&quot;The other thing his book taught me that I still use almost every day twenty years later: &quot;tell people what it is, how it works and what it can do for them.&quot; That one little hint from the book has not only transformed my attitude about presenting my ideas, it has made me a better communicator in general!"},{"Title":"Catalonia","review":"This is a highly detailed, exhaustive survey of the Spanish region of Catalonia. McRoberts traces the development of Catalan nationhood from its origins in the early middle ages through the golden age of maritime trade, persistence under Franco's stifling dictatorship, and toward its present state. He explains the tension within Catalan society between those favoring greater integration with Spain and those seeking more autonomy for the region, or even complete independence. Catalonia's political situation is also covered, though to the uninitiated the dizzying array of parties may become confusing (the appendix to Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" comes to mind). Lastly, its economic situation is treated within the framework of European integration. Those already acquainted with Catalonia, or with an abiding interest in it, will find McRoberts's work rewarding. Others may find it dry. Still, as the first and only contemporary survey of the region in English, this study fills a void on this important and often overlooked corner of Europe."},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"Quentin Durward is good reading, right up (almost) to the very end. It's excellent historical fiction with very rich characterization, especially of Louis XI. Excellent, that is, except for the women. While two of the minor female characters are interesting, the female lead is as dull as dishwater. My real complaint is that the ending is bungled. After the tremendous buildup full of exciting action and convincing sets, you turn the page and...it's just over! Misses the crecendo and the denoument.

He told me \\"Quentin Durward\\". The next time we were in a bookstore together, I found a paperback copy of this book and bought it...for 75 cents! When I read this book, I entered the medieval world of knights, kings, lovely medieval ladies, and chivalry. I later learned that Quentin Durward is about fighting to preserve moral order in a changing world. What book could be more relevant today? I just bought this book for my 13 year old son, and he has it on his list of books to read this summer. The generations in my family will be connected by this book and the themes it addresses.p.s.

I was struck by how modern -- or even post-modern -- its structure is. For one thing, the novel is a narrated by fictitious narrator named Sir Walter Scott, honest, who stumbles into a private library salvaged from pre-revolutionary France; for another, its annotations reference sources which may or may not exist, but which the fictitious narrator claims he read in the private library referenced above. Further, with the exception of the heroine (dish-water dull, I agree), the characters all behave as modern people would. Yet, as far as I can tell, Borges never wrote about Sir Walter Scott. Go figure."},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"I believe that Sir Walter Scott was the man who invented the historical novel, and they say that this is one of his finest efforts. Certainly, it puts a lot of modern fiction into the shade, especially the sort of modern novel which amounts to prolonged gazing at one's own navel. (I haveThe Sense of an Ending (Borzoi Books)in mind...)But this is heresy! How can you possibly prefer clunky old Walter Scott (SO unfashionable!) to the winner of the Man Booker Prize (SO fashionable!). My only answer is that literary reputations come, and literary reputations go. Time was, when Sir Walter Scott was one of the best-read authors in history, but his reputation took a serious dive when \\"real writers\\" such as Ezra Pound and James Joyce came along.Nevertheless, \\"Quentin Durward\\" is very good reading. Not only is it a good story, you will actually gain some valuable knowledge about history, in particular the French king Louis XI, and the Duke of Burgundy.How about the style? Well, when I was in 8th grade I decided it was impenetrable, even yucky. But the decades passed (as they will) and now the style offers no impediment whatsoever.One very refreshing thing is that Quentin Durward is a Complete Pre-Feminist Male Hero. He is strong, valiant, a terrifying fighter, and extremely good-looking into the bargain. He respects women, and shows them every courtesy; in fact, at the end of the novel he almost surrenders his greatest love to rescue a Flemish girl who has been captured by a gang of soldiers with no good intentions. On top of that, he is nobly born, and expects that others treat him accordingly, mostly because he conducts himself according to a strict code of nobility.And all of these things are gone, gone with the wind -- if they ever really existed.I'm looking forward to reading more from this author, especially since you can get his complete works for the Kindle for almost nothing. :-)"},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"This 2008 (Bibliolife)Bibliobazaar edition of Quentin Durward (paperback and probably hardcover too)has bright white paper but the text is too small.

Rawe, which is to be found in the Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.About the play itself I will say nothing other than it is the greatest play of the greatest playwright of the ancient world.Concerning the text as presented by Dawe, it was interesting to pleasurable to read and compare his own particular edition of the play with that of other editors such as Jebb and Hugh Lloyd-Jones. Unfortunately, not being a scholar of the manuscript tradition, I can say nothing about the judiciousness of his particular editorial choices.Regarding the commentary, I found it excellent, particularly in its explanations of particle combinations and its highlighting of peculiar diction on Sophocles' part.Excellent though it is, I should stress that it is clearly not aimed at students of Greek who are only beginning their study of Greek tragedy, since Dawe passes over in silence much that would be obscure and difficult to inexperienced students. That said, it would still be an interesting and illuminating commentary for a the more inexperienced student so long as he or she used it in conjunction with another commentary oriented to beginners in tragedy -- the best such commentary would be that published in the amazing Bryn Mawr Commentary series.What struck me most about Dawe's commentary was the wonderfully dry sense of humor that expresses itself from time to time. It is the only commentary on an ancient Greek text that I've read which actually had me laughing out loud on a number of occasions.All in all, then, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"&quot;Oedipus the King&quot; (or, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;) is probably Sophocles' most famous work, first performed about 429 B. C. It should be required reading for every college Freshman (or High School student). As had been prophesied, Oedipus unknowingly kills his father, Laius, and unknowingly marries his own mother, Jocasta (or, Iocasta). The play has great use of irony. Jocasta recognizes the truth before Oedipus and tries to prevent him from finding out. The play has unsurpassed use of dramatic irony. The play inspires fear and pity in the audience for the hero. It has had a great influence on later authors."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex is a timeless, masterpiece of a tragedy whose greatness and complexity far transcends the age in which it was written. Sophecles skillfully delves into the depths of human behavior, and discerns an acute knowledge of the components which compromise the human behavior which he is studying. Human desires, the human moral code, and the human sense of remorse are three of the facets of human behavior which Sophocles conveys to us through Oedipus in his rise to power and subsequent demise. Reading Oedipus Rex can not only provide a powerful and extraordinary literary experience, but can also pose an oppurtunity for examination and reflection regarding human behavior at large, and the behavior of one's self. After reading Oedipus, it is not difficult to understand why Aristotle proclaimed Sophocles' epic to be civilization's greatest work."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"this is one of the best plays ever written, as well as one of the earliest. oedipus has become very much a part of our culture, and the oedipus plays should be required reading. fitzgerald and fitts did a wonderful job in the translation."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex was one of the-if not the- best Greek play ever written.

Overall, this play was just wonderful..."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex is truly timeless. The copy I read was not entirely poetic, but the story of a man ruined by his own pride and arrogance presents humankind with a portrait of itself.

Sophocles is not just a playwright, but a proven social critic."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex is ancient work that still remains popular today. It is one of those works that many of us were forced to read in high school or even college. However, Oedipus Rex can simply be one of those books you can easily read for pleasure. It is a tragic tale of a man who goes through life thinking he is someone that he turns out not to be. Oedipus' life is cursed by an old prophecy that said that he would marry his mother and kill his father, if he was not himself killed as an infant. As it turns out, he is not killed but ends up fulfilling this horrible prophecy. This book has easy to follow dialogue and really gets the readers full attention. Oedipus Rex is a short book that we all can relate to when we are having a bad day or when we feel that nothing is going right for us. After reading this book, you will come to realize that life is nowhere as horrible as that of the tragic hero Oedipus. I encourage everyone who is going through trying times to read this book, and I guarantee it will make him or her feel much better."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex a story for the ages, one which is relatable to our time today and hundreds of years ago. Sophocles tells a story of a prophesy, of Oedipus' life where he is destined to kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus tries to run but he was no match for fate, read the book to find out what happens. This story was one which entails many aspects of human nature, and i suggest this book to everyone, it was a great story."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"This sick and twisted plot is actually pretty amazing.

Nevertheless, his trilogy is a phenomenal piece of literature. The construction of this is superb. WITHOUT REALIZING IT, Oedipus has murdered his father, married his mother, and has had children with his mother. This horror filled play DEFINES Aristotle's theory of recognition. Gradually we (along with Oedipus) are exposed to bits of information that lead to the discovery of what has happened. The true horror is when the clues start getting bigger and more obvious. When I finished the 1st of the trilogy, I was so overcome with horror that I had to smoke some cigarettes to calm down. But remember, the play DOES NOT end here. It continues in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; (Part 2) and &quot;Antigone&quot; (Part 3)."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"This is a play full of dramatic and tragic irony. What are the odds of killing your father and marrying your mother without knowing. Oedipus Rex was abandoned as a child because of a prophecy saying he would grow up to kill his father, the king, and marry his mother. He grew up a peasant and one day killed a king who was traveling the opposite way on the same road as he. Obvious to us, this was his father. He later solves a riddle to save the city and is made king. He therefore must marry the queen unbeknown to him as his mother. The truth finally comes out of the mouth of a blind prophet who forsay it all in the beginning. Although you may be forced to read this play in high school or in college it is still a great play to read. It is short and easy to follow and makes for great class discussions."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"This is an excellent text--but I find the play much more difficult than the Antigone and Jebb's notes are more extensive. One critic notes that these difficulties arise from the fact that in the Oedipus--the characters are \\"in the dark\\" and therefore the irony of certain tricky syntactical units or puns or even secondary meanings of words is essential to Sophocles' great work. In the Antigone I found these problems less daunting precisely because all the characters are aware of their actions and consequences--thus the linguistic ironies of the Oedipus are less necessary.Dawe has done a splendid job but I believe that the notes in Sir Richard Jebbs edition are (for me at least) essential. While I am not really competent to judge the difficulties of establishing a \\"authoritative\\" text--I believe no one has surpassed Jebb's monumental achievement."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"Oedipus Rex is one of the more interesting plays to come from Greece. It is the first part of a trilogy of plays. This play concerns King Oedipus and how he attempts to solve a puzzle in order to save the city of Athens from a plauge. Oedipus is a very tragic figure in the fact that what he is seeking will ultimately lead to his downfall. This is his tragic flaw as a character. It is also ironic that the play deals with the idea of inescapable fate. Oedipus' fate was sealed from his birth and his parents sent him away in order to keep this event from occuring. The event occurs anyways. An interesting thing is that Oedipus became king by solcing the riddle of the sphynx, and the people are calling on him again in order to stop the plague. An example of the same technique would be the movie &quot;Angel Heart.&quot; Definately one of the classics."},{"Title":"Oedipus Rex (MCI) (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)","review":"I managed, only because I knew the story.It's good, but definately kind of disturbing.

Initially, I was astounded, I thought that it was some sort of abnormality, but then upon reading Freud, I learned that it was part of child development.

Other celebrities her age have graduated to bigger and better things while Cat has remained in what she refers to as the &quot;seventh circle of celebrity hell.&quot; Plus, as much as Cat enjoys buying the latest designer clothes, accessories, and tickets to the latest charity-of-the-week soiree, it's no surprise her credit is suffering and trust fund depleted.

When her extravagant ways finally catch up to her, her sudden poverty forces her to do what she must to survive--snag a rich husband.Now, generally, I love this type of light, breezy, &quot;girl in the city&quot; novel. However, I personally found this protagonist just a little too exaggerated to be entirely sympathetic. I understand that this is supposed to be satire, that we're supposed to laugh at Cat's numerous follies, such as her adoption of a Chinese baby to impress a man. Often, I did laugh. However, if this is satire, I just didn't feel that anything was, in fact, sufficiently skewered. The moneyed, name-dropping, hypocritical New York social scene is, to some extent, held up to ridicule. Yet, there is also a sense of adulation and a longing to belong. It's as if the author is saying, &quot;Yes, it's superficial and cruel--but wouldn't you love to be a part of it?&quot;I won't deny that it can be entertaining. It does offer an amusing glimpse into the glamorous world of New York celebrity. However, for me, it just didn't work well enough as a satire, or even as a regular &quot;girl in the city&quot; romance.

The main character, a Brit named Rebecca, was engagingly endearing as she shopped and spent way beyond her means and into one tight and/or ridiculous predicament after another. In CAT'S MEOW by Melissa de la Cruz, the main character, a New Yorker named Cat McAllister, lives according to the same spendthrift modus operandi overlaid with a bratty, self-centered shallowness and monumental snootiness. (If you remember the TV series NEWHART of the 1980s, recall the spoiled and vain Stephanie Vanderkellen role played marvelously by Julia Duffy. Cat is another Stephanie, and then some.)Cat is a former Hollywood child star, now almost forgotten, who lives solely on the trust fund set up by her deceased Dad. Without gainful employment, she spends her time and inherited money in ceaseless and ultimately futile efforts to be trendy, fashionable, and seen with the Big Apple's Beautiful People, and be noticed by high society columnists. Cat's best friend is a sex-changed male now calling herself India. Her nemesis is another social climber, former friend Teeny Van der Hominie, who effortlessly manages to be everything that Cat aspires to be but isn't. Cat's goal is to marry Prince Stephan of Westonia, reputedly the heir to some little known central European pocket state, who will rescue her from penury and social obscurity.I can't deny that CAT'S MEOW is amusing. It occasionally is, and for that reason I reluctantly toss it three barely flickering stars. However, McAllister is positively annoying. Since de la Cruz is heavily involved with the New York fashion \\"scene\\", I gather that her novel was written to be a satire. However, that doesn't mean the author can't or shouldn't make her primary character at least nominally likeable. Instead, Cat comes across as gratingly insufferable. If I was unfortunate enough to know such a woman in real life, I'd immediately relegate her in my mind to the useless margin of humanity. As for the book itself, I found myself at the end hurrying to finish so I could get on to something more substantive and worthwhile.At one point Cat is forced to look for a real job. Without any qualifications whatsoever, she brazenly applies with Conde Nast publications for a fashion editor position.\\"I took the famous Conde Nast elevators and prepared myself for the infamous elevator stare down between competing editrixes, but only found myself next to a slovenly maintenance man. I gave him a hard glare nevertheless. Overalls are so over.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Meow: A Novel","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewers were reading, but this was absolutely horrible!

I was hoping for your typical 20-something single living in Manhattan novel, which Cat's Meow is, but I wanted some entertainment. The humor was non-gratifying and seemed to play to a very small group in society; the fashion socialites of Manhattan. The author throws around celebrity and fashion guru names as if the general public has any idea who she is referring to. This aside, the biggest problem I had with the book was the mockery the author made out of international adoption. Cat sends her personal asistant to China to buy a baby girl from an illegal baby broker not because she wants to be a mother, but because it is the &quot;in&quot; thing to do and she hopes it will help her marry rich."},{"Title":"Cat's Meow: A Novel","review":"This is one fun novel!

The main character, Cat McAlister is rude and spoiled but inexplicably lovable and charming. SHe's a hoot. The author has written a smart, kooky, and laugh-out-loud funny fashion satire, and has shown the New York scene to be the vastly empty, social-climbing and publicity-driven hellhole that it is. The arch-villain, Teeny Wong Finklestein Van der Hominie, is evil, scheming, hilarious and reminded me of either Paris HIlton or Gwyneth Paltrow.The book documents Cat's attempt to rise above the fray, to find a rich husband that will pay her debts, and bring her tabloid noteriety. But while her cares are profoundly shallow, there's a vulnerability and innate sweetness to her. As a fan of over-the-top humor - (AbFab and Sex and the City) this is one more to add to the cannon.Anyone who enjoys reading the National Enquirer, Vanity Fair, and Page Six will love this book!"},{"Title":"Cat's Meow: A Novel","review":"Shallow spenders are some of the current trend faves in poolside fiction, and Cat McAllister is one of that not-so-exalted club. &quot;Cat's Meow&quot; is an amusing fluff novel with a few pointed barbs at the superficiality of the rich and famous, but not much more.Cat McAllister was a minor child star, a teen model in Japan, and is now celebrating her twenty-fifth birthday (for the fourth time -- my, what a funny thing time is). Now she's a trust-fund fashionista, with little to do but shop and spend with fellow celebrities and socialites. What's more, she hopes to catch the eye of an obscure European prince, Stephan -- assuming that someone else doesn't snare him. To impress him with her charity and selflessness, she arranges to adopt a Chinese orphan baby, aided by her feisty transsexual pal India, and loyal maid Bannerjee.Until she receives the devastating news: her fund is now empty. What will she do? Marry a rich guy, if she can, and in the meantime must gird her loins and take on a new challenge: getting a job, despite having no skills. Much to the delight of the poisonous top socialite Teeny Van der Hominie, Cat has to vacate her apartment, and takes a position on a blossoming webzine focusing on fashion and the New York nightlife.&quot;Cat's Meow&quot; name-drops almost to a fault (including a cameo by Prince William), and lampoons the rich and shallow who are not required to make anything of their lives. Yet it's hard to tell if the lampooning is wholehearted; near the end the tone toward the lampooned start to look mildly alluring. Sort of, &quot;yeah, I know it's all stupid, but it's still kind of fun.&quot;The writing is pretty fluffy and undetailed, sprinkled with New York fashionista insights about clothes, Botox, ex-boyfriends and special temperature-controlled wardrobes. (I am not making that up) It's amusing at times, assuming that you are not annoyed too much by Cat's bumbling.Cat is essentially a spoiled rich-kid, who is offered a prime position at a major magazine and turns it down because it's too menial; fortunately, De la Cruz keeps her amusing with things like the &quot;Muslim chic&quot; costume or her baby, unfortunately named Boing. She's certainly more likable at the end than at the beginning. Stephan is a Ken doll; Bannerjee is amusing, with her crush on Prince William. But it's India who steals the show as the take-no-guff transsexual best friend.If you're looking for an amusing fluff novel about love, money, celebrity and weirdly-named babies, this might be a nice diversion.

The main character Cat is a total airhead and so selfish, it made me want to stop reading entirely. For example, there was a reality in The Devil Wears Prada that made me really like Andy, relate to her and want to see her succeed in the challenging world of high fashion.

It could give answers as to what motivates people to acquire wealth in spite of not having enough time to enjoy this wealth and shed light on why some people are risk adverse while others are not. If neuroeconomics is to be a successful theory it must of course deal with what is real and observable, and not engage in fanciful, philosophical speculation. This is another way of saying that it must be scientific in its methodologies, however difficult this might become. To perform real-time experiments in economics is extremely difficult, and this difficulty is exacerbated by the need to integrate what is observed in the everyday life with what is observed in laboratory experiments on the brain that are performed with the assistance of fMRI and other brain-scanning techniques. This book is an effort to introduce the field of neuroeconomics as a counter to what the author calls the \`classical Cartesian paradigm' and its arbitrary classification of behaviors into \`simple' and \`complex'. The simple behaviors are essentially deterministic and are now called \`reflexes.' Complex behaviors, on the other hand, are the result of processes that occur in the \`soul', and have no discernable relation between cause and effect. These processes are called \`cognitive mechanisms\\" by some and their scientific viability has been cast in doubt.The book should not be considered one that attempts to establish the field of neuroeconomics as a scientific one. Instead, the author wants to define cognitive mechanisms in the same way as that done in the field of economics. Only then can they be referred to as scientific, argues the author, and he further asserts that the use of reflexes itself is not scientifically viable. It is therefore the Cartesian paradigm of dualism that the author argues against, and neuroeconomics plays on a minor role in his case. Readers may therefore be disappointed if they are expecting a more thorough discussion of neuroeconomics. Indeed, it is only in the last two chapters of the book that the author gets down to analyzing the neural correlates of economic decision-making.In these chapters the author discusses experiments that he and a collaborator performed that point to the parietal cortex as being the part of the brain that is responsible for decision-making. It is interesting that for animals at least, game theory is thought to be the best computational model for indeterminate decision-making. Bayesian probability theory plays a role in these computational models, and work from ecological biologists is quoted as supporting the notion that models based on economics are needed to describe the decision-making processes of animals as they encounter situations where fitness must be maximized. The author gives examples of how neuroeconomic strategies can be employed in practice, but he is also aware of the enormity of the problem of building a complete neuroeconomic theory of the brain, a task requiring large amounts of empirical data and an understanding of how individual behaviors have their origins in computational processes that occur in various neural modules in the brain."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"Glimcher looks carefully at a paper by Shadlen & Newsome on MT neurons in behavioral paradigms. The concept of Neuroeconomics as developed in the book Behavioral Game Theory by Colin Camerer is developed somewhat by Glimcher, but I think he realizes we are at the beginning of the role of uncertainty and probability in brain function. Certainly digital EEGs and brain waves show randomness, even though Llinas and others claim that 40 Hz. is the frequency of binding. I think there are going to be other binding frequencies as well. Multielectrode arrays will allow us to look not only at frequency maps, but spatial, color, and other probability maps through redundancy and repetition of brain symbols in adjacent microanatomical regions of the brain, like in V1 in the primate. Glimcher begins his glorious ride and tour through Neuroscience by describing its History: DesCartes, John Stuart Mill, Sherrington, and so on. This book is written for the specialist and the novice; the writing style is simple and lucid. Paul models probabilistically LIP neurons by looking at receptive field paradigms. Near the end of the book, Glimcher ties everything together in a cohesive theory of Neuroeconomics. This will prove to be a valid and interesting approach to neurophysiological function. Another book to look at exploring similar issues is Probabilistic Models of the Brain by Rao."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"One of this book's greatest gifts is to clearly explain how our thinking about our thinking (neuroscience) has evolved over the past 2000 years. This book makes a significant contribution to the readers' historical understanding of psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and game theory.One weakness of the book's approach is the lack of references to affect (emotion), which is suggested to have an impact on human utility and probability estimations in (Loewenstein, Loewenstein, Weber, & Welch, 2000), (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, and MacGregor, 2002), and (Knutson and Peterson, 2003). In fact, Glimcher states: \\"Neuroeconomics provides a model of the architecture that links brain and behavior. Mind, though it may very much exist, simply does not figure in that equation (p343).\\"The author's conclusions are limited to a logical, computational frame of reference - a form of computational behaviorism. This style certainly has applications within limited experimental games, but it is doubtful that it will provide significant insight into the workings of complex dynamic systems, such as the financial markets, without incorporating symbolic psychological concepts (such as affect).This book is an excellent introduction to the field of neuroeconomics. Glimcher's exposition of the evolution of neuroscientific thought is fascinating and worth savoring. Glimcher's discussion of game theory is fascinating, but applications to real-world environments are not directly posited.The latter half of the book, while intellectually interesting, reads much like an expanded academic journal article. Glimcher explains his lab's experimental trials and tribulations in much of the second half..."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"Deisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain feels undigested, as if the author crammed in the library for a month and wrote a book on his notes.Part I covers the neuro-, Part II covers the -economics, but instead of Part III, covering neuroeconomics, there's a 17-page-short chapter called &quot;Putting It All Together.&quot;For most of the book, things don't merge. For example, chapter 5 describes important experiments by Newsome and Shadlen that are not really neuroeconomics. Four seemingly tacked-on paragraphs at the end of the chapter argue that neuroeconomics has something to say about the experiments. But it's not clear what that is, and it's not clear why Glimcher didn't choose a more obviously relevant example.A more general problem is that Glimcher argues throughout that current approaches to neuroscience are all reflex-based, and we need a major paradigm shift to make any more progress in brain research. But the examples he gives that employ his new paradigm seem to be well within the realm of normal cognitive neurophysiology. For example, the Ciaramitaro et al. attention experiments described in chapter 13 are elegant, but don't come across as paradigm shifting, in either the chapter, or the original Vision Research paper. Neuroeconomics comes to seem like just another tool in the toolbox, instead of a big new theory.It may be that there is no Part III because the science has not yet happened. In which case, not writing more about it was a good thing to do. Parsimony is a virtue, but if there is not enough of a story to tell, I would have liked to see the author present his ideas about the major problems for the field, a Hilbert's 23 for neuroscience in the 21st century. Instead chapter 13 gives us four toy problems in primate physiology.The best parts of the book are the history. Some of the stories are familiar, but most are not, and all are told engagingly. Although they don't really come together into a cohesive whole, they are interesting on their own, and a reader with a detailed knowledge of the field can connect most of the dots."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"70 years ago, behavioral economists were trapped outside the black box for the same reasons everyone was: science couldn't see inside the brain directly. Like behavioral psychologists, they decided to make a virtue out of a neccessity and ignore the black box.Now behavioral economists can look inside the black box, but most choose to ignore it, perhaps because the learning curves on physiology and imaging are so steep.Glimcher argues in this wonderful book that neuroscientists are unwittingly trapped inside the same black box, and need a way out. Maybe they can befriend those behavioral economists. Consider this book an arranged date that will hopefully turn into a long marriage.It is rare for a book aimed at the public to be written by a young and active scientist. The obvious comparison is Spikes, by Reike, et al. But whereas Spikes was too mathematical for the general reader, Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain never getsboring. It describes fascinating experiments, both 100 years old and being done right now. Experiments that you've never heard of, but you should. Best of all, it describes them passionately and non-scarily.More importantly, Decisions points throughout to directions for future research, rather than only describing past experiments.Don't be fooled by the book's elegance. It is meticulously crafted to be enjoyable to the lay reader but also highly rewarding someone more familiar with the research described. In short, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"It begins with the subtitle \\"The Science of Neuroeconomics\\" - what does that term even mean? As far as I can tell, Glimcher never defines it. Somewhere along the line he does tell us, as if it's a novel insight, that the purpose of the brain is 'decision making'. Now, if we define decision-making as selection of behavior from multiple options, this is as obvious as saying that the function of the heart is to circulate blood. In studying 'neuroeconomics', Glimcher is really just studying neuroscience - how the brain controls behavior. The term is nothing but fancy repackaging for the business/econ crowd.If it were just the term, I could easily forgive the oversell. However, Glimcher recounts an entire selective history of neuroscience to convince you that he is part of a group of scientists who are radically changing the way we think about ourselves. Glimcher first introduces Descartes' dualism with which to anchor his book. Various figures are introduced, culminating in Sherrington, who shift neuroscience to a deterministic, reflex-oriented framework (strangely, he never once mentions the name Skinner). While a few early 20th-century neurophysiologists are introduced who challenged these theories of sensory-driven reflex-like behavior, he then skips over half a century of neuroscience and psychology to inform us that certain recent models still have a 'reflex-like' flavor. Ignored is the entire cognitive revolution, and the foundation of cognitive neuroscience. David Marr is the lone exception, introduced as a prophet, apparently the first and only person to propose that the brain should be studied based on its computational goals.Okay, I should forgive the simplification of history, right? It is set up to aggrandize 'neuroeconomists', but then again to some extent it is deserved - there was a revolution in decision-making research in the 1990s. So perhaps the most galling feature of this book is that Glimcher doesn't even address much of this work. How can you write a book about decision-making in 2003 without reference to reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia, and dopamine? Okay, in fairness it gets one measly page towards the end (as an example of 'neuroeconomics' applications), but the experimental focus is all on the parietal cortex, which Glimcher happened to study.In addition to being selective and incomplete, Glimcher has a habit of making vague and tenuous connections. For example, he introduces Godel's incompleteness theorem, and makes vague allusions to it being somehow related to nondeterministic behavior. While he appears to be channeling Penrose, he never does pin this point down, so it is unclear exactly what he is saying. Similarly, he likes to make a big deal about 'Bayesian' approaches, while demonstrating only that probabilistic approaches are necessary. He claims that 'classical monism cannot explain nondeterministic behavior', and seems to be claiming that the mere introduction of probability into behavior radically revamps neuroscience (it doesn't - one can imagine reflex-like circuits that are probabilistic). Don't get me wrong, there appears to be a deep connection between many of these concepts - but Glimcher does not make that connection in this book. The book is ultimately far too bold for what it presents."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"This book is much more than its title. It provides a fascinating history of neurobiology and probability/game theory, leading up to the thesis that the brain is a Bayesian probability calculator and game-theoretic randomizer.The Bayesian part refers to the ability of the brain to combine current incoming sensory data with current priors to estimate probabilities relevant to current decision-making. The game-theoretic randomizer part refers to the fact that to succeed in the evolutionary game, an animal, say a caveman, needs to act somewhat unpredictably so as not to be eaten by a predator. If the caveman were totally predicable in his/her actions, then an evolutionary adversary could predict what he/she was going to do, and use that information to defeat him or her. This is consistent with optimal strategies which are derived through game theory a la von Neumann.The science is not certain how the brain accomplishes this (yet); however, it appears to be through parts of the brain continually estimating likelihoods, with thresholds that, when exceeded, result in actions on the part of the individual.I am very happy that I saw this book in the MIT Press display at the ASSA conferences this January, and that it had a cool-looking illustration on the cover, or I probably wouldn't have bought it. I highly recommend it.In the interest of completness, I should mention some of the things I didn't like so much. First of all, I wish that Glimcher had mentioned the research of DaMasio, who wrote a fascinating book named \\"DeCarte's Error\\". In that book DeMasio presents a thesis that emotions pay a key role in decision-making. As pointed out by other reviewers, Glimcher doesn't even mention this line of research. Secondly, the book was a bit dry and academic in tone from time to time, but that is a small complaint given how interesting the content was."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"Interestingly I wrote my first review on PG's book almost 3 years ago.Today after more study more degrees more experience more knowledgeabout the world and about me I am sold.Brilliant mind and book.This book is better than any science fiction book or movieincluding Ray Bradbury and today one of my favorite tool.The whole thing makes me feel like spitting in the air and try to predictwhere that s gonna go?In my second reading or I should say studying PG 's book made me realizeif we can have neuroeconomics we could certainly have psychoeconomics or psychaeconomicsand I am very excited about that.So PG is going ahead and throwing himself out of a planewith an unchecked parachute but he s not jumping aloneanother guy is jumping with him essentially David marr.So the more jumpers we get the more experience will be accumulatedand may provide a veriification for many of PG's points and his probabilities of survivalafter he jumps.What are the chances PG will land safely on planet hearth?That jump to me resumes PG's book.Meanwhile the goal define the question thanks to the genius of David Marr.Another conclusion seems to me it is not to have one so I ll have to agreeat many levels nothing is predetermined unless of course it is but how do we know that?Keep your mind open forget all you know and just hang on...This book is a huge adventure in the unknown realm of planet earth the universeand the most unknown of all mysteries the human being and am all for it...It is the most amazing book I reopened lately..."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"Offhand one might think that the hybrid neologism \\"neuroeconomics\\" would refer to an interdisciplinary approach to economic theory where neuroscience contributes a novel insight of some sort. The book's title reinforces this view, giving top billing to the lexical inducers \\"decisions\\" and \\"uncertainty\\" while the word \\"brain\\" straggles at list's end. In point of fact, economics, properly speaking, has little to do with the new discipline's thematic content. Author Paul Glimcher, a professor and researcher who heads his own Glimcher Lab at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, begins this highly readable narrative not with a tale from economics but with an anecdote from the annals of automata, Jacques de Vaucanson's mechanical duck (1738), harking back to an epoch when economics had yet to see the light of day.The much-ballyhooed duck quickly yields center stage to the star culprit of the show, its compatriot the polymath Ren&eacute; Descartes, who a century earlier had fused the distinct realms of geometry and algebra into monistic analytic geometry --a cornerstone of modern mathematics-- before tearing asunder body and soul with his idea of physiological dualism. Descartes held that two categories of behaviors existed: simple behaviors in which sensory events triggered deterministic motor responses automatically (or reflexively), and complex behaviors where responses were not entirely predictable (nondeterministic). An explanation of the latter category, Descartes believed, required positing the soul as the requisite mechanism for producing volitional behavior. The former category of fully deterministic behaviors, where no volition or reasoning was necessary, became known as reflexes.Alas, the reflexological paradigm long remained the only game in town for explanatory purposes and in due course preempted the soul in scientific discourse. Complex behaviors came to be seen as the product of complex chains of reflexes, notwithstanding the enormous difficulties of understanding volition in terms of mindless knee-jerk reactions. Eventually (the book admirably discusses the details I omit of this intellectual journey), the pioneering computational neuroscientist, David Marr, introduced a paradigm-shifting approach: the brain as a goal-seeking (i.e., cybernetic) system.The second half of the book discusses developments after Marr's untimely passing. Laboratory experiments of visual-saccadic processing in the primate brain are amply discussed. Of particular interest, the role of economics in the newly proposed theory of neurophysiology is duly presented. According to the book, it boils down to two mathematical approaches to decision making: Bayesian decision-theoretic modeling, widely known as decision analysis, and game theory.Now, decision analysis and game theory are excellent tools for analyzing economic problems, granted. But they are neither limited to economics nor did they arise within the confines of that field. They are actually the product of decision-theoretic mathematics that find application in economics but also in behavioral ecology, artificial intelligence, the theory of evolution, strategic management, military science, contemporary philosophy, public policy analysis, communication network engineering, politics, law, love, poker tournaments and what have you. On the other hand, standard economic concepts such as the law of demand, price elasticities, marginal revenues and costs, inflation, business cycles, market failure and the principal-agent problem, to mention a mere few, are conspicuously absent. Why then should economics get the credit?I would have gone along with Marr's vision and christened the thing \\"neurocybernetics,\\" which is, after all, the essence of the new paradigm. It also dovetails with Vaucanson's duck, which clearly owes nothing to economics. Aside from that, the book offers a great read in the history and current developments of neuroscience. If you think neurons are fairly interesting, you will most likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"This book offers an outstanding survey of philosophy, psychology, brain science, economics, and the field that brings them all together, neuroeconomics. Paul W. Glimcher contends that Descartes' deterministic theory that simple behavior operates according to reflexes is influential far beyond its merits. He describes numerous experiments that support a very different understanding of behavior, which says that organisms seeking to fulfill their own goals (mostly to perpetuate their genes) must \\"choose\\" behaviors that somehow account for risk and return. In other words, they maximize \\"inclusive fitness\\" under conditions of uncertainty. Laboratory experiments and field research by behavioral ecologists lend considerable support to this view. We recommend this solid, layman's introduction to neuroeconomics and a remarkable series of discoveries."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"Great book about history of neuroscience from Descartes to the present and where it moves next. Ideas are clearly expressed and convincing evidence is presented. Somewhat populist, though, but interesting to read. Good for beginners in neuroscience like myself."},{"Title":"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (Bradford Books)","review":"OpinionI typically enjoy books combining my interests in science and economics. I am currently a dual major student in both biology and management and so a book like this really appeals to me. Paul W. Glimcher's book \\"Decisions, Uncertainty, and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics\\" delves deep into advanced economic theories in an attempt to explain how the brain can calculate value and risk without a full set of information. The title of this book implies that the brain is constantly dealing with uncertainty during decision making processes, and the author argues that a transition away from a solely reflex-based model is necessary in understanding complex behaviors. The book itself leaves the reader a bit uncertain in the end with only a very small chapter \\"Putting It All Together\\" to explain the interplay between neuroscience and economics in decision making.Structure of the BookThis book is written in two parts and contains a final chapter entitled \\"Putting It All Together.\\" The first part, Part I, covers the history and background of the neuroscience related topics that the book is trying to address with specific examples about the brain and central nervous system's role in stimulus response. Part II of the book focuses on the key economic topics, particularly game theory, to show a mathematical basis for determining, and perhaps eventually predicting, the future of neuroeconomics.Interesting ElementsThe book does represent an emerging field of thinking and is on the forefront of a new movement that may come to define investing decision making. That being said, the major accomplishments that this book puts forward are the detailed experiments that Glimcher himself performed on monkeys and humans that characterize his theory that science should utilize economics to help explain complex decisions that incorporate uncertainty. Glimcher clearly believes that economic principles can help explain real world occurences where current science cannot. Glimcher goes beyond his own work to cite many other scientists experiments and findings that have yielded similar results to his own work. Glimcher does a good job using specific examples cited with almost every claim he makes, but some leave the reader wondering the relevance of the experiments to the claims that are supposed to support. Glimcher utilizes the history of the field to show the knowledge gaps that still exist that set the background for the necessity of his theory.Interesting Quotes\\"Until the 1970's very few neurobiologists had attempted to conceptualize neural function with regards to the kind of goals that both behavioral ecologists and experimental economists were beginning to employ in their research.\\"\\"The behavioral data produced by animals in these experiments, and in others like them, suggest that subjects never really perform optimally.\\"\\"Throughout this book I have argued that the limitations of classical dualism and physiological monism both stem from the inability of determinate mathematical tools to describe behavior in all its complexity.\\"RecommendationThis book is not for the faint of heart, especially from an economic standpoint due to the use of complex theories such as Bayes' theorem and stochastic differential equations. As such, I would be hesitant to widely recommend this book based almost entirely on the difficulty of the read. Only those who are truly passionate and that are well versed in both neuroscience and economics will really find satisfaction. The book offers a wide range of interesting elements but eventually comes up short on meshing the neuroscience with the economics. At many points throughout the book, references to experiments or stories to explain different phenomena were not helpful in dually defining the role of both neuroscience and economics. I realize that Glimcher really believes that neuroeconomics may be the future for explaining complex decision making behaviors, but very little is done in his book, to use the author's words, to \\"Put It All Together.\\" While I found this a difficult read and therefore did not fully enjoy it, there were many examples to learn from Glimcher and for some this may be enough to salvage the book."},{"Title":"The American Airport","review":"For those who love airports and airplanes, this is a wonderful book to have.

They must flee the snowstorms of deadly winter, controlled by the Fenris wolf, to seek the hidden land of Lorn.

It reads like the script of a Tim Burton movie, and the artwork is reminiscent of the art of Burton's films. My only complaint is that the story lacks closure. The reader must decide how the narrative ends on his or her own. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this work, and I would highly recommend it for everyone (over the age of ten, of course)."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"Gorey's The Hapless Child may appear to be a children's book at first glance, but this is hardly the case. Upon opening the plum-purple cover, you will find a genre savvy and witty piece of dark humor. Obviously, Gorey had to read a lot of Victorian literature to come up with this idea; The Hapless Child reads like a parody of an old orphan story in the vein of Oliver Twist or Jane Eyre. The book itself follows a little girl named Charlotte Sophia, who suffers many dramatic hardships in rapid succession, leading to her eventual death. But don't be fooled by this dark sounding summery; The Hapless Child never truly takes itself seriously, and mocks the forlorn orphan subgenre viciously and humorously. The language that Gorey uses is very old fashioned sounding, and reads as if a sarcastic English Gentleman from the 1800s were telling you the tale. Charlotte Sophia's life is made morbid and dark to ridiculous levels; in fact, it makes Oliver Twist look like \\"Goodnight Moon\\". Unlike protagonists in Victorian Orphan novels, Charlotte Sophia does not get a happy ending, which is more than likely what would have happened in the rigidly structured Victorian society.One of the most interesting features of this book is the way the illustrations and text work together. With minimal wording and big, lush black and white illustrations, The Hapless Child takes on the guise of a children's book, but it is so much more than that. The text is short and scarce because it is not the primary storyteller: Gorey's illustrations are. And they do the job just fine. Because of their detail, the pictures by themselves tell a sequential story, the way a comic book would. While the words themselves help to clarify some of the stories details, the pictures themselves show all that can possibly be shown visually. This combination of picture and text makes for a fun and interesting reading experience."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"I really like the way that this book is presented. I like that there was a picture on every page. It was actually very nostalgic because it did remind me of the way children's books are written and illustrated. I think that the pictures play a very important role in this book. To me, the illustrations are almost more important than the words themselves. Without the pictures, I do not think that the satire would be as clear or delivered as effectively. I think this book is a very good example of the use of graphic novels to help educate and learn about different stories. Studying the pictures really helps in learning the story and what the story is actually about. I felt like it is delivered in a child like way, but possesses a deeper meaning that requires closer reading. I am not a huge fan of the graphic novel or comic book, but I really enjoyed the visual rhetoric of this book. I really enjoyed the satire Gorey uses, especially in the ending of the story. The first time I read it, I never saw the ending coming. I think it is delivered very effectively. I feel like Gorey's personality is very dry, somewhat creepy humor and I think this really shows in The Hapless Child. I think that he delivers his satire in such a perfect way. I have never read satire that is that well executed in quite a while. I do not think that this book would be able to exist without the use of satire. I think if he had not written it the way he did, it would have failed."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"I bought this as a required text for a class, and looked at its cover for weeks puzzled over to what exactly it entailed. What precisely was I to read? Who was the intended audience: children, teens, adults, or all or none of the above? Now having read it, I can safely say I'm still not entirely sure. It's a fascinating book, without any particular pre-made niche to fill that I'm aware of. (Of course, I could just be in the dark here.)The 64 page tale of Charlotte Sophia's increasingly miserable life is a delight, be it for schadenfreude or the sheer ridiculousness of how dark the content gradually becomes. Inversing the typical \\"orphan becomes fabulously wealthy socialite\\" tale, poor innocent Charlotte's descent from grace uses irony for simultaneously horrific and comedic effect. At one point, I found myself actually wondering how far Gorey was willing to go, and actually laughed when the obvious set-up for Charlotte's fate is seemingly avoided only for other horrible things to persistently make her life miserable in other ludicrous manners.What stands out most of all is Gorey's visuals, instrumental in setting tone and setting. The use of color-devoid darkness and light throughout the picture book makes for haunting and surreal imagery while still keeping tones contradictorily light-hearted and heavy-handed at the same time. It's certainly an interesting read, one I'd recommend for someone looking for something different."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"Edward Gorey's The Hapless ChildPublished: November 16, 2011The first thing that one notices when setting eyes on the book The Hapless Child is how small it is. Although it comes in many different versions, it is easy to tell that this novel will be a short and easy read. It may be easy, but the actual context of the book is deep.The author, Edward Gorey, uses both text and pictures to get his story across throughout the book. It is a nice change to have pictures in book because there aren't many picture books outside of the children's section in the library. By combining the use of text and pictures when storytelling, Gorey allows the reader to interpret the story in a different way.The interesting use of pictures and text within the story makes Edward Gorey unique. They seem to work together in perfect harmony to allow the reader to understand the story fully. Although both the pictures and the texts may stand alone, the have more power when they are used properly together like in The Hapless Child.The Hapless Child is a sad story with dark and ominous themes. The young child, Charlotte Sophia, lived a wonderful life with her parents when series of events led to her unfortunate downfall. She encounters many people along her life journey and just when you think that the story is going to take a turn for the better, it doesn't. The ending leaves the reader hanging with no clues to what happens next.Edward Gorey writes in a way that sets him aside from many other authors. Most authors write in a way that finishes with a happy ending. Gorey tends to focus more upon the gloom and doom style of writing. There always seems to be a dark shadowing following Charlotte Sophia throughout the story. If you look closely, maybe you can find it hidden in the pictures.The Hapless Child is a very powerful story written by Edward Gorey. The elements that he uses work together to create a perfect storyline. He seems to use just enough detail without drowning the reader in words. His use of intertextuality allows a fun and simple way of reading a story and is perfect small read to get the mind thinking about the possible downfalls and obstacles one may encounter in life. His strange use of humor among his satires make readers only want more of Edward Gorey and his unique writing styles."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"This is one of Gorey's best stories, about the sad life of a sickeningly sweet orphan. Some people might prefer &quot;The Gashlycrumb Tinies&quot;, but I think &quot;The Hapless Child&quot; is superior. This book is the epitome of Gorey's weird style, a parody of Victorian fiction, and always funny in a gruesome way, or gruesome in a funny way, depending on how you look at it. &quot;The Hapless Child&quot; is also collected in the first &quot;Amphigorey&quot; collection, but any serious collector of Goriana will have to own this edition as well."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"I got my copy of A Hapless Child without really knowing the story. I have been familiar with Edward Gorey's books for some time, and this one appealing because of the exquisite drawings. When I read the book, I was expecting a happy conclusion. I was taken in by the Hollywood standard of not killing off your hero. Certainly, the last two pages are both shocking and oddly humorous at the same time. I had to remember that Mr. Gorey was foremost a satirist with a tilt toward the macabre. In The Hapless Child he takes on Victorian novels like Oliver Twist where orphans have a miserable time until their lives are turned around by some rich distant relative or (as with Mr. Gorey's story) are discovered by a parent thought to be dead.The Hapless Child was out-of-print for several years. This re-issue by Pomegranate is very good. The drawings are beautifully reproduced, the paper is superb and the binding and covers are meant to last."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"The funniest tragedy ever written. With illustrations. I have owned, and loaned out or given, several copies. Lately, I've had to rely upon Amphigory to supply my bile. Now it's back again in a single volume! The perfect gift for weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and birthdays!"},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"I bought this book for a college literature class, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. While at first the book looks like a simple child's tale, I found the picture book to be very adult in nature. It's the story of a young girl struggling out on the streets during old Victorian times. This little girl endures so much pain that the ending is near inconceivable. Surely a happy ending will be waiting around the corner... But this is a book by Edward Gorey.Aside from the actual words within the book, Gorey also gives his readers detailed images for each page. Each illustration contains at least one ghoulish creature, only adding to the book's whimsy. Each illustration is painstakingly detailed, and very gothic. It's a fun read for any adult who's tired of the same old 'happily ever after' tales, but most definitely not a children's book!"},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"This book is just awesome. I bought this for my daughter. I read it, laughed, and realized I would never read this to a small child. It's so miserable it's funny. The drawings are morbidly beautiful, the story is tragic and hilarious, Edward Gorey is like the Tim Burton of adult children's books."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"This is the first book I ever read by Gorey. After becoming a bit of a fan and exploring his writings further, I think this story holds up as having the best narrative and shock value. A great little yarn and a must for the collector."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that Gorey's work, this book included, is NOT for young children. Behind the short, concise, picture-driven narrative is a pitch-black Gothic tale of suffering, loss, and woe. It tells the sad, short story of a happy, little girl born to a wealthy family and the series of increasingly terrible events which befall the poor child, ending in ultimate tragedy. In truth, though, the story is an artfully done parody of rag-to-riches stories, particularly novels in the \`orphan story' and \`coming of age' subgenres, such as Jane Eyre and Oliver Twist. The many misfortunes heaped on Charlotte Sofia, Gorey's protagonist, conversely mirrors the familiar tales of poor, miserable orphans obtaining wealth and a loving family. In the context of the satire, the story is quite enjoyable, even humorous as every unhappy turn of events highlights the ludicrous nature of the turns of fortune. The illustrations are beautifully rendered and serve primarily to tell the story, the text only clarifying and expanding somewhat upon the dark, Gothic images that dominate each page. It is an enjoyable little tale that I highly recommend, if the reader is mature enough to handle it's tongue-and-cheek macabre plot."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"In this story, Gorey tells the story of little Charlotte Sophia. At first glance, the story looks harmless... like something one would read to their children right before bed. However, this book as a bedtime story is sure to leave young people in tears. Gorey appeals to emotions various times in the story. The way he chooses to dress Charlotte Sophia in white screams at readers to look to the character as a pure and innocent; so innocent in fact, readers want to feel sympathy for her when the series of unfortunate events occur in her life. The extent that Gorey goes to in order to make the events as traumatizing as possible adds a little dark humor to the story. It's as if he was thinking \\"Oh, if you thought that was bad, wait until you find out about this....\\"This is an easy read. It's short, has simply vocabulary, and great illustrations. The story also has its creepy and mysterious parts to it when it comes to the critters that make their secret appearances page after page. The way Gorey structures the story to make it one sentence per page, also makes it an easy read. It also adds suspense to the story. It's truly a page turner! (Pun intended) Gorey also does a phenomenal job reversing the popular rags-to-riches master plot. This remarkable riches-to-rags tragedy makes readers want to discover more and more of Gorey's work."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"Prior to reading this story, I had not read any of Gorey's other works, so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised (and simultaneously horrified) by the book's dark ending. It is rare for an author to kill off their main (and somewhat only) character, but Gorey does so in a fashion that is comical in its sadness. The use of illustration to accompany such a dark narrative provides an interesting contrast of childlike and mature elements, which makes for a somewhat jolting read. Also, the reversal of the common stock plot of \\"rags to riches\\" is an interesting one to read when a child is at the center. Little Charlotte Sophia's continuous bad luck is funny without being over the top, yet still sad enough to surprise and sadden a reader at her demise. Overall, Gorey's \\"The Hapless Child\\" is a darkly entertaining read, but may not be for the overly sympathetic or faint of heart."},{"Title":"Hapless Child","review":"At the beginning of the semester, when it was time to purchase course textbooks, I seen the title, The Hapless Child. I thought to myself, \\"what is this book going to be about\\"? So, at the bookstore, when I picked up the book, I looked at it and immediately thought it was a children's book, and surely when I opened it, I saw just that. So I began to wonder why my professor wanted us to read the book. At the time when the book was assigned, it amazed me of how of an easy-read the book was and how well I enjoyed the book.The Hapless Child is not just an ordinary book that your English professor would assign. It is one where it takes your mind to another zone. The book took me to a world where I had not explored since elementary school, and to go back and visit that time period, felt really good. Gorey was able to produce a book, that not only young readers would enjoy, but for older readers to enjoy as well. His ability to write a sad story, but not too sad, amazed me. The usage of the black and white illustrations, makes the story seem as if it was written years and years ago, even though it was written in 1989. The idea of only using one line per page, really stands out, obviously because the story is so simple, it only takes one line to tell the story of the accompanying picture. Another element that caught my eye was the fact that each page had a different creature hiding in the background. This added suspense for each page. After each page I turned, I was eager to find out what the next page had in store. With each page, however, I watched her world crumble beneath her as all of the possible horrors of life came to pass and she was so helpless to do anything about it. Overall this was a great book and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to explore a different genre of literature!"},{"Title":"GREAT NORTH TRAIL, THE","review":"If you are a student of the American West you will be both disappointed and completely charmed by this work. Part of the American Trail Series edited by A.B. Guthrie, Jr. , this is less about The Great North Trail and its happenings as it is a series of very interesting stories about the American West. The book starts with the traditional land bridge between Russia and Alaska that in theory lasted from 200 million years up to roughly 10,000 years ago. Across this bridge and down the Rocky Mountains to Mexico and points south Dan Cushman describes the anthropology of early man and their descendants.Next the author fast forwards to Coronado and the Spanish period, searching for Zuni in Kansas, and from there the reader is on a wild tear across the West delving into things one never reads about: Spanish ranches in Wyoming that predate Lewis and Clark, a gold rush in British Columbia, the gold trails of Montana and cattle trails from Texas. Along the way one meets the outlaws Billy the Kid and Henry Plumber, cattle baron Print Olive, Blood Chief Calf Shirt, the booziest Indian of them all and Cattle Kate, the first woman ever lynched (she rustled some, they say). Cushman finally winds up with the Klondike Gold Rush and Prohibition.This book is about the settlement of the American West, but from the West's more interesting, darker, seamy side. It is about multiple gold rushes and their impact on very transient, unstable population centers; about theft, the taking of things away from other men like land, gold or cattle; and about booze, the quite necessary lubricant that eased the fatigues of search and helped rationalize the mind. But most of all it is about the brash bawdy early American West.It is a well written good book you will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Many people read the Gospels as accurate descriptions of the life of Jesus, assuming that the Gospels accurately report what happened and do not omit any significant teachings of Jesus or events in his life. Since the late 1700's, historical criticism has challenged the accuracy of the New Testament portrayal of Jesus, thus beginning the First Quest for the historical Jesus. We are now in the Third Quest, which begin in the 1970's following the decline of Bultmannian existentialism. As in the first two Quests, the Third Quest offers an interesting array of novel interpretations and conservative responses.Ben Witherington set forth to chronicle the Third Quest in THE JESUS QUEST (1995). Witherington, a moderately conservative NT scholar with an impressive list of publications, is certainly up to the job. This book is more than just a survey of the various big names associated with the Third Quest (Crossan, Borg, Sanders, etc.). Witherington also discusses these writers within the larger issues that have dominated the Third Quest (particularly eschatology, Judaism, and social life in Galilee). Also, he introduces readers to lesser-known studies such as Graham Twelftree's JESUS THE EXORCIST. Simply put, this book is informative on many levels.The Third Quest shows signs of winding down. Books without end are still written about Jesus, but radically new approaches are hard to come by. So while Witherington's book came out ten years ago, it isn't as out of date as it might seem. Of the books that have appeared since then, my favorites are: McKnight, A NEW VISION FOR ISRAEL; Allison, JESUS OF NAZARETH: MILLENARIAN PROPHET; and Twelftree, JESUS: THE MIRACLE WORKER."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of &quot;Third Quest&quot; Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Dr. Witherington's fair and just survey of Jesus, the multitude of material written about him and his opposition to the Jesus Seminar seems to be causing discomfort for some. Whenever Biblical scholars interpret Scripture without using a variety of the tools (including historical data accepted by the majority of the world) they obviously must also have a &quot;secret&quot; agenda. Why also will they not welcome a mixture of scholars from a variety of institutions and nations?? Astute authors who are on their toes critique their peers.Aside from this book I have also read several of his other books Christology of Jesus, Jesus the Sage, and find that his commentaries continually hit the mark. Dr. Witherington is a noteworthy New Testament scholar who has written some excellent books on women in the New Testament as well!"},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"The Jesus Quest was written by New Testament scholar Ben Witherington III. Witherington is quite conservative in his conclusions and (although I do not agree with everything he puts forth in this book) his scholarship seems to be even-handed. The purpose of this book is to survey the different portraits of Jesus championed by various scholars during the start (this book was written in 1995) of the \\"Third Quest\\" for the historical Jesus. The major scholars whose portraits Witherington samples are Crossan, Borg, Sanders, Theissen, Dunn, Wright, Vermes and Meier.What makes this book so useful is the way Witherington handles the material of his fellow scholars. He is very fair in his assessments and always seems to be attentive to their own respective conclusions. Moreover, Witherington doesn't regurgitate the conclusions of each scholar and show where he disagrees with them. Rather, he carefully tracks their methodology and demonstrates how they arrived at their (some idiosyncratic) conclusions. One thing that becomes apparent is that many scholars are guilty of creating Jesus in their own image. The reader will come away from this book more enlightened on how crucial a historian's methodology is and where exactly it comes into play regarding Jesus research.I recommend this book to any individual who is interested in the current quest for the historical Jesus or is interested in the historical Jesus period. It is a very helpful survey and the reader will without a doubt come away with a better understanding of historical Jesus studies."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"I'm only one third through the book, but it's hard work just chugging through it. I'm not a NT scholar, but I'm doing a lot of research about Jesus, and have read about 20 books by different scholars. Ben Witherington, like most other scholars, has his own point of view, which he flags as the only correct one. The truth is, nothing can be proven right or wrong about the person Jesus and his disciples. It can only be assumed. Nothing was written by Jesus or his disciples. The first known writings were by Paul, who never even met Jesus, and was written 20 years after Jesus' death. Ben Witherington has an arrogant and self-righteous style which can only fully be appreciated by die-hard Christians.However, the book does have some interesting facts about Palestine at jesus' time. It also has introduced me to the books of other other scholars, like Crossan and Meier, and I look forward to reading a couple of their books. So far none of the scholars I have read seem to have found the real Jesus. Everyone is romoting their own. And the truth is, we will never ever know who he really was.Also, the fact that only the 5 and 4 star reviews are judged as \\"helpful\\" proves my point: this book is only for die-hard Christians."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Ben Witherington III's &quot;The Jesus Quest&quot; is a conservative appraisal of recent studies into the historical Jesus up to 1995. It covers many of today's most well known historical Jesus scholars (Crossan, Sanders, Vermes, Wright, Meier, Borg) and some not so well-known (Maurice Casey, Markus Bockmuehl and R. David Kaylor). It also covers the Jesus Seminar (given a chapter all to itself). What this latter point tells me is that Witherington has polemic in store (at least for his opponents). So, firstly, I would say that this book is being rhetorical and political: it wants to stake out ground and set terms, aiming to count in or out of court various procedures and arguments about the historical Jesus. A further thing one picks up from the way the book is laid out (usually two or three scholars are grouped together under a single heading, such as Vermes and Borg under the heading &quot;Jesus, Man of the Spirit&quot;) is that this way of laying out the book's contents is not really very effective. Its all too compressed and the discussions are inevitably curtailed just when you are getting interested. Further, common topics for groups of scholars don't usually work because the headings don't fit. Borg's Jesus is somewhat more than a &quot;Man of the Spirit&quot; (and Schussler Fiorenza's, detailed later in the book, is somewhat more than a &quot;sage&quot;, in context at least).When Witherington is addressing his opponents (the Jesus Seminar, Crossan and Burton Mack especially) he comes across as hard and ultra critical. One would imagine that these scholars are beyond redemption. Here we have a measure of a &quot;Yes, but&quot; approach such that the reader begins to wonder if the author wants us to find such scholars' constructions of Jesus false and misleading at the cost of asking catalogues of petty questions (as he does with Crossan, for example). I think Witherington could have been more even handed here (although he has every right to find fault where he will. Its just that readers may take a different point of view and find against the author). Crossan, after all, has written books that no historical Jesus scholar can ignore.I found this book a tad simplistic. It resorted to polarisation too much when it could have been more nuanced and synthetic, looking to build what is good in all studies into a creative whole. But Witherington has a taken a polemical tack instead. Certainly, this book should at least be read alongside Marcus Borg's &quot;Jesus in Contemporary Scholarship&quot; because that will provide the balance this book needs. Maybe Witherington should settle for less polemic next time and concentrate on providing more constructive analysis."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Ben Witherington has a distinguished list of publications to his credit, so it comes as a surprise to find that this volume lacks much of the scholarship for which he is known. He claims to survey the major views of Jesus in this 3rd quest (e.g., cynic, escatological prophet, social reformer, sage), however, he ignores three of the main views (ie., magician ala Morton Smith; Essene ala Barbara Thiering; Pagan composite ala Tim Freke and Peter Gandy). Such an omission raises questions about the objectivity of this book, and a cursory reading of the text confirms any misgiving you may have - this is a highly personal and subjective book. Here are some examples of this approach...\\"In its statement of purpose, found conveniently in the back of its [the Jesus seminar] red-letter edition...\\" (p. 43)\\"...Crosson is, if anything, in this latest book even more dogmatically against...\\" (p. 91)\\"...and Funk, Crosson and their kin...\\" (p. 79)You can see in the choice of words (\\"their kin\\", \\"conveniently\\", \\"dogmatically\\", etc) that this is hardly an objective or scholarly piece.In addition, there are many errors. For example,He claims \\"One of the earliest pictorial renderings of Jesus is found in Rome. It is on a 4th Century sarcophagus...(p. 59).\\" That simply isn't true. There are renderings going back to the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, so 4th Century is hardly earliest.He claims \\"The frequency, immediacy and approach of his [Jesus] cures distinguish them from a number of other ancient miracle stories. (p. 70).\\" Also not true. Any reader of Smith or Freke and Gandy knows this assertion is false.He claims \\"There are six exorcism stories, 17 healings and 8 nature miracles in the Gospel tradition. (p. 71).\\" By whose count??? There are 18 healings in Mark alone, and another 9 in Matthew that aren't mentioned in Mark, and 5 in Luke that aren't in Mark or Matthew, etc.He claims \\"...especially in view of the two volume nature of Luke's work.\\" (p. 228). Excuse me, isn't that a theory, not a fact? Indeed, there are some serious questions whether or not Acts (I'm assuming this is the 2nd volume of which he speaks) was written by 1 person or isn't the account of 2 different people, spliced together to make 1 story. And then, of course, there are so many instances of plagurism in Luke, one wonders whether or not it is fair to say that \\"Luke\\" \\"wrote\\" it at all, but rather \\"compiled\\" might be a more accurate word.I could go on, but you get the point.Notable omissions, personal attacks and numerous errors make this book less valuable than it might have been. It certainly covers a lot of ground and generally speaking gives a good introduction to those areas where Witherington doesn't show his biases."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Witherington states that he is presenting a synopsis and commentary of biblical scholars who are on the &quot;Third Quest&quot; for the historical Jesus. What he fails to mention until the latter half of the book is that he considers himself one of the Third Questers who has his own interpretation of the historical Jesus. This revelation immediately places into question the validity of his critiques of the other questers. Without personal knowledge of the thought of the scholars presented, the reader has no way of knowing whether Witherington has adequately, much less accurately, presented their positions. The book is useful in helping the reader to appreciate the vast number of theories circulating about the historical Jesus, but the reader must read Witherington's critiques in light of his hidden agenda."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"I don't get the book delivered yet. Could you please reprocess this delivery?Grant"},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Witherington's book disappoints because it tantalizes the reader intoexpecting a transcending view of the historical-Jesus controversy,but in fact it is merely another partisan effort. You will like it if youalready accept that the Gospels are blandly historical; or, asWitherington hopefully avers in the foreword, if you already believethat Christ is reigning in glory and only waiting for you to notice. Butfor that matter, sermons are much cheaper than hardcover books,and are available in churches all across the land every Sunday."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Witherington outlines the many different views of the Jesus Quest on who Jesus was and cites a few authors for each view. He just goes a little too far in trashing the opinions of his fellow scholars (many of which are better than him). The most valuable part of this book was the list of authors he has in his table of contents. Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, Burton Mack, E.P. Sanders, Geza Vermes, Gerd Thiessen, Richard Horsley, Elizabeth Scussler Fiorenza, and the Jesus Seminar. Read these authors instead of wasting your time reading about what Witherington THINKS about each of them."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Ben Witherington III, himself a highly competent &quot;Jesus scholar,&quot; here provides an extremely helpful overview of recent &quot;Jesus scholarship&quot; as of 1995. His exposition and critique will help the newcomer to sort through a bewildering array of theories and sources.I have read almost all of the authors he discusses, and I can say that his presentations of their views are accurate and fair. Frankly, I have never been able to take the &quot;Jesus seminar,&quot; John Dominic Crossan, or Elisabeth Schussler-Fiorenza very seriously, but Witherington manages to do so for just long enough to decimate their theories and methods. And he doesn't seem to be snickering behind his hand while he does it (which is more than I would have been able to manage). Ever the gentleman, the only jest he allows himself at their expense is in the title of his chapter on the &quot;Jesus seminar&quot;: &quot;Jesus the Talking Head.&quot;The other reviews have already listed some of the major scholars whose views he presents. Again, his summaries are thorough and accurate and his criticisms usually well-founded, from the noneschatological, compassion-mongering &quot;spirit person&quot; of Marcus Borg to the slightly-too-eschatological &quot;God's viceroy&quot; of E.P. Sanders, from the Galilean hasid of Geza Vermes to the marginal Jew of John P. Meier. In most cases he finds something (sometimes a very great deal) worth keeping in each scholar's account but takes pains not to _reduce_ the historical Jesus to any one of his aspects.Moreover, he helpfully includes several lesser-known scholars in his overview -- Graham Twelftree, Richard Horsley, R. David Kaylor, and Maurice Casey, for example. Of course it is simply not possible for a single volume to be complete in this respect (and I especially wish he had been able to deal with Stevan Davies's _Jesus the Healer_), but Witherington has managed to compress a great deal of scholarship into a single book.His own view, also presented here, is that Jesus is best viewed as (primarily but not exclusively or reductively) an embodiment of &quot;Wisdom&quot; (chochmah). The reader should refer to Witherington's _Jesus the Sage_ for a more complete presentation of this view (which, to my own admittedly non-Christian mind, has the twin advantages of (a) not rendering Jesus different in kind from other human beings and (b) placing him somewhat correctly within his Jewish context although I personally suspect the nearly-equivalent &quot;embodiment of Torah&quot; might have made slightly better historical-contextual sense).Of course there have been books published since 1995 that are not included here either -- by, for example, Bart Ehrman, Dale Allison, and Paula Fredriksen (whose earlier _From Jesus to Christ_ is also not discussed). However, the reader who has assimilated all of Witherington's material will be well-equipped to deal with these further volumes as well."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"John Meier said in the introduction to Vol. 1 of A Marginal Jew that &quot;there are enough 'Jesus books' to last three lifetimes.&quot; Simply reading Meier's work nearly uses up one of these lives.Enter Professor Witherington, who is not only well aquainted with the scholarly (and not so scholarly) works written by Third Questers, but is also well-respected by biblical scholars with diverse theological commitments. In this work, Witherington summarizes the contributions of over 20 authors, including himself, offering both commendation and criticism.As an evaluator of others' works, Witherington is fair and judicious. He is certainly not shy about offering criticism concerning other scholars' methodology and hermeneutic, but he showcases both the positives and the negatives. The other reviewer who said that Witherington &quot;trashes&quot; other scholars would do well to read chapter 7. As much as Witherington disagrees with Fiorenza's thesis, that Jesus was a prophet of Sophia, he does in fact voice affirmation of her conclusions more than a few times, including agreeing that Jesus was seeking change in the Jewish patriarchal system (pg. 165). On the other hand, having a great admiration of Meier's work didn't keep him from questioning Meier's assumptions concerning &quot;decades of liturgical adaptation, etc..&quot; leaving their mark on the four Gospels. (pg. 200).A minor critique-this book is a good place to begin a study of Third Quest Jesus scholarship, but I would also recommend reading a work that details some of the criteria used by historical critics in evaluating the authenticity of Jesus' sayings(ie. multiple attestation, dissimilarity, etc.). Witherington briefly discusses criteria and method (pg. 46-47), but not in great detail. In his end notes he points the reader to another one of his works, The Christology of Jesus, for a fuller treatment.Minor quibbles aside, this work is a needed service to those who stand intimidated by the mountain of material that modern Jesus scholarship has produced. Dr. Witherington's careful commentary on contemporary contributors gives one confidence and direction for one interested in Third Quest studies."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"For over two centuries, theologians and Biblical scholars have attempted to sift through the historical texts that bear witness to the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, in order to discover what the &quot;Historical Jesus&quot; was actually like. In this comprehensive yet accessible study, Ben Witherington presents and analyzes the portraits of Jesus put forth by some of the most current scholars in the field of Jesus research. This includes the more radical views of Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza, as well as more traditional views voiced by N. T. Wright, John Meier, and Witherington himself. In my opinion, the book deserves to be read by all serious Christians, in order that they may know and appreciate the many interpretations of Jesus that have come about. This book will challenge, enrich, and stimulate anyone who knows (or wants to know) about Jesus of Nazareth."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"ben witherington is a conservative evangelical who has written many works on nt theology. this book on the &quot;third quest: ( a term first used by tom wright to describe the resurgence of interest in the historical jesus in the past few decades; the first quest started in the mid 1800's with renan and ended with the works of schweitzer ). in this work, witherington examines the works of notable scholars in the field, including crossan, borg, sanders, wright, meier, schussler-fiorenza, theissen, horsley, vermes, and raymond brown. while witherington is polite, fair, and essentially accurate in his critiques, he does use his viewpoint as the measuring stick, making this work biased but still very good. he is quite kind to nt wright as well as jp meier (whose work A MARGINAL JEW )is considered to be the best work on the subject available today. he is much less so to the jesus seminar as well as elizabeth schussler fiorenza (who are on the far left in the debate). one reviewer said that one should read the individual works and truly ther is no substitute for this; but this book was not wriien for the advanced scholar. overall, this work will be of most value to conservative christians who want a good introduction to the various authors in the field."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Witherington definitely has his own agenda, I wouldn't deny that. However, some of these previous reviewers seem to believe that some books come to be inside an opinion vacuum. to them: EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN AGENDA!! Witherington puts forth a study of the Jesus Quest that I found helpful and quite enlightening. My largest criticism of Witherington's book is that it is difficult to read."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Witherington carefully critiques what scholars are saying about the Son of God. And then he presents a positive biblical portrait of the Savior. Written for the evangelical community. But important and accessible to all."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"This really is the very best review of all the recent biblical scholarship on the market. Nothing I've read even comes close to it, in fact.Witherington examines all the important books written on the quest for the historical Jesus for about the last fifty years. He gives a fair summation of each author's main arguments, and then goes on to give the main criticisms that have been leveled as well.Interested in finding out the differences between Burton Mack and Robert Funk? Witherington explains that Funk believes \\"that the earliest window on Jesus is to be found in the hypothetically reconstructed Q (and in particular its earliest strata) and in the earliest form of the Gospel of Thomas\\" (p 272.)Burton Mack is yet another advocate for the Cynic Jesus. Witherington points out how questionable it is that Hellenization had reached small outposts in Galilee, and that the evidence we have is that \\"Jesus seems to have avoided the cities\\" (p 61) except Jerusalem.This book is indispensable for anyone interested in biblical research. Go out and get it!"},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, I do not see the author as polemic or unfair. He provides reasonable arguements to back his claims. Perhaps he is somewhat harsh on Marcus Borg, but his arguements with the Jesus Seminar are certainly shared by many others (such as Meier). There are only two criticisms I would have: the writing is not as engaging as authors like Meier or Vermes and the book's value primarily would be to those who have read a fair number of the texts he references. To get a picture of Jesus just from this book and biblical accounts would be a mistake."},{"Title":"The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth","review":"Solid introduction to current issues in historical Jesus scholarship. Witherington is a bright conservative scholar and his criticisms should not be ignored. He covers alot of ground in this book. Obviously he does not intend to go into too much detail as he surveys contributions from quite a few scholars -- sometimes covering two or more in one chapter. For more detailed argumentation on many of the issues in this book, one would need to consult his various commentaries and works on the historical Jesus."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],J={key:0},C={key:1};function D(s,e,n,m,r,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",C,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",J,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(B,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-0ee59481"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/28.md","filePath":"drive/28.md"}'),j={name:"drive/28.md"},R=Object.assign(j,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{E as __pageData,R as default};
