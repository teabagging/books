The authors do not cover chicken. Liked the stories and some of the recipies."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"With all of the different cuts of meat available today, it is easy to be confused about what to buy and how to cook it. I was particularly interested in how to bring out the flavor and tenderness in some of the cheaper cuts. So I bought this book, and it didn't disappoint. Not only do the authors explain everything under the sun about how to choose and buy meat and which cuts work best with different types of cooking methods, but they also provide scores of delicious recipes. For most types of meat, they will give you a \\"master recipe\\" outlining the basics, and then a range of flavor/sauce variations. The recipes range from good to excellent-- they call for a nice variety of ingredients, but they are not by any means overly-sophisticated or inaccessible. Lisa's Lazy Pot Roast is the best pot roast I've ever made.The book has also introduced me to methods for improving my execution of dishes I was already familiar with. Thanks to the authors, my stovetop porkchops are much juicier than they had been before. The temperature doneness chart alone almost justifies the price of the book-- I'm constantly referring to it whether or not I'm using one of the book's recipes. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves meat and wants to broaden their horizons in this area."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"...A couple of the recipes may seem outrageous but if you give them a shot you will be completely converted. The best thing about the book is it's recogition of the fact that we are not cooking the same meat that our parents cooked with. Also Bruce and Dennis' insistance on the usage of a digital instant-read thermometer was a real revelation for me. ... My whole attitude toward dealing with larger cuts of meat has completely changed for the good. The larger cuts also enable me to cook more economically for my family and we always have exceptional leftovers. I cook out of this book twice a week right now and I have never had a disappointing recipe."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I was never a big meat eater, but my husband is. I didn't understand the different cuts and didn't make meat dishes often, sticking to chicken and ground beef with the occassional pork chop and steak. This cook book is great at demystifying the meat counter. Each section starts with a diagram of the animal and an explanation of the different cuts (including all the synonyms)and cooking methods, followed by recipes to best use those cuts. An easy to follow, thorough recipe format and personal tone make this an easy, interesting book to read. There is good variety in the recipes and you can easily make substitutions if necessary. The pot roast recipe is the best I've ever had, anywhere. I highly recommend this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I was shocked to see the few negative reviews. Disregard them and give this book a try. It really IS a definitive guide with lots of information on the different cuts of meat, and recipes for brines, marinades, rubs, sauces, etc. I could easily cook all my meat only from the recipes in this book. These guys really know their meat. The book also has many amusing anecdotes and a totally non-intimidating feel. I have made about 10 of the recipes (pork chops, pork loin roast, braciole, lamb kebabs, pot roast, round steak, etc) and loved them all. I only had trouble with Braciole because I couldn't get the meat pounded out properly. It looked weird but was real tasty. Anyway, read it and start cooking!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Everything I have made from this cookbook has turned out delicious. The crown roast of pork will make you weak in the knees! And the roasted winter vegetables that goes with it..heaven. It has a wealth of information that you will return to over and over again. A wonderful cookbook and an excellent reference book."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is one of the finest cookbooks for anyone who has shunned a vegan lifestyle. The marinades and dry rub recipes are worth the price of the book alone, and to be frank, I haven't had one mediocre meal from this cookbook.Bruce Aidells makes his livelyhood as a meat packer and sausage maker. In this book you become very aware that he loves his work.Buy the book! You will be very pleased with the meals that come from it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This not only gives you recipes; it gives you information on how to select the best cuts of meat. That is really the secret ingredient to a great roast or steak, etc. The Lazy day roast recipe is a never fail, impress your in-laws, most requested recipe I have ever tried. This is one of my most favorite and most frequently used cookbooks. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"\\"The Complete Meat Cookbook\\" has a wonderful amount of information on cuts, cooking techniques and so on which is great for a person like me who doesn't know much in the ways of meat. I also really like the little factoids at the top of the page that mentions if a certain recipe is: \\"fast recipe\\", \\"great for leaftovers\\", \\"low-fat\\", etc. What I didn't realize is that the book doesn't cover fish and chicken (which was a mistake on my part for not reading the cover carefully). Also, I wish this book had a picture for most to all of the recipes they feature in the book. I like seeing the end result before I buy all the ingredients. Hindsight 20/20 I don't think I would have bought this book and gone with something with a broader scope and more attention to detail."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I purchased this book for myself a few years ago and have cooked through a large portion of it. I love to cook and am quite critical of recipes I choose to explore. There has not been a single recipe that my family did not LOVE. They are simple to moderate recipes in the collection. From the simple side, we LOVE the pork chops with pineapple sauce served with rice. The Matambre is fantastic! My personal favorite is the Lambshanks...Amazing and simple. How about cuban pork sandwiches or Carnitas. Try Stuffed fresh ham instead of turkey for the holidays. Recipes are easy to follow and authors give flavor options to change up the recipes by using dry rub options or marinades. I love this book so much that it is the first gift selection for any wedding I attend and I think I have given a dozen out as gifts for various family and friends! Bon apetit!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I was sooooo disappointed with my butcher who told me the cut of pork I'd anticipated making a roast from was unavailable. All he had left was lowly pork shoulder!My meat purveyor came to the rescue with a recipe from this cookbook for Milk-Braised Carnitas. \\"Wow! Amazing! Fantastic! Awe-Inspiring!\\" were the words my guests used to describe the melt-in-your-mouth food-gasm that resulted.Subsequently I bought the book and have learned much from it.

In addition to all of the regular cooking techniques for &quot;standard&quot; meat cuts, this book excels in leading you to explore cuts of beef, lamb, and pork that you probably have stayed away from. When I see sales in supermarket circula's of meat that I have never tried, I pull out my &quot;bible&quot;. The result has been an introduction of many succulent cuts of meats that are new to our family and enrich our eating experience. This book also makes a super great gift to the parent who has everything! You CAN NOT go wrong with this purchase!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This book is great for pointing out the different cuts of meat and their uses. The methods used for preparation of different meats are right on target. Follow the authors recommendations for how to cook particular cuts of meat, and the results will be a success! The recipes are good too."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I was never a big meat eater but when ever I did feel like cooking meat on the grill, entertaining some friends with a nice roast or preparing a romantic meal with lamb, I was always at a loss. My meat was never comparable to anything I had when I ate out. This book has changed that. I have used eight of the recipes and every time they turned out surpassing anything I have ordered at a restaurant. The instructions on selecting and cooking meat are superb and the recipes are great."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Our household is always hosting some kind of special event, any excuse for a party. We were very excited to finally find a cookbook that speaks straightforwardly to how to cook a piece of good meat and not cook it to death. The pictures at the front part of the book are inspirational. We immediately chose our Christmas dinner menu to feature the rack of lamb wih herb and bread crumb crust. Dinners for ten and meat done perfectly thanks to the logical and simple instructions from this great book. We gave the book as gift to an avid cook and he said he stayed up late reading. Another friend who is a caterer said she has used the book for three events with great success. We also had a birthday party for about thiry and did a bar-b-que and served Nogales steak tacos (pg. 102) and the rib-eye was enhanced by the simple marinade which we've also used on top sirloin. The new book not only teaches us about meat but also gives quick and easy side dishes to make the meal complete. We are very impressed with the vast amount of information and great recipes this book offers. Every cook needs this book as a reference book and will be happy with the results of the research and knowledge that Bruce and Denis have put together."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I have now made six or seven of the recipes from this book and loved all of them (as did my husband, friends and family). The book has a particularly good collection of pork recipes, many of which involve make-ahead marinades and quick final preparation (excellent for working couples).Well-illustrated discussions of meat cuts, etc."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Upon reading this book I now understand all of the different cuts of meat, where they come from and how they are to be prepared. I have changed the way I shop and where I shop. My family can't believe the difference. I now confidently go up to the butcher and tell him which cut I want (even the rib numbers I want...they are not all the same). I can now spot bad meat a mile away and won't go near the stuff I would have previously bought. Meat is too expensive to guess at. I highly recommend this book!!!! The recipes are great too."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I love it! Someone finally has seen that there is a vast market of us in search of prime beef!~ I really think it will be very informative for the occassional cook and a reference for those of us who are looking for some fresh, but proven ways to improve our black Angus. I learn something new everytime I read, and I thought I knew just about all there is to know about meats....Ha... Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Despite trying to be a cookbook, this book is something else: A general resource on cooking meat. The recipes are somewhat disappointing, but the overall book is extremely valuable, and many of the recipes can be adapted in slight variations to make very delicious meals. It has changed the way I cook meat, but I have found the recipes to be the least valuable part of the book.One good example is the recipe for chile colorado. They include beans(!) which to my knowledge no Mexican cook would add, and they make it in the oven (which is fine, I suppose). However, I had wanted to make a more traditional stove-top chile colorado, so I took the recipe, dropped the beans, adapted it to the stove top, and it worked out nicely. I had made a couple of other modifications as well, such as the use of fresh tomatoes. In the end, I found the commentary on the recipe more helpful than the actual recipe in learning how to make this dish.Additionally the book is packed with information on cuts of meat, general cooking tips, and information about storage and treatment of meats.My recommendation is to sit down and read this book like a textbook, all the way through. Then, if you are trying a recipe, read the description carefully, compare it to the recipe, and make adjustments as you see fit. You are likely to learn a lot and your cooking is likely to change.Update: As Mr Aidells points out, I slightly misremembered the recipe. The description mentions the possibility of adding beans but the recipe mentions potatoes which is the ingredient I left out. I also added fresh tomatoes and cooked on the stove-top (I might have added tomato paste if cooking in the oven). I am also adjusting up to five stars because the other information in the book and the description of the dish which was attached to the recipe gave me the basis for adjusting the recipe to get what I wanted out of it."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is the most complete book on meat I've seen. Everything you want to know about the cuts and what cooking method they're best suited for.Every recipie is very good, right down to different wet and dry \\"rubs\\".I have learned so much from this book, and now enjoy meat I never thought I liked.You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is the bible for meat. I use this cookbook more than any other I've ever had. It is incredibly informative and easy to use. They catagorize their recipes: In a hurry, Fit for company, Mom's comfort food, etc.. You have no idea how good filet mignon or pork chops can be until you try these recipes."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This cookbook is fantastic. It provides excellent descriptions of various techniques and the reasons for them. The recipes are fantastic. This is one of those cookbooks that provide so many outstanding options that it is difficult to decide what to do. My recommendation would be to try the techniques described that you haven't done before. It will certainly open up new horizons and give you great ideas of your own. This is one of the essential cookbooks for any collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I was a bit sketpical of this book when I first picked it up. This book has been truely eye opening, and has helped to prepare several very tasty meals since I have gotton this book. This book is divided into several sections that deal with many different types of meat. This book will help you save money by knowing what cuts of meats to look for. For example, did you know that some cuts of the chuck steak are adjacent to a rib eye? Next time gives those a look when you are hungry for ribeye at a savings of at least 4 to 5 dollars a pound.The book has a wide variety of recipes ranging from the ordinary Sunday type comfort meals we all enjoy, to those that are a bit more creative. I have really enjoyed their recipes for roast, different types of hamburers, and steak. What I enjoy the most is that this book is both a recipe book, but also is educational in the sense that it takes away some of the mystery that we all have when step up to the meat counter."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This cookbook is simply fantastic and the recipes are easy to follow..You cannot ask for a better description of MEAT. Excellentto read."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I have about 70 cookbooks, 3 binders full of recipes and many copies of Gourmet, Cooks Illustrated on my shelves. This book is one I turn to time and again and it never fails me. I have had it for about 10 years, and whether it is a simple recipe for the family or one that will wow my guests, I always end up looking like a star. If I could only keep a handful of books in my collection, this is one that would come with me without a doubt. In addition to the recipes being very easy to follow, there are notes at the top of each one that indicate whether they are \\"Good for a crowd,\\" \\"Fit for company,\\" \\"Cooking on a budget,\\" \\"In a hurry,\\" \\"Low-fat,\\" \\"Great leftovers.\\" There are master recipes for many different cuts of meat, and then delicious variations that follow.

And no mention of pork belly?! Slightly disappointed, but still a good book."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I rely on this cookbook regularly. Every recipe I have tried, and I've owned this book for over 6 years, has been delicious. Some have several steps, but are many are fairly simple in terms of ingredients. I recommend this book if you love meat and like cooking, and are interested to explore different ways of cooking meat. You will be richly rewarded- I have. I just cooked the braised veal roast, and once again have been blown away by the results. Generally you can be flexible with what cut of meat you use as long as you follow their intro guideline. I moved from the US to NZ and the cuts are a bit different here, but I have no problem adapting to NZ cuts using this book. I suspect the same would be true for other countries. A leg is a leg, after all."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I purchased this through the advise of my sister-in-law, as she had the book.

I love it and use it often!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Everything -and I mean EVERYTHING- you need to know about meat: from where does it come from to how to carve it, this book is a complete marvel! Do not confuse it with any of those &quot;barbecue bibles&quot; that tell you stuff you either already know or couldn't care less (i.e. lots of no-brainer tips or cookout recipes for weekend grilling-chef dads). This is not a cookbook, this is a TREATISE (also very entertaining reading)!This book is for experts, made by experts! It describes the animals, their meat, its flavors, textures and consistency, the cuts, their handling, the cooking techniques for each and everyone of them and, needless to say, some not-your-usual-dinner exotic international recipes that'll water your mouth (it even features &quot;cochinita pibil&quot;!).Too bad it only covers beef, veal, pork and lamb! It should also include game! But ...nobody's perfect! All in all, A MUST!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"\`The Complete Meat Cookbook' by leading meat authorities Bruce Aidells and Denis Kelly is a wonderful reference cookbook for all and any foodies who really cook. The pair have written three other books, primarily on cured meats before issuing this general work.One symptom of the depth of Aidells' authoritative knowledge of meat cookery is the fact that he singlehandedly changed a long standing attitude about cooking meat and using salt. The conventional wisdom was that salt on raw meat before cooking drew out moisture from the meat and made it dry. Aidells demonstrated that salting the surface of beef before searing greatly enhanced the flavor of the cooked meat. This event was quoted, without necessarily giving credit to Aidells himself, on more than a few Food Network shows, most notably by Sara Moulton and the culinary world has changed ever since. The stature of that demonstration may be measured by the fact that the combined efforts of Harold McGee and Alton Brown, both with major forums in books and TV shows for their opinions, have not been able to stamp out the myth that searing meat \`seals in moisture'. The difference, of course, is that a good sear has other positive benefits, so the myth is an empty talking point and culinary declaimers have no reason to change their cant, since getting people to do something good, if even for the wrong reason, is beneficial in the long run. But enough of this rant on small matters.The Aidells / Kelly book can and should be compared directly to a similar book by an equally prestigious pair of authors, Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby, who published their book, \`How to Cook Meat' two years later, so they would have the advantage of reading the Aidells / Kelly book. The two books, like almost everyone else in the professional culinary world, consider \`meat' to be flesh from cows (beef from mature animals and veal from animals one year of age or less), pigs, and sheep (mutton from older animals and lamb from animals less than a year old). In truth, neither book really talks much about mutton, so the \`big four' are beef, pork, lamb and veal.Aidells/ Kelly is a bit longer in page count, but I suspect the two are about the same length, as Aidells/Kelly uses somewhat larger print and is a bit more generous with margins. Of the two, Aidells/Kelly spends much more space on talking about general cooking techniques while Schlesinger / Willoughby spends more time on individual recipes. What that means to me is that while Schlesinger / Willoughby is a better source for fast recipes to do a particular type of cooking, Aidells/Kelly gives a better overview of general cooking techniques and a better understanding of meat cooking in general. Aidells/Kelly also gives much more information on picking the right cut of meat for each recipe and for each cooking technique. As one reads a lot of different material on cooking and spends all too much time watching Alton Brown on the Food Network, one gradually learns that shoulder and rump cuts are good for braising and other slow wet cooking methods and rib and loin cuts are good for fast, dry heat cooking, but things can get a lot more complicated than that, especially when you add the the creativity of supermarket marketing types who give fancy labels to cuts of meat which may obscure the meat's source and quality.Aidells / Kelly earn their title not by giving us every known meat cooking recipe under the sun. No book short of a multivolumed encyclopedia could do that. On the other hand, the authors do a good job of providing a pretty wide range of famous recipes. Among the beef recipes, for example, they give \`beefsteak Florentine, the Philly cheese steak, barbecued beef ribs, and Italian-American meatballs. I was a bit disappointed that their \`barbecue' recipe was really just grilled marinaded beef ribs with a sweet barbecue sauce.Their claim to completeness comes from the depth of their information given before and between the recipes on general cooking techniques and how to make the best use of them. To enhance our experience in reading the book, the authors also throw in some short histories of how these three great animal families joined the human food chain and contributed to the improved health of herding tribes over the grain eaters.The authors give us a lot of other nice little tools such as labels on recipes to indicate whether they are best for quick cooking, entertaining, economy, or high leftover value. The most valuable extra may be the level of detail they give to determining whether a cooked piece of meat is \`done'.The very best aspect of the book is the number of cross references given for correlating cuts of meat with cooking methods, brines, rubs, and marinades. I was initially just a little surprised at how simple their animal butchering diagram was, in that it divided the whole carcass into no more than a half dozen primals and spoke about these basic regions as if everything from the beef round could be treated the same. But they redeemed themselves as they developed their subject and gave much more detailed treatments of more finely differentiated cuts of meat.I recommend this book very highly to anyone who enjoys reading about cooking. It is just a bit less useful to someone who simply wants a book they can grab now and then to find a new way to do pork chops of lamb shoulder. For that, the Schlesinger / Willoughy book may be slightly better, as their organization of recipes is great for fast reference."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This book is worth every dime. It stands next to Madison's _Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone_. I have yet to come across a recipe that has failed me.The information is clear and concise. The only flaw I would argue is that the recipes are not all pure basic recipes but use ingredients that the average cook of 30 years ago would not necessarily have possessed e.g., zinfandel. But if you read the information correctly a cook can figure out the basics by either reverse engineering or just plain doing (an assumption is made that you know it is okay to salt and pepper the meat).The pot roast recipe alone is worth it and so is the knowledge of brining.My only wish is that they, the authors, do a poultry book.Speaking as a person who eats at the California Culinary Institute often I would argue that the meat recipes are better than at the academy. Once you read this book you will have a very discerning knowledge of meat at home and professionally.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"The two reviewers who gave this book two stars must have gotten an alien version. This is the second book by the authors I own and think it is a wonderful addition to my library. It is concise, accurate and extremely helpful for the novice and professional alike. If I had to rate it donw at all it would be for lack of more pictures. They were wonderful and left me famished. the recipes I have tried are all outstanding. The anecdotes and stories are wonderful to read as well. There is nothing worse than a cookbook without stories. Accolades to you guys from a chef, caterer and writer."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"If you are the type of person who wants a reference book instead of a cookbook, this is the book for you. I like to use recipes as a baseline for my cooking, but I'm always wondering how long to cook this or what piece to buy. This book has the answers. Do you want to know how long to cook an 8lb pork shoulder or a slab of ribs? This book will tell you. The authors suggest using an instant read thermomether. I bought one and have never over/undercooked anything since. Everything has turned out perfect. That little tidbit alone was worth the price.I love the Master Recipes in each section. They tell you how to perfectly cook any piece of meat in any cut. If you don't know what piece of meat to buy, read the section before you go to the store and you'll know. There are ratings on each recipe like \\"Great for Leftovers\\", \\"Good for Company\\" and \\"Less Expensive Cuts.\\" They are all spot on as well.I like this book so much I gave it to my father for his birthday. He loves it.Now, I only wish they had the same books for poultry and fish. Then I'd have the only three cookbooks I'd ever need to cook perfect meat."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I've owned this book for a total of about 2 months and it has already become an irreplaceable staple in my kitchen. Every recipe I've tried has been reliable and delicious, and I've learned so much already from the instructions on how to choose, buy, and prepare difference kinds of meat. The sheer number of recipes in this book is almost mind-boggling, an effect made more profound by the incredible variety of tastes, ethnicities, and techniques represented. It'll probably take me years to try every recipe, and I doubt I'll ever get bored.They should have called this book \\"The Meat Bible\\". Because it surely is.HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews here at Amazon. I was not disappointed! I made the Tejano style lamb and the Flank Steak roll-ups for my annual barbecue and got more raves and recipe requests than I can remember in my 22 years of meat cookery! This book should be in everyone's library."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is a fabulous book. A complete education on cuts of meats and how to cook them. Can't recommend it enough. I am ordering a copy for my sister today."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"For anyone who eats meat, or just eats meat on...ahem...rare occasions, you simply must get this book. I found myself sitting down and reading it cover to cover like a novel. Fascinating information on meat production and why we need to approach today's cuts differently than our parents did. The recipes are fantastic and it is very well illustrated. You don't need any other book to discover how to best cook meat. My only complaint with it, and a very minor one, is that sometimes the way the recipes are laid out don't flow easily, what with different &quot;flavor steps&quot; and so on; I prefer a read-straight-through recipe. I recently tried out their Coca-cola barbecue sauce and was blown away by it. The way they do Mexican-style flanks steaks and cheaper cuts of meat are wonderful. Get it. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"It is refreshing to read a cook book about meat that does not apologize for appreciating our carnivorous urges. Written by unabashed fans of meat, it is an extremely well done specialty cookbook.The book begins with a description of the history of meat production in North American and how it impacts the way we need to cook meat. It then moves on to described detailed cooking methods and to which cuts of meat these methods apply. I found the advise in this section to be very valuable.Then for each of type of meat (beef, pork, lamb, veal) the book describes the type of cuts available, how to buy the best of each type of cut and how to use each cut. The come the recipes.Each recipe is broken down into the flavouring step (usually a rub or marinade) and then detailed cooking instructions. The recipes do not follow the cooking school approach of providing a master or basic recipe followed by variations. Most of the recipes stand alone, although the authors do make suggestions on where to use which rubs/marinades with which cuts of meat. In addition, the book details preparation time, appropriateness for entertaing or budget concious recipes.The recipes themselves are absolutely delicious and use readily available ingredients. I know that I often only make 2 or 3 recipes from a given cookbook. However, I have made almost every recipe from this one.Overall, this is an excellent specialty cookbook."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"I found this little gem at a yard sale in southern Oklahoma. It is an earlier Zane Grey work (1921 copyright) but it is well worth the reading. This little green hardback gave me a good contrast between what was written as western fiction then, and what is written now. The title is somewhat misleading in that the mysterious rider is not who you would think it would be. I would highly recommend it for the younger generation, boys or girls."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"On the surface, this book could be considered dull. But what one must realize, is the era in which this book was written, in the 1920's. For lack of a better way to say it, people, especially children, did not get out much back then. They needed to escape, and thinking of the wild west, was a good a way as any.I found the book very enjoyable. The book is not for children, if for no other reason, it it is not written for them, more for young adults. If you want to read a western about shootouts, and that sort of thing, then this is not your book. But for a good, descriptive drama, that grabs you and makes the pages turn, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider is the story of Columbine, a orphan girl raised by her adoptive father Rancher Bill. Out of feeling obligated to Bill, Columbine agrees to marry his son Jack who is a drunkard, gambler, and coward. But her true love is Wilson Moore, who loves her in return..... But there is one more character with a secret- Columbine's actual father....The master of Western, Zane Grey (1872-1939), brings in romance in his novels, but the insightful way he describes the geography, social customs and practices, the way of life in the West, the American Indian, cowboy, and rancher characters makes the reader so involved. The stories provide not only adventure and entertainment, but the remarkable history of the West."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"As all of the books I have read penned by Zane Grey, this one was great.

I like the descriptions of the colors and scenery in Zane Grays books, my mother didn't, she wanted to get to the \\"guts\\" of the books, but I feel more like I am watching the scene unfold. Although the endings are somewhat predictable, they are usually happy, they are the way you want them to end, but through many obstacles!I like the Trilogy Betty Zane, The Spirit of The Border and The Last Trail, these are the one's I read first and have not been disappointed in any of the Zane Grey books.

New book AmazonI recommend this book if you like western books."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"While I am a fan of Western movies, I've never been big on Western books outside of Elmore Leonard's stories (which I read not because they were Westerns, but because they were Elmore Leonard stories). In fact, just as the movie genre is a pale shadow of its former self, so is the written Western. In its heyday, however, there were few writers bigger than Zane Grey, and The Mysterious Rider shows that he handles the genre well.The story is centered around Columbine Bellounds, a nineteen-year-old girl who was adopted by wealthy rancher Bill Bellounds after she was found abandoned in Colorado ranch country. Columbine is a good step-daughter, in fact, too good; feeling she owes Bill, she agrees to his wish that she marry her step-brother Jack. The semi-incestuous nature of marrying someone who she has treated as a sibling isn't really the issue; the problem is that Jack is a rather loathsome character.Bill wants the wedding to take place because he thinks only Columbine can reform Jack, and she almost believes it herself, despite his constant acts of cruelty. Complicating matters is that she loves another, the cowboy Wilson Moore, who in turn loves her. Into this soap opera wanders the title character, Bent Wade. Wade once led a wild life but now has reformed his ways. He harbors a secret: he is Columbine's actual father. It's something he can't reveal, but it motivates him to try and give her a happy ending.Despite being nearly a century old, this novel reads easily and is overall, pretty good. It may not be great literature, but Grey's intent is to entertain, and he does this well. The Western may not be a major genre anymore, but The Mysterious Rider shows why it was successful in the past."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider is an amazing book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I especially like being able to get free books and reading them on my Kindle app."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider perhaps would have been better titled, Beauty and the Beast, and I am not in any way being disparaging. Zane Grey used the same type of plot lines for many of his books, and then added an extra character to bring the book to its logical conclusion. A young girl, the adopted daughter of a wealthy rancher, is forced to marry the rancher's no-good, drunk of a son, while the young girl loves another cowboy as different from the son as could possibly be--a similar scenario is found in Heritage of the Desert. But here a \\"mysterious stranger\\" is on the scene to make things right. And we can all guess who this \\"mysterious stranger\\" is, can't we? If you can't guess, I'm not going to tell you and ruin the book. Still, having said that, this book is a good Zane Grey romance told as only the master of historical romance could tell it, and worth reading--even more than once."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The name of this book, while intriguing, is somehwat misleading. I expected to read a tale about an enigmatic gunfighter, but instead, was subjected to nothing more than a romance set on a ranch in the old west.

This magnificent novel explores memory and its loss in contexts spanning the extremely personal, interpersonal, familial, metropolitan, architectural, mythic, philosophic, and religious. In a feat unsurpassed in virtuosity, Douglas Anthony Cooper has written a compelling, page-turning fictional memoir/mystery in a truly poetic voice."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"A man with no memory. A memory with no man. And the broken girl who spans the bridge between them.There are books that are read and enjoyed, books that thrill, that scare, that anger, that birth hope, renew faith, hint at love.Amnesiais not one of those books. In fact,Amnesiaisn't quite like any other book I've read, and now that I've done so, ordering my thoughts and feelings about it seem as herculean a task as understanding all the brilliant nuances and twisting labyrinths found in its pages. But I'll try.Highly stylized, brutally intelligent, psychotically affecting, this dark tale of a young man's twisted life and identity is gripping and morose, sickly seeping a sense of impending doom as it progresses in fits and starts, sliding forwards and backwards. It's a story boldly told, uniquely told, in a rambling narrative with a shifting focus, a narrative that slaps the reader upside the head with blurry snapshots of crystalline images. Broken family, tragedy, isolation, angst, sexual assault, theft, suicide of the mind, identity, Cooper hits hard with a panorama of confused misery and keeps it coming in this tale that - with its abstract and esoteric fugues - is both hard to follow and impossible to set down.If I am to be honest, and though it pains me to admit, I can't say I understood all of it. In fact, parts of it left my mind feeling beaten, as if my intellect went to war and came home in a black bag. I can't even say I liked it, really. It's not the sort of book that I consider likable. It's depressing, confusing, and roughly akin to what my imagination would attribute to a bad acid trip. It's also compelling, and irresistible, and more than a little heartbreaking. Whether I liked it or not seems far too pedestrian a question for the weight of my emotional response to it.If I understood it just a wee bit more, if it were just a small bit less...out there, more concrete, a bit more comprehensible in those sections that, for me, weren't, this would be one of the most significant books I've ever read. I still wouldn't say I liked it, but it sure as hell would've garnered five stars. Perhaps when I reread it...and I will definitely, unequivocally reread it...I'll be able to put together some of those pieces that didn't quite fit for me. I definitely think attacking it with the big picture intact would open up new layers of the telling for appreciation.There were sections towards the middle and again towards the end that seemed - I'm sorry to say - to balloon out a bit. That seemed to take the dangerous step from abstruse to pedantic, not for the sake of the story being told, but just to be even more enigmatic. Those few passages kept me from waving my hands in the air and stomping my feet in full appreciation. Those few passages were the only ones in this tight, confusing, and deeply sorrowful masterpiece where my attention wavered and my mind shied away.The rest...well, it's not Milrose Munce, certainly, but it's another side of the mind of an author who, I'm beginning to suspect, thinks so far outside the lines he's in a different parking lot. On a different planet. Visiting, however, always leaves a lasting...memory.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for the purpose of an honest review.

Worth more than one read for its complexity. This is not simply a book - it is decidedly an experience. Dark and depressing, but altogether entirely interesting."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Amnesia is aptly named. Reading it, you feel like you yourself have forgotten something integral. It moves at a deadly, feverish pace, twisting itself out of recognition, becoming something more than a novel. Just as Torontois an organic city within the book, the book itself is organic. It grows into and out of itself. It finds its way into your life."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"So good you may have to read it twice.

Go ahead and purchase, at the price you have very little to lose"},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Douglas Anthony Cooper escaped me until last week and for the life of me, I don't know why I downloaded Amnesia for my Kindle. Regardless, this author has impressed me greatly with his way with words, way with creating characters, way with interweaving and juxtaposing tales, and he has given me a novel which I am eager to reread. Because I was able to highlight passages on the Kindle, I am can access incredible statements at my convenience. This is not a novel which is read and forgotten, but rather one which festers and reappears at any time, like memories that are triggered without warning. It is literature which I believe is timeless and I recommend this novel to those who enjoy being immersed in a story without thinking about the weakness of an author's words."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Although I have owned the book since it was published lo these many years ago, I decided to download the Kindle version for my wife to read, and was of course compelled to read it again myself for a third time. This novel continues to astonish me. With every re-reading, it seems to have shape-shifted silkie-like into a new conformation with fresh and compelling insights into the human psyche: coming of age, shattering loss, family dynamics, unintended consequences, and so much more. It's beyond me to attempt to say just 'what it's about', but I love the beauty of language and the sharpness of observation, the harsh yet tender disemboweling of the main characters' inner conflicts, and the lovely way that a spectral hidden city is conjured to interpenetrate the familiar city of Toronto. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"I'm extremely pleased to see that \\"Amnesia\\" is finally available in ebook format; its print run was far too brief for a debut novel that's so profoundly intricate and compelling. Reviewing \\"Amnesia\\" is extremely difficult, because every plot device in the book, no matter how small, points to how and why Izzy Darlow, the main character, connects with the hapless Katie after she's institutionalized. Reading this book is a lot like trying to open a puzzle box in the sense that it has an almost addictive quality. Cooper's style is stunningly gorgeous -- I can definitely see why he's been compared to Calvino -- and has a distinctly cinematic quality. Splendid read!"},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Really thrilled to see this book re-published on Kindle! Douglas Anthony Cooper shows amazing insight into his characters' tortured psyches. Also, he gives an intimate glimpse into the variegated world that is Toronto."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"The person who wrote \\"Glad I could get a refund\\" is a troll connected to the animal rights groups that Mr. Cooper has been exposing in the Huffington Post, PETA and the HSUS. This person also left reviews on Mr. Cooper's young adult novels, telling people not to buy them because they're pornographic - which of course they aren't. Read them for yourself. Seriously."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"...I'd imagine his novel would read like Amnesia. This is not a light read. It is not the sort of book you would take to the beach on a sunny August afternoon, but the sort you read at 3:00am under the covers. Amnesia may be an intelligent and highly quotable book, but it is also confusing. I will say that everything one really needs to know is within its pages, but the question lies in whether the reader knows for what he or she is looking. Diligent or not, every reader will undeniably learn something from this novel. It is unique, compelling, and most likely unlike anything you've read until now."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Okay first off - I will disagree with those who say that if you read Milrose you must read this as I sent Milrose to my young nephew and even though he sometimes reads \\"adult\\" books instead of books meant for a younger audience, this would be beyond him. So while yes this is the same author who wrote Milrose please make no mistake - it's not for everyone who read and loved that book.Now with that said, for the rest of us, I'm not even sure where to begin. The book itself sort of warns of that straight off, we'll forget. The book is about Izzy. Or a man with no memories struggling to figure out who he is before he gets married. Or a dysfunctional family. Or young girls who ended up going through way more than just typical heartbreak of youth. Or... well I forget.While most try to compare books, even loosely, to others to give you an idea of what you'll get from lesser known books I'm not sure I can compare this book to another or explain it fairly. The best I can say is that I felt as though I were reading a coming of age flashback story (albeit with more serious issues than the usual rah rah stereotypical who will I take to the prom stuff) if told by Tyler Durden of Fight Club (okay I worked in another novel reference after all). You won't want to pick this one to just read a little here and there and get back to it later - as I said, you'll forget, or get lost, etc. It will mess with you even as you're reading it straight through, and that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Prepare to use your noodle as you enter the many rooms of Mr. Cooper! A deeply philosophical and intense study of nuerotic/erotic/psychotic animal man.

If you have ever questioned the correlation between family and fate, I urge you to find this book!"},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"Like a rotted tooth or a troubling sore I return to this book. Scrape aside the scab of human suffering and Cooper finds the sore beneath. Enigmatic and esoteric, he delivers the knock out punch when least expected. As a long time fan of Eco and Borges, I appreciated Cooper's craft and touch upon his work when I get a chance. This is not an exit."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"For those who thrive on the dreamy landscape of the surreal, \\"Amnesia\\", by Douglas Anthony Cooper, a Toronto ex-pat now in Oaxaca, is an absolute must. Cooper's nameless narrator ensnares the reader in an erotic psychological terroir. Cooper is a multi-talented author with a wide range. After you finish \\"Amnesia\\",treat yourself to \\"Milrose Munce and the Plague of the Toxic Fungus\\" and \\"Milrose Munce and the Den of Professional Help\\", Cooper's Young Adult series, and pour yourself a big shot of mezcal and settle in."},{"Title":"Amnesia","review":"I read the print version years ago, and it had a major affect on me, and also on my friends- I passed it around.

You have no idea what is going on any of the time or who is talking or in what time period it's occurring. If I could give it negative stars - I would. I cannot stress enough the stupidity of this book. Do NOT waste your time. I think the other reviewers have all lost their minds.I do, however, enjoy this author's other books. I've read his Milrose Munce books and found them quite odd but good. I don't mind having to think while I read and I was able to follow what was going on in Amnesia but I prefer a more solid structure and less allusion.

In fact, I liked it better than Fire in the Ashes and put it just below Out of the Ashes. In the book, Ben Raines is no longer President of the US, and is attempting to rebuild the concept of the Tri-State by attempting to rebuild down near Alabama/Louisianna (or what remains) while he is faced with a much tougher enemy than he had faced with the Federal soldiers within Out of the Ashes and Fire in the Ashes. The Russians have settled in Iceland working on a master race and have decided to move through Canada to the United States. Instead of bringing war with them, they preach peace, unity among the white \\"pure race\\" and extermination of other races they refer to as \\"inferior\\". Additionally, they are working to establish a mutant/human cross capable of being a labor race. The book was a bit graphic throughout the plot; however, considering the state of the nation at that time, it would be expected. Maybe not at such a grand scale, but expected. The book contains an excellent example of unity among civilians as well as Raines's Rebels to work together to fight. At first, the Russians appeared very tough however I was suprised how \\"quickly\\" the story changed and suddenly these well-armed and well-trained blond haired, blue eyed soldiers rolled over to what remained of Raines's Rebels, old men, and children. In the end, Raines is viewed as a god and seems to allude to him accepting a role as a spiritual leader in his book(s) to follow. It's next on my list, so I'll read and report."},{"Title":"Anarchy In The Ashes","review":"Anarchy is the perfect next step in the Ashes series. As we learn of a threat from a former Soviet General, Ben Raines is attempting to muster his people and start anew. The dialogue and suspense of this novel clearly shows that William Johnstone has a hit of a series on his hands. We see in this installment how Ben just wants him and his people to be left alone to carve out a society that is as best for all as possible. But, with the horror that the IPF is bringing, along with the diabolical Sam Hartline, Ben and his people know that they are the nation's only hope. Sam Hartline is the quintessential villan, and every page makes you despise him more than you would think possible."},{"Title":"Anarchy In The Ashes","review":"I love this book - love the idea, love the characters, love the plot BUT - the author, for some reason only known to him, has filled this book (and his others) with an adolescent-like sadism details that have absolutely no place in this book (or others, unless theyre sold at adult book stores!). This is a book about teotwawki and how the survivors try to save civilization from evil and although a little bit of sexual torture description would lend itself to the plot, the constant barrage of juvenile sex terms and, again, adolescent-like sex torture fantasies are just plain distracting and I find myself skipping over them and rolling my eyes and asking why Mr. Johnstone?

I had been using the Time Out guide in the city, which is infinitely better, but I brought this guide on a trip to Colonia and Montevideo because it had much more information. As it turned out, nothing the guide recommended for Montevideo was true or even open. It listed two vegetarian restaurants, one with three locations throughout the city. I spent the better part of a day walking around the city only to find that not a single one of those four was still in existence. I then found a Lebanese restaurant in the guide and walked there, only to find that it wasn't open either.

It contains only basic information about Buenos Aires and leaves out plenty of interesting facts. For example, the Feria de Mataderos is not even mentioned once in the book and that is definitely worth seeing. The book contains a lot of photos, but I could care less about that. It seems like the boring postcard photos were simply stuck in the book to take up space and provide a superficial, worthless gloss (perhaps to up the price).I expected much better quality from Lonely Planet. I bought this book because it was a Lonely Planet guide and I had been happy with these guides in the past. However, after this book, I have negatively changed my opinion of Lonely Planet. I will NEVER again buy another Lonely Planet book without looking at it first in-person.This book is a total disappointment.

Also you can change Brasilian Reales, Euros, and Pounds. Example A Water Bottle is worth about 1.20 Pesos, a gooood and juicy Steak is worth 16 pesos. A Taxi is worth about 6 or 10 pesos.

What makes this one so special?For me, it's quite literally the next best thing to watching a video; 417 pages of *step-by-step* illustration, instruction, strategy, team offense/defense and advice. It's logically ordered, offering a basis for beginning, intermediate and advanced levels of play, so any player can pick it up and quickly understand what's required of them should they decide to play an \\"intermediate\\" pickup game for example.I like how this book is intended to help you grow as you learn and advance. It's unlike all the others I've owned that like to \\"talk\\" about strategy or how to pass, then leaves the reader to figure out what they're on about. I was never once lost or confused and felt as if the author was there coaching me one on one. As I improved on one skill or play, the next step was ready for me to pick up.One thing this book could NOT help me with was SPEED of movement. I play four times a week, and as you play with more advanced players, you'll be shocked as to how quickly some of these guys and gals can get to the ball (seemingly from the other side of the court) and STILL pass with remarkable precision. You'll notice improvements in your own speed over time, but to get better more quickly, you'll have to find other sources for exercises (or just play more often). TIP: they tell me that playing doubles -especially on sand- will help improve your speed and accuracy. I'm aiming to do this next summer.The book itself is quite heavy, but the level of detail makes it worth its weight in volleyball gold. It may be a bit dated in terms of the latest rules and regulations, but the fundamentals haven't changed and the info is solid.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"A series of short stories, tales told in a bar (the White Hart) among a group of scientists, writers, and laymen. The central story-teller is one Henry Purvis, an obnoxious fellow with a trick of pausing at the climax for a new draught beer, whom no one has yet managed to prove a liar. He tells almost believable tales of science and wouldn't-it-be-nice science. One learns of a silencer that silences more than guns, a carnivorous orchid with a secret, a ballistic computer with a sense of humour. Much of the delight in the tales arises from the fact that they were written in the 1950's, and it is amazing how much Clarke could see of the future. I suspect Clarke may have felt he'd written himself into a corner, because the series of tales and the book end rather suddenly, with a hint for the future but no real hope that Purvis will be back. A delghtful find, to be read by all who enjoy Clarke, bar stories, science fiction, and humour."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"If you can think of one set of SF short stories involving tall tales told in bars, it's probably Spider Robinson's 'Callahan's' series. But if you can think of two, this is probably the second.Although never as big a Clarke fan as I've been of Asimov and Heinlein, I still have fond memories of several of Clarke's books. _Rendezvous with Rama_ is probably his best novel and it's been one of my favorites of his since it was first published. His short stories, too, are generally of high quality (remember e.g. 'The Nine Billion Names of God'?).The series of tales collected herein is a bit different (for Clarke). For one thing, they're _funny_ -- Arthur C. Clarke funny, that is, not Douglas Adams funny, but funny all the same.They're on the light side and they're deftly executed. But don't expect guffaws; in order to appreciate Harry Purvis and his stories, you pretty much have to be the sort of person who thinks 'The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch' is a funny title.If you've read Clarke but you haven't read this book, grab a copy and see what you think.

This is one of the most entertaining collections of stories in the sci-fi genre. At the White Hart, a British pub, are an odd assortment of patrons from the literary and scientific fields, as well as laymen interested in the discussions going on around them. One Harry Purvis inevitably manages to dominate the talk with his incredible tales of wondrous scientific romance, which he insists are true. He will often find a good reason for leaving just as a flaw in his story starts to become obvious to one or more of his listeners, and they wax suspicious that the tale truly is incredible. The way Clarke weaves real science with interesting and hilarious short fiction makes this one of my favorites of all his works. I would especially recommend it to readers who are new to science-fiction. Unlike a lot of such works, this one only gets better with age."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"Welcome to the White Hart, where every Wednesday night features a gathering of scientists, writers, and interested on-lookers who come to drink tepid beer and be regaled by the Tall Tales of one Harry Purvis, a man of uncertain origins, profession, and education, who claims to know so much about so many subjects of scientific interest. These tales were originally published individually, but together they are 'bookended' by &quot;Silence Please&quot; and &quot;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch&quot; to create a kind of frame story. Purvis' deadpan declamations of yarns that range from all-too-believable to patently absurd, combined with the fictional Clarke's own pointed comments about the White Hart, its clientele, and Purvis' overall credibility, make this perhaps the funniest science fiction book ever written. Using analogy in place of logic, Purvis posits wildly improbable advances in a number of different directions that in some cases have paralleled actual scientific developments that have taken place in the decades since these stories were written.More serious-minded fans should take pleasure in the not-always-easy task of finding the precise flaws in Purvis' stories, which usually include just enough hard science to be credible to the casual layman. &quot;The Next Tenants&quot; is the only story in this collection that has any really serious message to it, and while the story is chillingly effective despite its absurdities, this book is really about laughs. From that standpoint, &quot;Moving Spirit&quot; is probably the best, featuring an eccentric millionaire, his illegal distillery, and a hilarious courtroom scene in which Purvis testifies as an expert witness with devastating results.Despite the occasional slapstick moments, Clarke's humor is generally on the dry side, so this book may not please everyone. There isn't a lot of action in the traditional action/adventure sense, and female characters are usually absent or antagonistic. Still, if you're comfortable in a males-only, scientific atmosphere, there's plenty of good clean fun to be had at the White Hart."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"Belly up to the bar lads and take a listen to the tales to be told at the White Hart Pub.

Clarke* In square brackets: the year of first publication, usually in a magazine.=======================================This is Arthur Clarke's third short story collection - and certainly the most unusual one he ever published. It is important to establish immediately that this is the only case where Clarke deliberately wrote fantasy, or scientific \\"tall tales\\" as he charmingly calls them. Naturally, too, the prime purpose of such tales is pure and uninhibited entertainment.The ''White Hart\\" must be one of the most famous pubs in fiction, a most amazing place where scientists, publishers and science fiction writers (what a combination!) get together every Wednesday evening. Then, in between chess games and cryptic publishing deals, enormous amounts of beer change barrels and fantastic (literally, remember) stories are told - at least until the barman Drew announces that it's time to close and kicks everybody out in the \\"cold hard world\\" . By far the most remarkable raconteur in the ''White Hart\\" is one Harry Purvis, by way of being scientist himself, with endless list of acquaintances and relatives, one crazier than the other, and having the most annoying habit of pausing to \\"refuel\\" his glass exactly when the climax of a story is swiftly approaching. Nobody really believes him, but everybody enjoys his meticulously crafted, and even better researched, tales (surely no one can have the cheek to make that up?) and everybody is genuinely sorry when one day he suddenly disappears from the pub.It might be worth noting that among the regular clients of the \\"White Hart\\" are subjects like John Wyndam and Charlie Willies, the former is in need of no introduction but the latter is \\"the most promising author I know (he has been promising for more than twenty-five years)\\". Quite the most charming self-pun I have ever seen that, for \\"Charlie Willis\\" is the pseudonym under which Clarke published some of his early short stories. It is probably significant that Charlie is also \\"one of Harry's most implacable critics\\". Well, in fact, Harry is such a colourful character himself, that all other die-hard White-Hart aficionados make only very occasional appearances. He is such a masterful story-teller, however, that the only tale (\\"Big Game Hunt\\") which is not told by him, or is not based on his bizarre adventures, is by far the weakest in the book. Together with the mysterious pub, Mr Purvis is introduced in the first story and bids his farewell, figuratively speaking, in the last one, but otherwise the pieces are completely independent from another, few mild cross-references notwithstanding. Now let's try to have a more serious look - a very difficult thing when discussing such decidedly and deliberately flippant fiction - at the strengths and weaknesses of this marvellous collection.As a matter of fact, most of these stories are surprisingly serious. The fact that they are pretty improbable does not prevent Clarke from putting most of them on very firm scientific foundations. Just by the way, as a special bonus, you can learn a lot about interference (\\"Silence, Please\\"), the mysterious and so elusive force called antigravity (\\"What Goes Up\\") or the stupendous source of metals and minerals that sea water may prove to be in the future (\\"The Man Who Ploughed the Sea\\"). Most of these matters Clarke has discussed thoroughly in his non-fiction writings (see Profiles of the Future, for instance) but his adroitness to turn them into highly amusing fiction in which there is nothing dry or academic is something to marvel at. Indeed, sometimes it is quite a challenge to find out where is the end of the scientific fact and the beginning of the science fiction. So my labelling all of these pieces as fantasy in the beginning is a trifle wide of the mark.Even more fascinating is the fact that many stories, though definitely tongue-in-cheek in tone, actually have quite a few serious overtones. For instance, \\"Armaments Race\\" is a thinly veiled satire of the ridiculous space operas (isn't that a little prescient for the mid-1950s?) and \\"Patent Pending\\" has some shrewd remarks that may not be enjoyed by publishers and reviewers. And sometimes these tales can be very serious indeed. \\"The Ultimate Melody\\" is positively heart-rending and it does give me a pause to reflect upon the utterly mysterious - perhaps scientifically unknowable - phenomenon of the influence of music upon many people. The story also has a haunting opening:Have you ever noticed that, when there are twenty or thirty people talking together in a room, there are occasional moments when everybody becomes suddenly silent, so that for a second there's a sudden, vibrating emptiness that seem to swallow up all sound? I don't know how it affects other people, but when it happens it makes me feel cold all over. Of course, the whole thing's merely caused by the laws of probability, but somehow it seems more than mere coinciding of conversational pauses. It's almost as if everybody is listening to something - they don't know what.Of the stories with a strong streak of seriousness, my personal favourite is \\"The Next Tenants\\". In this extraordinary tale some wild extrapolations about a human-guided evolution of termites make a rather chilling read. Decades later, using ants instead, Bernard Werber would write some of the most shattering works I have ever encountered. There is no better way to teach oneself some humility and to better appreciate the miracle of life in all of its multitudinous forms than asking the not-so-easy-as-it-seems question \\"Are we really masters of this world?\\" Going down in scale, but going up in numbers and collective intelligence, while reading \\"The Next Tenants\\" might give you some startlingly disturbing notions to consider. Similarly serious, though in a very different field, is \\"The Man Who Ploughed the Sea\\". Here the monstrous question that looms large is \\"What kind of job are we doing as masters of this world?\\" Just imagine, for the sake of the argument, what would happen if the technology for \\"mining the sea\\" described in the story really did become reality in the future. Overfishing and using the sea as a garbage container would seem trivial in comparison.But dwelling too much on the serious sides of these stories is definitely missing the point. Most of these tales are unabashed fun, deliberately and deliciously ridiculous. Perhaps my personal winner here is \\"Moving Spirit\\", a perfectly wacky tale about one of Harry's more eccentric relatives who tried to make whiskey illegally but discovered something quite different. \\"Cold War\\" is a hilarious story about some very unexpected side effects of the rivalry between California and Florida which is the sunniest state in the States. I don't think anybody could read \\"The Reluctant Orchid\\", a parody of horror and crime fiction if there ever was one, keeping straight face,either. The bizarrely titled \\"The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch\\" and the ludicrous \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" are other memorable examples, the former having a poignant reference to Harry himself which feminists would surely love - indeed, the latter would probably appeal to this aberration of the female psyche even more. We will do Arthur Clarke a great injustice if we neglect to mention that, in such light stories, the insight into his characters is as sharp as ever. If you think I am making this up, here are some examples taken from here and there:[Here is another candy for the feminists; from \\"Sleeping Beauty\\".]''Henrietta, rightly despising men as the weaker sex, had never married. However, for some reason she took an avuncular (yes, that is definitely the right word) interest in Hercules, and called to see him almost every weekend. It was a curious kind of relationship: probably Henrietta found that Hercules bolstered up her feelings of superiority. If he was a good example of the male sex, then they were certainly a pretty sorry lot. Yet, if this was Henrietta's motivation, she was unconscious of it and seemed genuinely fond of her nephew. She was patronizing, but never unkind.''[Very perceptive observation about the unequal distribution of wealth and its effects on human beings.]''It is rather amusing, Harry told us, to notice the subtle social distinctions which differences of wealth can produce even in the most democratic country. By Harry's standards, George was a very rich man [...] But Dr Romano was in another price range altogether, and had to be treated accordingly with a kind of friendly respect which had nothing to do with obsequiousness. On his side, the Doctor was perfectly free and easy; there was nothing about him that gave any impression of wealth, if one ignored such trivia as hundred-and-fifty-foot ocean-going yachts.''[Last but not least, Clarke's penetrating gaze can sum up surroundings as well, particularly the \\"White Hart\\" itself.]''A great deal of business also goes on in the obscurer corners of the pub. Copies of antique books and magazines frequently change hands at astronomical prices, and on almost any Wednesday at least three well-known dealers may be seen smoking large cigars as they lean over the bar, swapping stories with Drew. From time to time, a vast guffaw announces the denouement of some anecdote and provokes a flood of anxious enquiries from patrons who are afraid they may have missed something. But, alas, delicacy forbids that I should repeat any of these interesting tales here. Unlike most things in this island, they are not for export....''So why only four stars? As a light and fantastic entertainment - all this collection was intended to be - Tales from the White Hart delivers the goods splendidly; besides, there are more than enough poignancy and pathos just below the surface. It is true that the collection does lack any of Clarke's trademark themes (space exploration, the first contact, etc.), but the great number and variety of mad scientists (some out to conquer the world, others not) more than compensates for this. The fact of catching Clarke in so unusual a field for him is refreshing in itself.The main drawback of the collection is the usual one for Clarke: rather uneven quality. \\"Big Game Hunt\\", which might have been spared publication, was mentioned, and here I may add \\"Armaments Race\\", \\"Patent Pending\\" and \\"The Pacifist\\" to those stories which do entertain, but certainly lack the wry humour and perfect completeness so typical for Clarke. Many of the endings are open, which in itself is a fine method, but most of these, including the three stories just mentioned, are rather anti-climactic and thus unsatisfactory. And there is at least one case (\\"Critical Mass\\") where a fine twist in the end cannot compensate for rather dull story otherwise. All these tales fall rather short of the standards set by the other pieces in the same collection.There is one other thing, too, that detracts from Tales from the White Hart as a whole. This is a certain kind of monotony. With one unfortunate and already mentioned exception, all stories are either told by Harry Purvis himself or based on his experiences but paraphrased by the narrator (called \\"Arthur\\" by Harry in \\"What Goes Up\\") who is even more amusing than his colleague. Yet the usual variety of narrative techniques, characters and locales so characteristic for Clarke's collections is missing here; indeed, the ''mad scientist'' concept is a little too often encountered. But the exchange between \\"Harry\\" and \\"Arthur\\" is worth quoting:''Harry turned to me and said: 'There's an analogy I'd like to borrow from one of your books, Arthur, that puts across the point I'm trying to make. You know - comparing the fight against Earth's gravity to climbing out of a deep pit.''You're welcome,' I said. 'I pinched it from Doc Richardson, anyway.''Oh,' replied Harry. 'I thought it was too good to be original.'''The book in question is Clarke's first published one, the technical yet absorbing Interplanetary Flight (1950), and the analogy does occur there, even though \\"Doc Richardson\\" remains elusive. Was he given indirect credit in fiction? Perhaps. One of the many charming nuances of the collection are the numerous references to real people, works of art or historical events - from Wells to Wilde and from Sibelius' Second Symphony to the battle of Gettysburg - which both demonstrate Clarke's impressive erudition and stimulate in the reader the game \\"find out the facts behind the fiction\\", or the better one \\"learn more history about your favourite fiction\\". As any great writer, pretty much everything Clarke wrote was firmly based on reality. So, indeed, was the \\"White Hart\\" as acknowledged in the preface. Who was the prototype of Harry Purvis, and how much of him was fact and how much fiction, is anybody's guess.At any rate, Tales from the White Hart is a most entertaining collection of short stories, adroitly mixing the serious and the scientific with the flippant and the ludicrous. Uneven and monotonous as it may be, it demonstrates Clarke's considerable powers to have fun, even though in his other collections there are many more memorable examples such as \\"Trouble with the Natives\\", \\"Loophole\\" and \\"No Morning After\\".The book is essential reading for Clarke aficionados, of course, but due to its limited scope, it is not a really good introduction for Clarke neophytes."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"In a similar setup to the Gavagan's Bar stories, but, as Clarke says, set in the UK, not the USA.His bar actually features John Christopher, John Wyndham and 'George Whitley' in small cameos in the tall tales recounted by Harry Purvis. So a haunt of the literary types someone under a newspaper building or thereabouts, is what he says, so maybe pointing out a real pub somewhere he liked?Anyway, all from around the 1950 mark, these. All they are intended to be is fun stories, and the author pretty much succeeds at that, in general.Tales from the White Hart : Silence Please! - Arthur C.

Although it's been almost 30 years since I read this book, I can still vividly recall most of the stories, and the pleasure I had first reading them. The story revolves around a British scientist who frequents a local tavern and who can spin some of the most outlandish yarns of wayward science and technology over a pint that anyone has ever heard. But he's obviously so well-informed and convincing about the science and the details of the stories that nobody quite knows whether the stories are apocryphal or not. But the fun is in the believing. This book is one of the most light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek classics in the annals of science-fiction, and Clarke's deft touch with these funny tales is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"Readers of some of my other reviews know that I am partial to science fictional tavern or club stories. There are basically two ways of relating fantastic events in such settings. The first is to have the events occur in the tavern itself (as in the Gavagan's Bar stories or the Callahan's Crosstime Saloon tales). The second method is to have a \\"tall tale\\" spun out by a plausible narrator (as in the Jorkens stories or the Brigadier Ffelllows tales).Arthur C. Clarke's _Tales From the White Hart_ (1957) belongs to the second tradition-- the science fictional tall tale. Clarke writes of the White Hart: \\"not only have some remarkable stories been told there, but remarkable things have _happened_ there\\" (2). But this is just window dressing. The happenings are alluded to rather than sharply dramatized. The pub is primarily a place where stories are told.There are fifteen outrageous stories in all, most of them narrated by the nimble-witted Harry Purvis. I like the Harry Purvis stories better than Sterling Lanier's Donald Ffellows stories, because Clarke makes Purvis less respectable or trustworthy than the Brigadier. You can't _quite_ catch Purvis or trip him up-- he slips out the door just before somebody spots a flaw in his story-- but you don't _quite_ trust him, either. He is more interesting to watch in action than Ffellows.Purvis, a \\"small, neatly dressed man in the late thirties\\" who is \\"smoking one of those carved German pipes that almost always make me think of cuckoo clocks and the Black Forest\\" (3) bows quietly in with \\"Silence Please\\" and comes to an ignonomous end in \\"The Defenestration of Erminitrude Inch\\".\\"Big Game Hunt\\" is the one story not told by Harry Purvis-- the _raconteur_ is a fast-talking American scientist who steals Purvis's thunder. \\"What Goes Up\\" is the one story that Purvis never meant to be taken seriously (and the one story that was).Some of the stories feature Harry Purvis himself. \\"Critical Mass\\" recounts how Harry saved the English countryside from evacuation (but not for the reason you might think). \\"The Next Tenants\\" is an account of Harry's encounter with a mad scientist who is inclined to let mankind go down the tubes. \\"Moving Spirit\\" concerns Harry's role as a witness in an explosive legal trial: \\"The Court went into recess with a speed never matched in the annals of British law\\" (83).But most of the stories are about other people. My favorites are the one about the computer that makes monkeys of the Army brass (\\"The Pacifist\\"); the account of oranges, icebergs, and Russian submarines (\\"Cold War\\"); the sad tale of the zap guns for the Captain Zoom television show (\\"Armaments Race\\"); and the tale of Hercules, Aunt Henrietta, and the carnivorous flower (\\"The Reluctant Orchid\\").Perhaps some attention should be given to the White Hart itself. It is a \\"little microcosm\\" (2) that is in, but not precisely a part of London. For the first dozen visits \\"a guide is essential\\" (1). Few newcomers who _try_ to find the pub will succeed. And this suits the patrons. They do not want to see flying saucer nuts or various other tiresome oddballs:Peculiar people with new theories of the universe, characters who have been \\"cleared\\" by Dianetics (God knows what they were like before), intense ladies who are likely to go all clairvoyant after the fourth gin-- these are the less exotic specimens. (120-121)Well, who are the regulars at the White Hart? There is Drew the Bartender. There are writers, editors, scientists, and intelligent laypeople. Arthur C. Clarke narrates the tales of Harry Purvis. But John Cristopher, John Beynon, William Temple, Charles Eric Maine, and other British science fiction writers keep popping up in guest roles. Clarke claims to be a bit afraid that one of these other writers will get the jump on him in recounting the Purvis tales. The decor of the pub is old fashioned. There is no television. There is a jukebox that has long since been disconnected. I wish to God more bars were like that today.The White Hart stories are funny. I have read them over a dozen times, and I still laugh at them. But you should understand. The humor is not a slapstick American humor. It is a dry British humor. Alec Guiness rather than Jerry Lewis."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"Absolutely Hilarious. A must have. I shouted for Joy when I saw it was in print again."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"I have read this book several times, and on the most recent I finally figured out that the narrarator was Arthur C. Clarke. My favorite story was &quot;The Reluctant Orchid&quot;, because Hercules eventually snapped and tried to kill his aunt, but it was too much for the poor plant. As an amateur botanist I find the story inprobable, but funny."},{"Title":"Tales from the White Hart","review":"I'd been searching for this item across the world and finally found one on Amazon.com.

I'm a new comer to science fiction, but if all the sci-fi writers can do what A.C. Clark does in this book, I am really looking forward to reading them. Each short story in the book relate to one another. They basically build up to a climax and then you're left wondering, &quot;Is that it??? I want more!&quot;. Even though this book was written circa 1957, it is a &quot;way out&quot; read and very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Swinburne: The Poet in his World","review":"Thomas's &quot;Swinburne&quot; is an acceptable biography, conveying the necessary names, dates and places of ACS's life. The volume, however, is curiously thin, given the monster tomes generated in recent years on Morris, Ruskin and other members of the mid-Victorian set. In covering his territory, one gets the impression that Thomas didn't quite know what to do with the prurient bits of Swinburne's life, alternately dwelling on them and skipping past them. Nonetheless, students of mid-Victorian culture should be grateful for a thoughtful book on so shamefully neglected a poet."},{"Title":"Swinburne: The Poet in his World","review":"I've always fairly despised Swinburne's poetry. The overdose on alliteration and overripe settings never did much for me, and he has always been my least favorite of the major 19th-century poets. I knew he was also a well-regarded critic, and someone who'd led an anecdote-rich life, so when I recently I read a biography of the Rossetti siblings and S's name kept coming up in some of the more charming incidents, I thought I'd dive in.This book is indeed rich in anecdotes. Swinburne, the son of an Admiral and of noble blood, emerges as such a singular figure, who associated with just about every Victorian of note. He led a fascinating life, carrying a wit with him that Wilde--who A. C. once dismissed as a \\"a harmless young nobody\\"--would have felt dampened his own parade a bit. He was an eternal child, a classicist, a revolutionary (Mazzini his padre d'oro, Napoleon III his bte noire) who later turned conservative.The quotes and references to Swinburne's prose travesties on Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, including an incident when the fevered queen cannot resist the \\"smouldering sensuality\\" of Wordsworth's \\"The Excursion\\" and so gives in to her passion for the old Laureate, are worth the price of the book alone.This is more a straight biography than a literary one. The author discusses--and \\"defends\\"--his subject's erotic and political proclivities in detail, but not much of S's verse is quoted, and still less of his criticism and prose. I still don't like his poetry, and I am curious to read more of his prose and criticism--Swinburne had an inventive mind. But for a life of Swinburne focusing on his eccentricities, friendships, a cavalcade of humorous anecdotes, and the definite pains and agonies he suffered to alcohol and not quite being able to find his purpose in life, this book serves its purpose well. I came away with a new-found admiration for A. C. Swinburne."},{"Title":"Swinburne: The Poet in his World","review":"Lots of information here, and the author doesn't shy away from the more controversial aspects of the poet's life. Two criticisms, however: First, the author jumps around, A LOT, making it sometimes hard to keep up chronologically with what is going on, and when. Second, I couldn't help but wonder if Thomas actually likes A.C. Swinburne. The timbre of the book tends to lean somewhat towards condescension at times, perhaps even derision."},{"Title":"Swinburne: The Poet in his World","review":"John Swinburne, the poet's grandfather, was his idol. He had been a friend and sympathizer of Mirabeau and John Wilkes. Algernon Charles Swinburne was born in 1837. His father was an admiral, a family man. Admiral Swinburne subsidized his son's literary career.At Eton the poet had shaped his obsessions and enthusiasms. The Victorian public school system was characteristically brutal, vicious. Swinburne was an oddity and a recluse. By age thirteen, reading on his own, he knew the plays of Marlowe, Webster, Ford, Massinger. In 1856 he entered Balliol College. Mid-Victorian Oxford had romantic charm. The Pre-Raphaelites discovered Oxford.Benjamin Jowett claimed that Swinburne's essays were all language and no thought. Jowett taught the poet habits of work, (salvation by work). The fatal flaw of Swinburne's genius was that he lacked impetus, inspiration, notwithstanding his learning and facility.Swinburne's POEMS AND BALLADS was brought out in 1866. He saw Byron's career as a mirror of his own. ATALANTA IN CALYDON was issued in 1865. It was dedicated to William Savage Landor.As early as 1863 Swinburne suffered from fits. Swinburne was a figure head of an artistic movement, Art for Art's Sake. He received warnings about his conduct and the content of his writings from Browning and Ruskin. Jowett turned his Master's lodging into an intellectual salon. In the early 1870's he acted as Swinburne's external conscience. Swinburne's style of living exceeded his parents' ability to pay for it.By 1879 Algernon's health was at its worst. Lady Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton exchanged telegrams. Watts-Dunton was to act as domestic and moral nursemaid to Swinburne at The Pines located in Putney for the last thirty years of the poet's life.This is a moderately-sized book recounting the life and times of Algernon Swinburne briskly and adequately."},{"Title":"Swinburne: The Poet in his World","review":"I have recently come to study Swinburne's work in detail and found Thomas's biography helpful and interesting. It is a great book for those of us just coming to understand and appreciate the work of Algernon Charles Swinburne. The book reads easily, quickly and gives one a glimpse into Swinburne's world. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to begin studies on Swinburne and/or the Victorian World of writers and beyond."},{"Title":"History of the Town of Coventry 1900-1975","review":"I am impressed with the amount of information packed into this book.

His writing in general is superb. This book is a well organized first course in analysis broken into digestible chunks and surprisingly thorough. It covers the basic topics and then introduces the reader to complex analysis and later to Lebesque integration."},{"Title":"Introduction to Mathematical Analysis","review":"Bear does an excellent job of introducing real and complex analysis, but fails to generalize to general metric spaces and ignores R^n, for n&#62;2.However, he presents the fields axioms for the reals in a clear fashion.

There are many books on Fibonacci, Elliott Wave and Gann techniques. To read and understand them is simple, but to use them in harmony is difficult. This book is very good at simplifying the techniques and making them very readable and user friendly. Though this is not the be all and end all for technical analysis. You must understand other techniques independently. This book is full of examples on using different techniques as well as using them together to generate more reliable buy and sell signals. The book is short on theory but full of good real chart patterns, which are missing in most books"},{"Title":"The Trading Advantage","review":"The writer knows his stuff and I'm sure has made a great living applying it to the markets. The problem is his communication skills from a teaching or \\"how to\\" point-of-view are pathetic. He would have been better off giving the material to a professional writer.

There were plot holes after plot holes. Things he's lead up to for 5 books were ignored and glossed over. It didn't even seem like the same author wrote it.Overall I loved the series and despised the conclusion. So the question is, do I still recommend it to others? I have no idea."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Maybe my tastes are changing. I've really liked almost every Orson Scott Card book since I first read Ender's Game many years ago. I searched out books that weren't as well known or as easily available and found even greater appreciation for his work (check out Folk of the Fringe, Lost Boys and Enchantment for great reading). I followed him through several different series, some of which were just okay (the Homecoming series) and some were great. One series, The Tales of Alvin Maker was just a step below Ender, in my opinion...until I read the latest entry, The Crystal City.The characters were there, some action was there, but so much of the book was overblown soul searching that it got to the point where I was skipping paragraphs at a time, just to get on with the story. His wife misleads him, she does it for his own good, she should be with someone else, he should have more respect for his brother-in-law, he does what he thinks is best, his wife does what she thinks is best, Dead Mary loves Alvin, Dead Mary loves Arthur, Dead Mary doesn't really love anyone, blah, blah, blah.Card has some points he wants to get across, and Hey! - He wrote the book-so it is his right! But, come on, naming his creation \\"The Tabernacle\\", is just a little obvious. And just to confuse things, this comes after another character had just named it \\"The Observatory\\". I went back to reread that section just to see if there was a reason for naming it twice, but if there was, Orson didn't really get it across.When I had read the 3rd and 4th installments of this series, I actually thought this was going to be better than the Ender series. This was a huge let down. As a reader that has bought well over 25 Orson Scott Card books, I felt like this was a rip-off."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I was glad to see a continuation to the Alvin Maker series because Heartfire left off with a cliffhanger. The rest of the story was begging to be told. So, when The Crystal City came out, I was overjoyed. However, it too left me hanging. To begin with, I was lost when the story picked up. There were characters involved that had not been introduced. Mr. Card seemed to assume that we would figure it out along the way. Also, many of the characters that were with Alvin at the end of Heartfire were not present in any form. Also in this book, the LDS culture and theology (which is present in all of Mr. Card's works) was overly dominant in The Crystal City. I do appluad Mr. Card for having the courage and faith to present his beliefs to the rest of the world in a form that is much like the parables of Christ. However, unlike The Folk of the Fringe, The Crystal City is not primarily about the Mormon church. Therefore, it was suprising to see the LDS theology overpowering the story of Alvin Maker. Again, this is not saying that Mr. Card should leave his religious beliefs out of his writing. It is the case, however, that when theology or any well known story is used to pattern a novel after, the novel becomes very predictable and in this case, becomes more like reading the story of the Mormon migration. In fact, I found myself checking the included maps, to see exactly where the tabernacle was being built because I was so sure that Mr. Card's purpose in this book was to present his readers with a glimpse of Mormonisim.All in all, the Alvin Maker series is one of Mr. Card's best series. And I thouroughly, enjoyed the continuation of one of the best fantasy series that I have had the pleasure of reading. Cheers to you Mr. Card. I patiently await the continuation of the Alvin Maker series."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I thought Card was losing his way with \\"Heartfire,\\" but it was such a good adventure saga I overlooked its weak points (e.g., an annoying Balzac; little development of overall plot). Not true with \\"The Crystal City,\\" where all that happens is Alvin Smith getting himself one step closer to creating Nauvoo and to getting himself shot in a Carthage City jail. The characters are worth the effort to read, but so many things have been left behind. The love of Margaret and Alvin, so important in \\"Prentice Alvin\\" and \\"Heartfire,\\" is practically non-existent. So too the Unmaker. Where is Cavil Planter? What happened to Verily and Purity?However, I will continue to read the books in this series. I know Card's got at least one more, and I'm dying to figure out how he works polygamy and destruction of private property (e.g., printing presses) into his plot. I just wish he'd finish the same thing he started. If he has to kill Alvin off at the end, I accept that, just so long as he's true to the series doing it."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"It's been a while since I last read any Alvin-books, and I think \\"The Crystal City\\" might have felt better had I read the previous ones first to refresh my memory. It doesn't work all that well as a stand-alone, but, of course, it would be pointless to expect that from book 6 in a supposedly 7-book series.\\"The Crystal City\\" had pretty much all those things I have grown to love during the series, and many of the annoying bits as well. I expected Calvin would've gained a bit of common sense after \\"Heartfire\\", but unfortunately I was wrong - there has hardly been any character evolution for him, he's always stuck being the completely selfish and stupid little brother. Luckily, after some thoughts that ominously remind Calvin's, Arthur Stuart gets a good arc and truly gives the feeling that he's growing up. Peggy gets the ungrateful part of the anxious expecting mother and is, in my opinion, a bit too whiney and passive in this part of the series. Alvin, on the other hand, has had the problem of being a bit omnipotent, and I liked it that there were moments when he wasn't able to fix everything, and got into dangerous situations that actually felt dangerous instead of something that he could manage with a passing thought.Plotwise, this book continues the saga logically, sees the return of several old acquintances and the entrance of several interesting characters who will probably play a noticeable role in the next part, and most of all, as the name suggests, offers some real revelations. And it's an enjoyable read with a good balance of action, humour and drama, although it certainly has the problematic feel of a middle part, something that actually doesn't have a beginning or an end and only leaves the reader with more questions and high expectations for the next one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"It pains me to give this book only 3 stars because I love Orson Scott Card's writing so much, however I didn't feel that this final installment of the Alvin Maker series (was it the last one? It sure didn't seem like it) was quite as good as its predecessors. The plot flow seemed almost elementary compared to Card's usual standard, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the ending didn't seem to conclude the series. I definitely have to say this is the worst book by this author I have ever read (although it is by no means bad, considering all that it has to live up to). It's probably a must-read for those who have already enjoyed the Alvin Maker series, but it's unfortunate that Card chose to end this saga with a mediocre book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"The story begins by with a huge knowledge gap between this and the previous book. Some years have passed and the character dynamics have changed considerably without much in the way of background being provided. Similarly, the book ends leaving the reader with the distinct feeling that there is room for another book. That is, the story is not finished. I felt that the book was unworthy of the previous five and appeared to be written to fulfill a contractual obligation. I did not feel as though the author's heart was really in it (in fact, it could almost have been written by somebody else) although it is a good yarn. Orson Scott Card fans must read the series, but be prepared for some disappointment with this last book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"After waiting four years for the sequel to Heartfire, Orson Scott Card finally delights us with the further tales of Alvin Maker in The Crystal City. From the beginning, we are transported into the wonderful world of magical alternate history as only Uncle Orson can show us. Alvin and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, are in the Spanish town Nueva Barcelona (once known as New Orleans) on a mission of unknown determination, by Alvin's wife, the \\"Torch,\\" Peggy Smith.Card writes in his usual Alvin series voice, providing frequent jabs and slapstick conversation among the characters, who argue among themselves in admiration. Although I think the snappy dialogue went a tad overboard in this book, I was nevertheless entertained with the story.The book is an easy read, and went too quickly. After the early difficulties in the book, I think things wrapped together far too neatly toward the end. And it appeared that Card was rushing this one. It seems that something has been left out.I have to remind myself that the Alvin books are written easily, so that youth can read them, and not be upset that we didn't explore the depths of characters who should be behaving like adults.At 340 pages, it's well worth the short time it takes to read it. I understand that Orson Scott Card has one more book in the series and then he'll wrap it all up. Let's hope he takes less than four years to write this one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I was very much looking forward to this novel after having read the other books in the series. I avoid purchasing hardbacks whenever possible, but I decided to give in to my need to hear the rest of the story.What I loved about the series was the world that Orson Scott Card created, which is still present in this book, but the magic of the world is not there.The other novels felt more like a complex journey, literally of travelling and spiritually to look at one's purpose in the world. This book lacked that insight and left me feeling that it was just filler and/or a way to close out the series.I don't regret having purchased the book but I do have to admit I was disappointed. I am a long time reader of OSC's novels and I have at least one more waiting to be read but I would suggest that you check this one out from the library. I would also suggest that you do finish the series if you started to finally see the city."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This is the sixth book in the ingenious Alvin Maker series. In this alternate North America of the 1850s, folk magics work. Blacks make charms from personal items, Reds use the forces of nature, and Whites have knacks; inborn magical talents. Alvin Maker, born Alvin Miller and known as Alvin Smith, is the seventh son of a seventh son and was expected to have an ususually strong knack. He is even stronger than that: apprenticed as a blacksmith, he discovers he has the powers of Maker, one who understands the essences of all things and can manipulate them. Yet as this book begins, Alvin is despairing again, because despite his awesome powers, he was unable to save he prematurely born child.If you're reading these book reviews, there's an excellent chance that you've read books 1-5 already, and want to know whether this book finally hits the money note. Does Alvin finally get to build his Crystal City? Does he at least figure out how he will do it, or where, or with whose help? And is this book worth reading?If you've read the other five books, yes, you should get this one. It has much more plot and character development than the fifth book, Heartfire. In the last volume, Alvin dithered and fretted about how he was going to build his city, but didn't find himself any closer to his goal; he didn't even find himself closer to beginning it. In Crystal City, Alvin begins on another vague errand, sent by his future-seeing wife who is doing her best to avoid an all-out war she sees in almost every possible path.Alvin meets two of Peggy's abolitionist friends in Neuva Barcelona, the unfortunately named Moose and Squirrel. (This odd reference to Rocky and Bullwinkle is merely another of Card's fans on his Hatrack River discussion group; some of the other books suffered by including characters from the bulletin board whether or not they advanced the plot.) And once again, Alvin's attempt to improve things makes them worse. By curing an old woman dying from yellow fever, Alvin finds the entire city now under threat from the plague. And by keeping Moose, Squirrel and their 55 children (of various races, their household is an illegal school for blacks so they follow the letter of the law by not allowing the children to recite their lessons aloud) healthy while all around them are dying, their neighbors pay more attention to the unusual domecile.Several characters from the previous books return, including Tenskwa-Tawa (the Red Prophet of volume 2), Jim Bowie and Steve Austin, and Verily Cooper. Calvin reappears in Barcy, still seething with resentment toward his older brother. Arthur Stuart is growing into a man and discovering his abilities are more than anyone expected from him. Some strong new characters develop in this work, especially La Tia, a voodoo queen with powers rivalling his own, who gives Alvin a much more ambitious mission than he ever expected.We also meet this universe's Abraham Lincoln, but I think that was not an effective device. Most charcters from Alvin's part of the world take a new last name when they enter a profession, yet the historical characters Lincoln, Bowie and Austin did not. It would have been better if they had more appropriate monickers, and let us figure out who they were supposed to be (I'm thinking of Turtledove's alternate America where the CSA remains a separate country; many of his historical cameos are not fully identified).This is clearly not the last book of the series, but we are getting closer to the end. Alvin learns more about himself, his abilities and limits, and how to teach others to work toward a common goal. Yet the book ends with plenty of unresolved familial and political tensions, so there's at least another novel waiting. It would be appropriate to finish this series about a seventh son of a seventh son with book... seven."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Another chapter in the saga of Alvin Maker that seems to have no objective, form or substance. As I read this book I continually wondered when I would finally get to a part with some interest or relevance, I never found it. Follow Alvin as he whups up on the nasty white man and saves the blacks, injuns and French. Oh yeah, he starts to build his crystal city but not in any way you might have expected.Is it bad? No. What it is is boring. Too bad, I have been following this story from the very beginning and really enjoyed most of it. There must be some extremely virulent disease going through the fantasy/SF community that has wiped out the ability of many writers to actually finish stories. Hopefully they will come up with a cure soon.Unfortunately it will be too late for this one. It is DOA, terminally boring. I can't in all good conscience recommend this one, even to Mr. Cards most fevered fans. Hopefully he will put this puppy to sleep in his next volume."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I enjoyed the realization of the Crystal City at long last, While Alvin had some new troubles and seems to have lost some of his abilities It was great to see the evolution of the altered history. Alvin placed the Crystal City where Joseph Smith built Navoo, of course this is a parallel, I wonder how the future will unfold now? Is Arthur Stuart a Maker because of Alvin's Teachings or because he has altered DNA? With So much Makery going on Peggy should give up trying to predict the future, or at least stop worring about it! What will America be after the war to come? What combination of factors will make Alvin willing to allow himself to die? Why on Earth wont he just make another plow of ordinary gold to get teh law off his back! It is a wonderful series, I love all of Card's Novels but this series makes me wish he did nothing else!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I really am enjoying the entire series. Orson Scott Card is a very good writer. If you are looking for a bit of mysticism, spirituality, tradition and alternate worlds-enter here"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"The Crystal City is the sixth novel in the Tales of Alvin Maker series, following Heartfire. In the previous volume, Alvin and Verily Cooper convinced Judge Adams that the witchcraft charges brought against Purity Orphan and Alvin were backed only by hearsay and outright perjury and that their knacks were given by God upon birth, so the court suspended the licenses for all interrogators (or witchers) for their grievous malfeasance in office. Since a licensed interrogator was required to prosecute a witchcraft charge, Judge Adams dismissed all charges against Purity and Alvin pending restoral of such licenses.Immediately after completion of the trial, Alvin and Arthur ran with the greensong toward Camelot to rescue Calvin and Peggy. Since Calvin was close to dying, Peggy convinced Gullah Joe to use powerful potions to raise Calvin to consciousness. Peggy then coaxed Calvin (with a little remote help from Alvin) into flooding the land near the river, thus driving all of the agitated slaves to higher ground. Thereupon, Peggy talked Calvin into storing his heartfire within a magical box just prior to his death. When Alvin arrived, he managed to repair enough of Calvin's corpse to support a small trickle of heartfire back into the corpse, which kept the repaired parts working while he moved on to repair other parts, until Calvin was restored to full life.Despite Peggy's best efforts, King Arthur and his advisors refused to listen to her explanation that the uprising was an unfortunate accident resulting in no real harm. Instead, they insisted on making an example of the slaves who had stirred up so much fear. John Calhoun wanted to hang a third of the slaves, but was finally convinced to execute only twenty of those involved in the uprising. When the news of these executions reached the northern territories, however, a great public outcry was raised against any further accommodations with the slaveholders.In this novel, Peggy is pregnant again and living in her father's roadhouse, but she has sent Alvin and Arthur down the Mizzippy to Neuva Barcelona -- i.e., New Orleans -- in an attempt to avoid the upcoming war over slavery. On the trip down the river, they have had several enlightening experiences and met a number of interesting people, including a failed storekeeper from Noisy River named Abe Lincoln. They also have had another encounter with Jim Bowie, a killer with a big knife who plans to join Steven Austin's expedition into Mexico.After reaching New Orleans, they find lodgings with Mama Squirrel, Papa Moose and their dozens of kids in a large boarding house. While they wait for some sign of their task, Alvin and Arthur help with the chores and gather information with the help of the kids and soon find that Neuva Barcelona is filled with plots and conspiracies. One day, as they are getting water from a public foundation, a young woman named Dead Mary asks Alvin to heal her mama, Rien, who has yellow fever. While not sure of his ability to cure the disease, Alvin goes with the young woman to a shack in swamp and repairs all the damage that he can discover with his doodlebug, focusing particularly on her liver and blood vessels, and clears away the rotting blood under her skin.Alvin's gross repairs help Rien to heal her own body, but doesn't even touch the disease itself. Rien becomes a carrier of the infection that spreads via the swamp mosquitoes throughout the city. As the disease spreads, Alvin continues to heal as many people as possible in the area around his lodgings, but other people notice that there is a circle of wellness centered on his boarding house. A crowd gathers around the building with torches, egged on by rumors spread by Jim Bowie. Then Arthur uses his knack to extinguish all the torches and the crowd gets really spooked and runs away.Alvin is summoned by the local voodooienne, La Tia, and learns that the townsmen are working themselves into a mob which will attack others in addition to his friends and himself. She says that he must lead an exodus of slaves and poor out of Neuva Barcelona. Calvin helps by shrouding the city in fog, then Alvin and Arthur lead the crowd of thousands out of the city and across Lake Pontchartrain on a bridge made of crystallized water. Gathering more migrants as they go, Alvin takes them all to the future site of the Crystal City.This story reflects the flight of the Hebrews from Egypt as well as the repeated escapes of Joseph Smith and his followers from persecution. The people following Alvin are not only black slaves, but also free colored and poor creoles. They are escaping not just de jure slavery, but also a climate of de facto persecution that limits their freedoms and threatens their lives.This migration culminates all prior efforts by Alvin to break the social constraints of class, color and wealth. This exodus does not wrest their promised land from the prior inhabitants, but instead tames an unwanted wilderness which they then open to all others who wish to settle there. Their new freedom will not be at the expense of others.This volume ends with the first foundations of the new utopia, but already the snakes have started to gather. The new city may be a paradise, but all the people therein will not be paragons of virtue. The next volume in this series should indicate how Alvin will handle dissent and corruption in the Crystal City.Highly recommended for Card fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of temptation, morality and social justice among people with powerful and fantastic talents.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"i loved this book, it was really great i could hardely put it down. it's funny how it has history in it and how they play it into the book so that it actually makes some sense. i really liked arthurs character, he was so funny and reminded me a lot of my brother. it had so much suspence in it. it's a great book that people should just read to give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Like other readers I eagerly awaited the release of \\"The Crystal City.\\" But unlike other readers I was disappointed in the book. At its best is it excellent in the story layout and characters. It was classic \\"Card\\" but I thought he tried too hard to bring in components of the first five books and that detracted from the story line a great deal.Lets face it. We are avid readers of the \\"Maker\\" series and so much detail from previous books just pumped up the page count. I found the ending the most disappointing of all. When I hit the last page I felt as if I should be able to turn the page and finish reading the ending and it just was not there.What he did do was make me look forward to the next book to see how this one should have ended. It is worth the buy for sure, but you may be upset at how it ends..."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"The Crystal City amazes. It's a perfect follow-up to the other books in the series, and it may very well be one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Mr. Card is simply the best writer of his generation and perhaps one of the best in the world. I believe that this book will garner Mr. Card hundreds of thousands of more fans than he already has. I loved this book; I was enthralled all the way through. I even bought three copies to pass along to friends. This book will change your life and make you a fan . . . if you aren't already one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"The book was in great condition (I think it was new) and got here fast! I'd buy again in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"In a world where magical &quot;knacks&quot; flourish, Alvin as expected of the seventh son of a seventh son is a Maker, who understands the essence of things. He can invent, fix, or destroy. This includes healing or killing people.Alvin's wife, the talented Peggy sees a future devastated by war and disease. She concludes that only her beloved has a chance to avert a pandemic disaster. She is not sure why she sends him to Nueva Barcelona (formerly New Orleans), accompanied by Arthur, his half black brother-in-law pretending to be his slave. They await a sign while staying with abolitionist friends of Peggy. When the plague strikes the Spanish controlled city, Alvin keeps his hosts, much of the poor, and Arthur disease free, but not necessarily safe. Still the real quest has begun. Alvin, seventh son of a seventh son, seeks his long ago vision of the Crystal City, a place where death awaits him.Volume six of the Alvin Maker alternate earth fantasy series is an exciting tale that can stand alone, but is better read after perusing its predecessors as THE CRYSTAL CITY rapidly moves forward the quest of the hero. Old favorites like the Red Prophet (see volume two) return and Moose and Squirrel amongst others help propel the adventure forward while other cast members enhance the understanding of the essence of Alvin Maker. Still as with the previous five tomes, this book belongs to the hero who must cross troubled waters without adequate bridges (or Simon and Garfunkle - not born yet) as the author pulls out the Ace of Spades from his deck.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This applies to the whole series. I enjoyed reading it, but I doubt I'll ever re-read it. At the end of this book I was left feeling unsatisfied. Orson Scott Card seems to be able to start series with a lot of promise but never seems to be able to finish them. They just sort of peter out."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I read straight through all six books because they were that good...until I got to the sixth. It almost felt as though Card made it up as he went along; as though there was a disconnect to what had come before. Too much was left hanging and not completed. I felt cheated. Even if at the time, Card planned another series to go into the future, it was poor.The subplots were weak, some sidetracks into different ventures went nowhere, which, in my mind, did nothing but flesh out the alternative history, and the story meandered around until they SUDDENLY reached the promised land . Alternative Histories naturally change history and portray another reality. However, I think Card failed dismally in how he portrayed Abe Lincoln. For me, it didn't work. Maybe because some people should be left alone.After the whole buildup of searching for how to build the Crystal City, the book had a weak ending. I understand that life gets in the way of miracles, but by the time everyone was in place, the city was being built, the golden plow had revealed its purpose, there could at least have been something exciting to mark the event. Instead, Alvin spends time moaning about how things are going to fail, Peggy cries because she sees his future, but won't tell him, (What else is new?), and Calvin shows up completely unchanged. Or maybe, as readers, we're supposed to supply our own ending...like Arthur Steward will become powerful enough that he will overcome the evil brother Calvin and save Alvin's life, even though Alvin's full of bullet holes.Sounds like the unmaker wrote the sixth book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"A lot of people obviously had a negative reaction to this final volume in the saga of Alvin Maker. Instead, I'd like to applaud Card for this difficult effort to wrap up a complex and much-loved series. I know it wasn't an easy task, but it was absolutely demanded by fans of this wonderfully imaginative world. While much of the wonder of the story has faded, and this ending certainly seems rushed towards an easy conclusion, this is still a good book, providing adequate closure to the series. Here's props to OSC for finding a way to tie up all the loose ends and finally bringing this story to a close.As most of the readers of the series know, this story wasn't initially planned to get as far as it has. After the first three books, Card let the story rest and didn't know if he'd ever come back to it. After much encouragement by fans of the series, he decided to bring it back. At some point after that, he must have decided to bring it all the way to a conclusion. I know it is hard to believe, but when Card initially wrote about the vision of the Crystal City inRed Prophet, he didn't really have a firm idea of where that promise would really lead, much less how he would actually get his young character Alvin there. Similarly, many of the other grand events that were foreshadowed throughout the series were not fully formed ideas when they were promised, and left Card with a daunting task to complete this series in a fulfilling way.In THE CRYSTAL CITY, the plot is obviously directed and limited towards a definite conclusion to the overall story. The previous couple of books, notablyHeartfire, seemed to aimlessly wander, introducing new plot threads and characters that really didn't add anything to the series as a whole, but rather seemed to be filler for a series that the author wasn't sure where to take or how to finish. Finally, in this book, Card had made up his mind to finish the story and just did it. No fooling around, no stretching it out, just completing the story.This book does come across as rushed, set on a crash-course for the inevitable ending that no reader doubted could be much different than it turned out. And there was an obvious effort to wrap up loose ends of the story in the most efficient (or easiest) way possible. And sure there are a few plot threads from the previous books that were radically altered or just allowed to fade into the forgotten. But this book at least brings a satisfactory closing to a much-loved series.So, with THE CRYSTAL CITY, Card successfully brings his beloved story to an end, mercifully putting a series that had lost its inspiration to rest. Fans of the series should enjoy the closure to the story. Readers new to the series are encouraged to pick upSeventh Son, and let the magic begin."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Card's \`Alvin Maker' series takes us down an alternate timeline to a pre-industrial America where folk magic competes with religion and science as the path to success. If you haven't read the first two volumes: \`Seventh Son' and \`Red Prophet' leave this page now and go check them out. Not only will further installments make little sense without that background, but they're nowhere near as good, and once again, this one is certainly no exception. The bottom line on the series is this - if you liked Volume 3, \`Alvin Journeyman', where the drop in quality first began, you'll probably like the rest, too, although it seems to this reviewer as though each new addition is just a little weaker than the previous one.In this volume, Alvin brings his people - the outcasts, the enslaved, and the downtrodden - across the great river to the site where he will build his long-awaited Crystal City. Hallelujah! At last something is happening in this series. Unfortunately, what's happening is not very exciting, and it's taken us yet another complete volume to get there. On the plus side, Card's prose is always easy reading, and fans of the series will probably get through this tome pretty quickly. But if Card plans to continue with this series (and it would be a serious mistake if he didn't since the end of this installment is pretty weak) he needs a payoff that makes all this buildup seem worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Loved all of the books in this series and all the way up to the end it was a great journey but it sort of felt unfinished. I wish that there was more to the ending."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I have never read an OSC book I didn't like. This one is one of the better ones, though. The characters (as always with Card) are well developed and easy to care about, the situations are bizarre and engrossing (Alvin meets Abe Lincoln in this one), and the book leaves you wanting more. I read this in three days. Why didn't I give it five stars? Well, because I've read Ender's Game and The Lord of the Rings and a few other classics, which this book does not measure up to. It didn't leave a strong impression on me, but it was about as entertaining as books get anyway. Not something that will stick with you forever, but it's thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"For those of us eagerly waiting to learn what happens next to Alvin Maker, &quot;The Crystal City&quot; does not toy with us. In this, the sixth novel in the Alvin Maker series, all of the previous elements come into play. Alvin's work is far from done at the end of this book, but Card has fulfilled much of his promise to his readers. As we watch Alvin's dreams become real we also watch the author's. He continues to thrill us with famous characters in this alternate history. The rich dialects stick with me, and I catch them in my speech for days.Once again Orson Scott Card skillfully recaps the action of the previous books through the thoughts of his characters, so we learn even more about the past. Readers will benefit from reading the previous books in the series first. (Seventh Son, Red Prophet, Prentice Alvin, Alvin Journeyman, and Heartfire) The only flaw of this book is that it tries to cover too much of the story within two covers.Card has developed as a writer throughout this series. Each novel in this series is different from the others. &quot;The Crystal City&quot; is not primarily a story of action (although there is no shortage of miraculous actions). Instead it is a story of relationships-- trust, love, forgiveness, and hope. There is no final battle with the Unmaker at the end of this tale, and some readers may be disappointed by that. But there is triumph nonetheless. While I would eagerly read future books in the Alvin Maker series, I shall be content if this is the end."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"At first, I was wary of this book-- my problem with Orson Scott Card is that he can't finish a series-- Children of the mind was horriffic, as was xenocide- so I was a bit nervous when I picked up The Crystal City. This book however, is a strong addition (and end?) to the Alvin Maker series-- by far, his best series (as a whole) to date. It ties up many loose ends, and ends on a positive note. As always, Card's writing sucks you into his world-- i couldn't put this book down. Some minor problems:1. It's a pretty good stand-alone book, but there are some parts where the reader might get confused if they have not read the other books in the Alvin Maker series (read them!)2. Alvin Maker's archnemesis-- the Unmaker, seemed not much more than an afterthought-- there are few worthy enemies in this story, (and not as much conflict) which sorely disappointed me. Mr. Card's forte is his character studies, and the book falls short in this area3. There was no real resolution-- the book ends on a happy note, which is odd, given how many times disaster is foretold throughout the story.my only hope is thus that the ending was left open because he plans to write another book in the series-- if not, it is a disappointing ending."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"When his wife sends him to New Barcelona (New Orleans), Alvin Maker goes even though he is uncertain of his goal. What he discovers is Yellow Fever and oppression. Even Alvin's 'maker' powers are unable to completely defeat the disease, but he resolves to do something about the oppression faced by slaves, freed blacks, and the French inhabitants of the city. Like Moses, Alvin must find a way to lead the oppressed into a promised land. Unlike the Israelites, however, Alvin's task is doubly challenging because he doesn't want to violate laws and force other people out of their country.Along with his friends, Abraham Lincoln and Arthur Stuart--who is quickly becoming a maker himself, Alvin struggles to find a path. Unfortunately, Alvin's brother Calvin, Steve Austin, and Jim Bowie have other plans and do everything they can to hamper Alvin. And Alvin's pregnant wife looks into the future and sees only destruction and death for everything that she and Alvin have fought for. But although the power of the unmaker is overwhelming, Alvin refuses to give up his dream of a Crystal City of Makers, working together to build something wonderful and something that will last beyond his own death.Author Orson Scott Card creates a wonderful and enduring character in Alvin Maker. Card has become one of the best SF/Fantasy authors writing today and THE CRYSTAL CITY reflects Card at the height of his power. Although THE CRYSTAL CITY is an engrossing read, for me it lacks some of the pure emotional power of the earlier novels in this series. In THE RED PROPHET and ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, for example, I often found myself in tears at the pure power of the story. CRYSTAL CITY falls somewhat short of this. That doesn't, however, make the novel less than engrossing and enjoyable.If you're new to this series, you'll find your enjoyment enhanced by starting at the beginning, SEVENTH SON. If you've been following the series, you'll definitely want to read this one."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I love, love, love Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, but he is just pushing it now. It's time to let it go man! This book isn't a complete waste of time, but it's not something I would read instead of say, doing laundry. It's just not that good."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I felt a little let down by \\"Crystal City.\\" The quality of the writing and of the characters is still excellent: that's not the issue. But it just didn't feel very climactic for what seems like it ought to be the last book in the series. Maybe if it hadn't been named \\"Crystal City\\" I'd have felt better about it being just a link in the chain.I also found myself scratching my head and wondering if I'd missed a book in between Heartfire and Crystal City. There seems to have been at least a year in between the stories, which in any of itself isn't a problem except that they keep referring to things that happened - the death of a baby, Arthur's breakthrough, meeting Abe and Coz, rescuing a boatload of slaves, the splitting up of the Verily / Fink / Alvin / Arthur / Audobon crew, Peggy's acquaintence with Squirel and Moose... there seems to be a good book or two in there that we didn't get to read. Maybe he will fill in some gaps later the way he's done with Ender's universe?Finally, the Crystal City story itself just didn't seem to be long enough. There was so much going on that didn't really get much detail - especially the role of Abe, Coz, and Verily in getting the charter, the invasion of Mexico, Arthur's return, the journey north, etc. It almost felt like some of those details were too boring to write about... but that doesn't make sense considering the time he spent on similar topics in \\"Journeyman\\" and even \\"Heartfire.\\"The book ended in such a way that we were left hopeful for another installment. I certainly hope we get one: as a climax for a really great series, this just didn't fit the bill."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"In _The Crystal City_, Orson Scott Card's 6th book in the Alvin Maker series, Alvin starts an epidemic and builds a bridge, Arthur Stuart gets kissed and runs to Mexico and back, Calvin postures, Verily sulks and Margaret sighs. That's about it.Before embarking on _The Crystal City_ I went back and reread the entire series, as it had been five years or so since I was through them last and I wanted to be sure everything was fresh. I was, once more, delighted by the voice with its smooth use of early American colloquialism, impressed by the obvious knowledge of history and folklore that went into them, captivated by the engaging characters and astounded by the scope of the work. &quot;Boy,&quot; I thought, &quot;This is one Great Series!&quot;Then I came to the current volume. And I was really disappointed. It purely does not compare with its companions in any way. The story was frankly boring and the Biblical allegory--which was very suave and subtle in the earlier works-- was just ham-handed. I don't object to Alvin's spending the entire book leading a group of slaves to freedom, but it doesn't make for very interesting action and the subplots weren't developed enough to alleviate the tedium. The language was mundane, without any of the personality I had come to expect. The earlier books seemed to be told by a breathing human being; TCC resembled a recitation by a history prof counting the days until retirement. The characters were flat. The characters we had seen before were not developed any further and the new characters were not developed at all. In previous books even minor characters had personalities and stories, but only lip service was paid to that here: note the stunning difference between _Heartfire's_ Denmark and TCC's Old Bart. Historical characters were inserted to fill the formula, but not even Abe Lincoln really added anything. And as for Papa Moose and Mama Squirrel, well, I read the reason for them in the Acknowledgements, but I personally think using those names was a REALLY BAD CHOICE. Every reference to &quot;moose and squirrel&quot; catapaulted me into a realm that had nothing to do with Alvin Maker and Co. I'm sure you know the one I mean.I don't mind that TCC started about five years after _Heartfire_ and that Alvin was in a really different place than one might have expected. I do mind that the story behind this wasn't really told. It's as if Tolkein had finished FOTR with leaving Lorien, skipped TTT altogether and started ROTK with &quot;Well, now that Saruman's been vanquished...&quot; There was just a huge chunk missing, and I think that chunk would have been a great deal more interesting than the story Card chose to tell. It almost seems to me that Card has written himself into a corner with this series; his characters can no longer grow and change and have real human experiences because that might tarnish them. Good and bad are established, but there are no longer any of the shades of grey that make people interesting.Though TCC ends with some events that foreshadow a possible cotinuation of this series, it also sums up enough -- with &quot;curtain call&quot; appearances by most major characters fromt he series -- that Card could stop here without much harm done. Unless he makes some radical choices for this universe, I hope he does stop. I really wouldn't like to see this series devolve any further. The spark is gone and laying this series to rest before it decays would be a mercy."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"The sixth book of the Tales of Alvin Maker feels a lot like the increasingly tired books at the end of the Ender series. It's not that the book is boring--I read it in two sittings--but although the plot is fine, it's simply not as well crafted as the earlier volumes in the series, and it shows. For one, the earlier books had a distinctive narrator, a sort of folksy presence that was clearly of the world of the book, but that is completely absent from this book, making the book read more like notes for a screen play than a coherent whole. Secondly, there's no overarching plot arc that makes this book stand alone the way the others in the series could--it feels more like the collected other adventures of Alvin Maker, and not like a coherent whole where the plot tensions pull the book to its conclusions. Third, the book has a strange quality that it does not take place immediately after the events in Heartfire. There's nothing wrong with that, per se--it might even be interesting, except that in this case a lot of the emotional tension from the previous book is just gone. Peggy and Alvin are separated again, their baby stillborn, and although you are told about Alvin's guilt in not being able to save his child you don't get to see it, and it carries little weight--it feels for most of the book that they've drifted apart, but I'm not sure that's the intention. At the end of the last book, Verily Cooper has found new love, but Purity is almost entirely gone from this book, with some hints that their romance went nowhere. Calvin is back, but all the rapproachment between him and Alvin is gone--which is probably realistic, but very unsatisfying after the last book where we see a seachange in Alvin's brother. Because of the flat narrative voice and this bizarre missing chapters, the book tells us a lot, but shows us nothing, and as a result, we don't feel at all like we're there, the way Card mananges to do in the previous five books. The first five books are so exceptional, so satisfying, that it is probably not surprising that it was hard to sustain it further, but I hope that if Card gives his readers another installment, he will care more about the craft that makes his best books worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Alvin Maker, or Smith, still after five books has not found himself or the Crystal City of which he dreams. Sent to Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) by his wife Peggy, he more or less accidently becomes Moses to an Exodus of slaves and other downtrodden people. With yellow fever and soldiers not far behind, and the seemingly impenetrable Mizzippi ahead, he must try to lead these people to freedom. Meanwhile, his uncontrollable younger brother, Calvin, is stirring up trouble on an expedition to conquer Mexico . . .Good, but not great, continuation of the Alvin Maker series. As you can tell by the title, Alvin finally begins his Crystal City (and not surprisingly, since much in this series parallels Latter Day Saints beliefs, it seems to be on the site of Nauvoo, Illinois.)While we meet Abraham Lincoln in this series (an Abe who apparently did not buy a barrel of law books at a cheap price to enable him to study law on his own), Lincoln's explanation as to why he doesn't have a last name reflecting his profession is weak. Most of the people who don't have such last names are historical characters in our world (William Henry Harrison, for example). It's not a new complaint, but--Card should have thought this through. He's inventive enough.With Alvin seeming to parallel Joseph Smith, and with his people defying the U.S. to some extent, the groundwork seems to be laid for this universe's equivalent of the U.S. attack on Nauvoo and death of Joseph Smith, which eventually led to Brigham Young and his people's trek to Utah. How this will play out in Card's works should be interesting.Finally, Card really, really, should update his political maps to show the developments he has mentioned through the series--the new states, the closing-off of the Trans-Mizzippi, etc. The maps are the same as at the start of the series, though this book's version does show Springfield and Crystal City--the latter on the WEST bank of the Mizzippi. It's more an annoyance than anything else.Recommended, if you've read the previous five."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"It's been five years since the last installment in this series, which is a long time without fuel to maintain the energy and enthusiasm this series originally engendered. As an alternate history where people have 'knacks' for doing things, from repairing barrels and bones to seeing the future, its fire came from its ideological underpinnings, of the fight between those who build and those who destroy, of machine versus nature, of the rights of all to be self-directing autonomous individuals versus the cultural assumption that some are better than others, and those inferior beings are suited only for slavery. While much of this underpinning is highly relevant to this latest installment, it does not seem to bring with it the deep emotional involvement that would have made this story come alive.Alvin Maker is the prime mover here, a man conflicted between his incredible abilities and the knowledge that regardless of how much he builds, however much good he can accomplish in the world, the Unmaker will be following right behind, tearing down all he can accomplish. Alvin's dream of a city built by Makers seems further and further off, as he becomes embroiled in actions to save many of the slaves and poor of the city of Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) from both yellow fever (that he unwittingly helped to spread) and its other bigoted and superstitious citizens. Almost as a side plot, his brother Calvin becomes embroiled in a foray by Steve Austin and Jim Bowie to conquer the Mexica, with Calvin's typical disregard for the consequences or moral rightness of his actions.The depiction of the historical characters that dot this novel, from Abe Lincoln to Bowie, is definitely problematic. All of them seem to have no depth, all are portrayed with only the sheen of their legendary characteristics, from Abe's honesty to Bowie's fighting drive, with no signs of other human foibles that would have made these stick-figures into something real. The plot itself is reasonable, a modern alternate version of Exodus with Alvin as Moses, and its final resolution points the way towards where this series may ultimately be headed. But I found as I was reading that I was looking for something more concrete to the action; too little description, not enough supporting details, an almost dreamlike feel to what could have been a very gritty slice of life under very unappetizing conditions.While Card has a long list of those people who helped check this manuscript for continuity errors with earlier volumes, and obviously their efforts did help eliminate most of those kinds of problems, I did find it a little amusing that the maps on the end papers clearly show Alvin's Crystal City located on the wrong side of the Mississippi river.Card does manage to make most of his moral points without clobbering you over the head with them, and some of the final section shows at least a willingness to concede that not all that is man-made is bad or that all that is nature-derived is good. But the fire that drove the earlier books, of their implied Great War between good and evil, is not here. Clearly, Card is planning at least one more book in this set, where perhaps the anticipated and long delayed war against slavery will combine with Alvin's dream of a better world to form a heart-wrenching finale. I do hope so.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Like the Ender seriers did with Children of the Mind and the Homecoming series did with Earthborn, the Alvin Maker series sputters to a conclusion (hopefully) in The Crystal City.Not that this book was terrible, but it just didn't seem to have any purpose other than gettin Alvin and his followers to the Crystal City, and there just wasn't anything interesting enough that happened along the way. I think they were all too good, and too powerful, that you knew they would always do the right thing, and you also knew that they always could, so there wasn't any doubt about the conclusion.If you've read the rest of the series, you'll probably want to read this book just for closure, just don't expect much."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I had to go back and see how long it had been since Uncle Orson had published the last volume in the Tales of Alvin Maker, but I waited until after I read Book 6, &quot;The Crystal City.&quot; It had been about five years, but without ever going back and jogging my memory I was able to pick up the narrative thread in the ongoing story. Besides, I was encouraged by both the title and the cover art for this novel that Alvin was finally going to take that golden plough out of his poke and finally lay the ground for his city, and in that regard I am not disappointed. However, this is still not the climax of the tale.Orson Scott Card's Tales of Alvin Maker series is set in an alternative America where some people are born with knacks, a magical ability that is both a great gift and a deep burden. Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a &quot;maker,&quot; who can make things and fix things, using his doodlebug to get a sense of what needs to be done. After the death of his newborn son, Alvin is persuaded by his wife, Peggy (a &quot;torch,&quot; who can see the various paths into the future that a life might take), to go to Barcy (the New Orleans of this world), and so he travels down the Mizzizippy with young Arthur Stuart on a flatboat with Abe Lincoln and his friend Coz.This matters because while Alvin Maker has his dream of the Crystal City, Peggy is concerned with preventing the great war that she sees coming over the issues of slavery. In this America the United States is put one of several &quot;countries&quot; competing for the North American continent. The south consists of Crown Colonies, Spain controls Florida and Nueva Barcelona (Louisiana), and the French still have Canada. Meanwhile, the descendants of the Aztecs are still performing human sacrifices in Mexica and Alvin's friend, Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet, controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy. Beyond the Hio Territory where Alvin was born in Hatrack River, the Wobbish Territory where Vigor Church and Carthage City can be found, and even beyond the Noisy River Territory, Alvin needs to find a place for his Crystal City. Because when he saves a single life in Barcy, the act changes everything and forces a series of issues. The establishment of the Crystal City is obviously a major moment in the series, but clearly it is not the big payoff.As always, it is interesting to see Uncle Orson's take on some of the figures of American's history. If he liked John Adams, he likes Abraham Lincoln any more. However, Stephen Austin and Jim Bowie do not fare well, and Alvin has to worry about the latter almost as much as he does about his younger brother Calvin. I know there are those who want to read these stories as a religious allegory, but I have enjoyed taking the narrative at face value and I remain ignorant enough of the major tenets of Mormon theology so that I do not see anything more here than the American ideal dressed up in alternative clothing. However, I find it hard to believe that there is only one volume left in the series, because there seem to be too many threads left to weave together."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Its been a long time since I read the earlier books in this series, so many of the details of the earlier events have become fuzzy. Consequently, I was concerned about picking this up and finding myself confused by jumping into the middle of the story. Happily, this book stands well enough on its own that this didn't happen. Card continues to be a terrific storyteller, with compelling characters who make you care about what happens to them. His alternate history, based on a reality in which magic is real, is also convincing and provides a thoroughly interesting backdrop to his story. However, it is the character interactions in this book that are the most enjoyable. The dialog is filled with verbal swordplay that is both biting and funny, and which also sounds true to life. The only criticism I can offer for this book is that the ending, while hopeful, is also so open ended that it practically screams that Card intends to continue writing books for this series."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"First, some background on my experience with the whole series: I picked up the Alvin Maker books because I'd just finished the 8th book in the Ender/Shadow series, and was generally happy with all of them. The first three in this series (Seventh Son, Red Prophet, Prentice Alvin) were incredible, and presented rich possibilities for a great sequence, which I assumed would obviously be 7 books. OSC really had some good ingredients for a memorable good/evil epic.Then came the 4th book with its insufferable courtroom drama, poorly-handled romance, annoying developments with Calvin and complete lack of the things which made the first three so great. Well, OK, I thought, maybe he's just got to lay some groundwork for the rest of the series. People love him, people hate him, OK I get it. Now get back to the awesomeness for book 5, please. Instead, what do we get? Another courtroom drama, a near complete lack of maker awesomeness, and a front cover (ppb) that looks like a freaking trashy romance novel, so terrible that I can't read it near other people without being made fun of.Almost despondent, I get book six (The Crystal City). Good, I think: finally we can get back to the maker awesomeness. In one sense, it's there. The bridge, the river, the bricks (don't want to spoil anything by being too specific here) were pretty cool. But as a whole, I was again disappointed! I can't necessarily put a finger on it, but at the end I was just thinking \\"Hmm, so that's it, huh. If he ever makes a book 7 I'll read it, I guess, but if not, meh.\\"I hated the entire Calvin plot right from the beginning, and Peggy is only a good character when she's around, not when she's controlling events from afar or writing stupid love letters. Arthur Stuart had some real potential to be a great character, but since this book takes place several years after the 5th, I think we should have seen more maker awesomeness from him than we got.Furthermore, at this point the use of real historical figures, which at first was pretty cool (Blake, Tecumseh, Harrison) has really started to get tiresome. I put up with John Adams and Daniel Webster as essentially being placeholders in 4&5. I put up with the long ridiculous asides with Adams mentally stacking himself up to the other statesmen, which seemed to me just another way for OSC to explain to us that he hates Thomas Jefferson. I put up with Balzac and Audubon, because at least they had some funny lines. But here, we have Abe Lincoln playing no useful role whatsoever, and Jim Bowie as a one-dimensional bully. Either give these people some life, or just use one of your stock puppet characters instead; you can't make a character instantly interesting by making them a famous person.So now, looking back on it, the progress of the Alvin Maker series gives me context: I can see why I had slight misgivings with the Ender series. It's because the ending sucked, and all the things which made the first two books so good is just gone in the last two. Same for the Shadow series. There's nothing worse than an author who can't fully develop their good ideas."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I have been a huge fan of card for over 20 years, but this book is horrible. I cannot believe card wrote this. The characters seem like flat parodies of the people I loved from the first three books. Quit reading the series after Prentice alvin if you want to keep feeling good about it. How a brilliant premise and three treasured books could be turned to such tripe I will never understand."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I was looking forward this book after having read the first five, an i'm looking forward to another one soon!!! GreatJob Mr. Card"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.The Crystal City is the (maybe) final novel in Orson Scott Card's TALES OF ALVIN MAKER. This series started off strongly with Seventh Son and Red Prophet, but it bogged down during books three and four (Prentice Alvin and Alvin Journeyman) and I was ready to give up. However, since I had already downloaded the audio version of the sixth book, The Crystal City, from my library, I decided to finish the series. (My library didn't have the fifth book, Heartfire, so I just read a plot summary of that one.)Alvin and Peggy are married and have lost a child. Alvin continues his work as a Maker, trying to prepare people for his Crystal City, while Peggy is trying to end slavery. Alvin and Arthur are now in New Orleans. When Alvin heals a woman with yellow fever, she is well enough to go outside and spread it among the city, starting a plague. Alvin tries to heal as many as he can and, in the process, is suspected of witchery. It's looking like a good time to leave New Orleans, so when a woman asks Alvin to lead thousands of runaway slaves and French refugees across the Mississippi river to freedom, he agrees to do it.Thus The Crystal City is the Exodus story and Alvin is both a Moses figure and a Jesus figure. He teams up with his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet, to lead 5,000 people out of slavery and into the promised land. Other highlights include the introductions of Jim Bowie and Abraham Lincoln and, finally, Alvin's dawning understanding of his purpose and the beginnings of the crystal city.The Crystal City was hard to get through for the same reason I had trouble with books three and four in this series. The plot drags because there's too much brooding interior monologue and far too much teasing banter amongst the characters. Almost every conversation on nearly every page of the novel is snarky or sarcastic. This is usually playful (e.g.,\\" I hope I grow up to be as perfect as you!\\") and it feels very realistic, but it becomes incredibly boring after listening to it for so long during this series. I had to skim some of it in order to finish The Crystal City. I listened to the audio version, so basically I sped up the narration to about triple the normal rate in parts, especially the dialogue. The Blackstone audio versions are very good, by the way, though I always had to speed them up. The narrator Stephen Hoye is particularly excellent in this series.It's not clear whether there will be any more books in the TALES OF ALVIN MAKER series. The ending is open and some readers will be disappointed that it doesn't tie up all the loose ends. I'm at the point that I don't care. Either way, I'm done with Alvin Maker."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Following the previous books on the Alvin Maker series, we see Alvin and companions reaching out to further his dream of the Crystal City. It seems nothing is easy.. and he still has to think and stretch his skills toward the dream he has had for a goodly portion of his life.. The race continues. He meets trouble and disappointment.. but soldiers on."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I really enjoyed this whole series. Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite writers today! I fell in love with his writing with the Ender sci-fi series, but I also enjoy reading his fantasy works, as well. He is able to pull me into his stories immediately. I don't want to put his books down, having to know what is going to happen to my favorite characters."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I think Orson could have done more to finish such an excellent series, the ending felt flat. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I loved the first 5 novels in this series. I looked forward to this book and was disappointed. If you read the first 5, like me, you are likely going to read this no matter what I say, but consider buying it used or borrowing it from a friend! Unlike the first 5 novels, it is predictable and there is little additional character development. I know Mr. Card has strong Mormon beliefs, but in the end when the Crystal City's tower is named a &quot;tabernacle&quot;, that was just a little too much for me. I don't know if I hope there is a 7th book or not."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"&quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; series by Orson Scott Card has been my husband's and my latest joint reading project. We recently finished Book 6 in the series, &quot;The Crystal City.&quot;The series is set in an alternative version of Colonial America, in which various political entities hold interests in the North American continent and which people of various descent are steeped in magic that is common to their race.Thus, European settlers have &quot;knacks&quot; of varying degree and ability. The indigenous people move in harmony with the &quot;Greensong&quot; that encompasses all life. And people of African descent utilize physical objects, like poppets, to work their magic.The hero of the series, Alvin Maker, was born the seventh son of a seventh son -- a combination that blessed him with a particularly powerful knack. Although he was apprenticed as a smith, his true profession is that of maker, and Alvin wields tremendous power over natural forces like stone and metal.As the story progresses through successive volumes, Alvin gathers like-minded people to him in an effort to build the Crystal City of a childhood vision. And he learns, as his ability matures, that a maker is part of what he makes.A visit to Orson Scott Card's Web site (www.hatrack.com) recently informed us that the story is projected to encompass a total of seven volumes, which means there's only one left. I have great respect for Mr. Card for having established a finite, concluding number for the volumes in his series, because having read other writers' ongoing epics, I know the temptation to use familiar characters or locale can be a powerful one.Of the several multi-volume epics we have read, the authors' success has been varying. One of the biggest pitfalls, we've noticed, is that sooner or later the need to rehash past events for continuing readers or bring new readers up to speed tends to bog down the narrative if not handled with care. In the case of the Alvin Maker series, however, there is just enough &quot;boilerplate&quot; to keep things moving, or to offer an insight into the hearts and minds of Mr. Card's characters. The story continues moving forward, with new insights and revelations awaiting the familiar cast.So here's looking forward, in excitement mixed with regret, to the release of &quot;Master Alvin.&quot; This is an excellent series, to be enjoyed while it lasts, and re-read fondly when it is over. And if &quot;The Crystal City&quot; is any indication of what is to come, Mr. Card is wrapping things up at the peak of his storytelling powers as channeled in &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I enjoyed this newest contribution as much or more than the previous works. It is a fabulous adventure, and I am awaiting the next installment very impatiently. It is not apparent as yet whether Mr. Card is actully going to produce the next installment, I hesitatingly admit, but I believe there is more to tell in this adventure. Here's hoping. At any rate, this book was a very good investment. Hope you enjoy it as much."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Card seems to be building towards some kind of crisis, but this volume just advances each character a bit, kind of slow overall, but a very enjoyable chapter in a wonderful saga, none-the-less."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This book was interesting because I liked the characters. Other than that, though, it felt really... incomplete. It seemed to skip (although referring to) a lot of things that'd happened since the last book in the series, and how the action fit in with everything that was going on in North America at the time just wasn't clear.OSC is usually better than this; one wonders if he's starting to slip. Personally, I doubt it, but then I'm not objective; I love the guy and suck up whatever he writes. :)"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"At the end of HEARTFIRE, the fifth book in the Alvin Maker series, I asked myself if the subsequent book(s) could possibly be worse. The answer is a definitive \\"YES\\".This book follows Alvin as he leads a group of runaway slaves to freedom and Calvin and Arthur Stuart on a foray into Mexico. The narrative is ham-handed and preachy, and the introduction of potentially interesting characters, like Abe Lincoln, is handled very badly. The main characters are not developed any further, and subplots and arcs which may have turned interesting are abruptly dropped or fade away.Alvin's brother Calvin was set up as the villain in the last couple of books, but this subplot is allowed to fizzle out and Calvin fades away into the background. A hero is only as good as the villain is bad, so this shows that Alvin is no hero at all. In fact, as in the last book, Alvin is downright annoying.Don't even get me started on the golden plow.... \\"THAT'S IT??!!\\" is the nicest thing I can say. If there is a seventh book in the series, I will not waste my time."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This book, the sixth in the Alvin Maker series, is just as entertaining as the first five. I enjoy Card's style of writing and like the fact that he creates a historical science fiction so well. In this story many of the characters of previous books are reintroduced and the author, at times, only gives vague information as to their history in the story, so I don't suggest that anyone read this if they haven't read the other five (but of course the others were great too so there's no reason to not want to read them). I do feel that this book has less of \\"something,\\" but I'm not sure what exactly it is. I do still advise people to read it, especially if they're wondering what will happen to all these folks in the next book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I disagree with some of the people who reviewed the other works in this series. They did what teachers do. They analyzed the books to the point at which they drained the pleasure from the reading. I think that the entire series needs to be read and considered as a single body of work.Crystal City is amazing fantasy. It continues a story that teaches a lot about slavery and prejudices in early America. Prejudices that continue today. The story also teaches a lot about native America lore, beliefs and practices.My ONLY complaint is that Orson Scott Card did not complete the series with this volume. He obviously left room for another volume.A good friend told me that these stories portray Mormon philosophy. While it is true I need to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer to see symbolism, I have NOT seen it in the series. Maybe I don't know enough about that religion!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This is an epic quest journey, somewhat akin to Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, but without the overwriting that makes Mr. King's books lethal weapons if dropped on your foot. This is a fantasy that takes place in an alternate America, one in which some people have \\"knacks\\", that is, the ability to do unusual things . Our hero through the six books of the quest so far is Alvin Maker, who can do a lot of things very well, but he's burdened with an overcautious conscience, that often propels him into trouble, and keeps him from using his \\"knacks\\" to extricate him from these troubles. I like the series because we meet historical characters in often quite different contexts from their historical reputations, and the geography of the country is greatly different from actuality. It's a tale worth telling, and a tale I enjoy very much reading!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"This book is about a man called Alvin Maker who is filled with magical abilities and trying to find out what to do with his life. It takes place in 'a magical America that might have been.' Along with his wife and friends he meets along the way, he strives to build 'The Crystal City,' or the city of Makers. The only problem is no one knows how, including himself.If you liked the rest of 'The Alvin Maker' series, you will enjoy this book as well, but if you haven't read the series, I advise you not to read this book just yet as you won't understand a lot of it. In my opinion it was an excellent book. The way Card changed America in the book is very interesting and the storyline is original and great. Overall, it was an incredible book."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Of all the books in the Alvin maker series, Crytal City is by far the worste. The reasons for this are two fold but in essence you get tired of Alvin's Whinney attitude throught out the entire book.He is almost afraid to do anything for fear of corupting someone with his powers.Their is almost no mention of the unmaker in the book. Hence Alvin has no real villian to pit himself against. As such the book becomes a moral dialogue about the wrongness of slavery, bigotry, and discrimination.As such the story gets bogged down in values. Values of an America that never was.Safe travels:David"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"Overall I gave the book a good rating and if you've read all the rest in the series until now then you should read this one too. There were good parts of this book, however, the end definitely left me feeling a little robbed and waiting for something more."},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I love all of these Orson Scott Card Books all of his books are a great read. thank you very much!"},{"Title":"The Crystal City","review":"I started reading this series a few years ago and got all the way to heartfire before it just completely lost me.That said.. i was in half price books the other day bored and saw this. I Thought eh.. sure... I started the series, lets finish it.It's worse than heartfire in my opinion, and I didn't even particularly enjoy heartfire. So Preachy. Maybe I didn't catch the preacher like talk in the first books because I was getting caught up in the story. There are certainly elements about it I enjoyed... but mostly, the hell is this? lolI read it, I finished what I started.

Nat is generally a good boy, but Salem is an alien land to him. He longs for the days when he was in China and with the help of Marty Finch, a boy whose life is hanging around the docks, makes plans to go back. However, Marty is only interested in himself and attempts to steal a diamond from Nat's aunts.When the boys steal away in the night to board a ship, Marty sneaks to the hiding place and takes what he thinks is the diamond. Nat discovers this and fights Marty, but the boy is too much bigger and older and Nat is easily defeated. He is tied up until Marty sails away on the ship. Nat is very contrite and goes back to his aunts and confesses. It turns out that there was no diamond and the story closes with Nat understanding that Salem is his home now and that it is a good place to live because his aunts do indeed love him.This is a nice story for young people, it shows them that home is where love is and that we should always appreciate what we have.

The stories of Tubman's life were a bit dry (not really a dramatic telling), and the historical fact segments inserted into each chapter lacked context. But the general sense of the scope of her work on the railroad, her personal commitment, and the additional things she did in her life were generally well communicated. Readers certainly come away with a greater appreciation for Tubman's contribution despite numerous personal challenges."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"This is a good book to read if you're interested in non-fiction books. This book was given to me and my book members in Mrs. Shea's class. We were doing Literature Circles and Mrs. Shea gave my group this book to do it on. It's a good book to read if you're bored, and you may even learn something. So maybe you could put it on you're summer reading list.I liked this book because the adventure and the daring rescues. I liked the first time she ran away because it showed courage and the determination to be free. Many slaves in history showed this, even though they didn't know where to go. After she reached North, she went back after sometime and rescued more and more slaves. The journeys were dangerous, but Harriet went on with determination to help the slaves be free. Now, I'll talk about what I disliked about the book.One thing I disliked about this book was that in every Chapter in the end, there's a passage that informs you on a person in the chapter. I find this very annoying and I skipped it after I read each chapter. I also disliked it when Harriet first tried to run away with her three brothers. Her brothers betrayed her and made her go back. Also, I don't like Mr. Tubman, a free Negro. He had said to Harriet that if she ran away, he would betray her. These are the parts I didn't like about the book."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"Harriet Tubman was a wonderful women and this book hits the highlights of her life.

You don't have to like history to read this book. You'll get hooked anyway."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"Wow, a book that is worth hundreds of awards. Harriet Tubman comes alive in this book. Born as a slave in Tidewater maryland, Hariet grows to become a young woman whose first resistsance of slavery starts when a plantation overseer tries to punish a slave for trying to escape. Hariet adquires a huge gash on her forehead from a brick the overseer threw at the slave. However it missed and hit Harriet. Harriet's nickname Minta becomes Harriet which fits the woman she has become. Harriet's dream for freedom never ceases as her first attempt to espace is proven useles with the denial of her brothers. Then her second attempt to escape with her husband proves successful but without here husband who feared the overseers and plantation owners. the underground railroad which served as a passageway for slaves stopping at certain houses(stations) for food and support; helped Harriet escape to the North in Philadelphia.Along the way she meets a man named Thomas Garret, a Quaker who helps God's poor, or the slaves. In Philadelphia she meets William Still who helps here get settled in the North. From this, Harriet returns to the plantation to lead other slaves to freedom. Though her main mission was to free her relatives, she frees other slaves who were about to be sold to chain gangs on other plantations. She rescued babies,men,women, and children. In the end she rescued a total of over 300 fugitive slves with the help of William Still, Thomas Garret,Gerrit Smith, along with the friendly families of the undergroung railroad. Through this accomplishment she became known as Moses. In 1861-1865 during the civil war, she contributed invaluable service as a scout, spy and nurse at a fugitive slave hospital. When the slaves were freed, in 1863, and the war was over, in 1865, Harriet turned her efforts to women's sufferage, giving speeches, and becoming involved in raising money for schools. Still, Harriet would send vegetabels to different houses for work and people invited her to come in and tell them stories of her life. She would tell them about the life on the Railroad, John Brown, and General Montgomery in the civil war who commanded the Black Regiment. Two books were published about her life written by Ms. bradford but told by Harriet Tubman. When she finished with her stories, Harriet would always say she never ran her train off the track and she never lost a passenger. Harriet died on March 10, 1913 in Auburn N.Y. Her tombstone is erected with her quote at the end of her stories. I appreciate this book greatly because it brought me even closer to my heritage. It taught me the true power of a person who didn't give up even though those around her doubted it. People talk about heroes and Harriet Tubman is definetly on that list of heroes and should be first. I deeply honor and respect Harriet Tubman along with the other slaves and leaders who fought for the advancement of African Americans. Freedom and happiness is a God-given right that no man can ever take away, this is God's Law not human law. I hope hat one day I can do great things for poeple like Harriet Tubman."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"I love civil war history and this book will become one of my favorite on the subject. I thought I knew about Harriet Tubman and what she did helping others escape slavery; I was wrong. I had no idea \\"who\\" she was and what she went through. I didn't know what drover her, what inspired her and what she sacrificed until I read this book.Once when Petry was talking about Harriet and another female character in another book she said, \\"These women were slaves. I hoped that I had made them come alive, turned them into real people. I tried to make history speak across the centuries in the voices of people--young, old, good, evil, beautiful, ugly.\\" Believe me she did just that. She makes Harriet come back alive and real again. It was as if I was walking the miles between underground safety houses, I felt the pain of the stone that hit her head and almost killed her, and I understood the stubborn need to not just be free but to go back again and again to help others over and over again.Harriet Tubman was a wonderful American woman that not only helped others to be free but shaped history. I especially loved the notes at the end of each chapter telling what was happening at the same time in history, It gives just a little bit more of information and shows how special Harriet was and how it was a miracle that she was never caught.The best part about this book is that it is very easy to read. I cant wait to get a hold of more books by Petry."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"The southern United States, in the 1800's was a land of the tobacco and cotton industry, and a land of slaves. Born in 1821, Harriet Tubman was born a slave in Maryland, and then she never thought that she would be the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad. Early as a child, Harriet, or Minta, as she was called, was often sold from person to person, after getting a blow to the head from her master, because she wouldn't help capture an escaped slave. In her later years, she escaped to the north and became a free person. Then, after she beomes free, she helps the slaves that she knows from her old home escape through the hidden passes thus becoming a conductor for the Underground Railroad. All was well until a new law is passed: The Fugitive Slave Law, a law in which any runaway slave in the free states can be brought back to their original masters. Because of this, Harriet Tubman starts to take her runaway passengers to St. Catherines, Canada, where all former slaves would be free from the Fugitive Slave Law. Soon, after taking large numbers of slaves to Canada, Harriet makes a huge decision to take her parents along with her on her next journey. After a hard, back-breaking journey, they finally make it to St. Catherines. However, after transporting close to 300 runaway slaves on the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman ended her journey and started a new one serving as a spy and a nurse. Before and after dying in 1913, Harriet Tubman was recognized as a great person and as a \\"Moses\\" to many of the escaped slaves that she rescued. Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad, by Ann Petry, is a great biography that has suspense, adventure, and tells a great and accurate version of Harriet Tubman and her life.Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad, is an excellent historical biography, full of suspense as to what will happen to the slaves. One good example of this is when Tubman is facing her master, ordering her to catch an escaped slave, and waiting to see what will happen should she not do so. Also, when Harriet tries to rescue her parents, Old Rit and Old Ben, you can't wait to find out what becomes of them. While stealing a horse and wagon to help her parents, Harriet comes face to face with the keeper of the horse stable. The reader will wonder what will happen next. Will she escape or will the keeper catch her?This book also had a great portion of adventure. When Harriet had started out on her journey, she wandered out into a land that she had never saw before. She never knew what lied beyond a few miles or so. She ventured out and was always on guard of being caught by the slave patrols. The hardest part of Tubman's journeys and escapes was convincing her parents to flee, but eventually they are convinced and Tubman takes them as far as Canada.Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad, by Ann Petry, does a good job in accurately describing and presenting the right dialogue for Harriet Tubman. Petry described Tubman as she is known from history, a short, muscular woman who had the strenght and heart to set her people free. Being called \\"Moses\\" for setting her people free from slavery, earned her name in history. The use of dialogue from the period also served in making the book more interesting.Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad, by Ann Petry, is a great biography to read for not only the history, but for the adventure, the suspense, and the satisfaction that one person can make a difference. I rate this book a total of five stars out of five.A. Chappell"},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad by Ann Petry is a wonderfully written book about the hardships of slavery. It walks you through her entire life from the time she was born to when she became an influential speaker during the Civil War after feeing many salves from slavery in the South. The book is full of adventure from when she would simply race the kids to the troth knowing that the first there would eat the most, to the first time she was sent out to be a slave for a family and how seeing the measles stuck in the traps hurt her. She was considered un-teachable by some and shown off like a well-trained animal with others. The author really knew how to capture a person's attention making the book more enjoyable to read. The way the author also mentioned how she was considered to be like \`Moses' also brought more meaning to the book, knowing that the connection between both their abilities to save people. Ann Petry had a great ability of getting the point across that Harriet Tubman's life was never an easy on and her ability to risk it all to save others was absolutely amazing. Even though the book was slow in the beginning as it walked you through her beginning years it soon picked up and became a real page turner, Ann has a great way with words making putting the book down near impossible."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"\\"Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad\\" is a fantastic little biography of Harriet Tubman. Tubman has always been one of my personal heroes and this book does her story justice.I would say this book can be easily enjoyed by 4th graders and up. It also could serve as a great starting point for adults that don't know much about slavery and the American Abolitionist movement. While telling the story of Tubman's life, Petry also includes at the end of nearly every chapter historical tidbits about the slavery and the Abolitionist movement at the national level.The discussion of her service in the Civil War as a scout in the coastal areas of South Carolina spurred me to do some further research. Her commanding officer in the raids was Colonel James M. Montgomery, the nutty commander in the movieGlorywith this memorable line: \\"You see sesesh has to be cleared away by the hand of God like the Jews of old. Now I will have to burn this town.\\" Interestingly, Montgomery also served with John Brown in Kansas. Harriet Tubman also knew John Brown although she was not comfortable with his violent ways."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"Harriet Tubman was a fascinating book. I personally like to read history novels and books about people's lives, but this is more than a history book. This book tells all about the horrifying life she had as a child; secretly learning how to read then seeing her mother get beaten for it. This is one of the most interesting books I have read so far about slaves and freeing them. What Harriet Tubman did for the huge amount of slaves was amazing and not reccognized enough until now. Harriet Tubman is a savior not only for the 300 black slaves but also for letting white people know what it was like during the time when there were slaves. Anyone who likes exciting books should really read this."},{"Title":"Harriet Tubman, conductor on the Underground Railroad","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Harriet Tubman is a great woman. The author of this book, Ann Lane Petry, is a wonderful writer. The life of Harriet was hard. She grew up as a slave who craved freedom. She decided that everyone should be free. Her goal was to help everyone to freedom and she acheved her goal. She has given lots of people freedom. She was the conductor of the underground railroad that was not really underground at all. This book is among the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"I read an advance copy of this book of memoirs, and I finishedit in all of two days. Wiesel's life, his philosophy, his stories areenough to inspire us all. He adds a human perspective, a moral dimension, and at time a behind-the-scenes glance into the world of international politics. However unlike self-serving politicians his voice pleads for the preservation of memory, and acts as an advocate for victims everywhere. A truly enthralling must read."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"This magnificent voice of history continues in the newest volume of his autobiography to offer readers a unique closeup view of a life of literary and moral achievement, and of never ending hope even in the face of tragedy. Wiesel is an inspiration to readers everywhere."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"Easily one of the best autobiographies of the last half of the century (when coupled with Volume One). It is almost hard to believe that a man with such vision, such drive, such intelligence could have written almost an understated autobiography which reads as easily as any novel on your summer reading list.I strongly reccomend that anyone who wants to learn and be inspired by one man's drive to remember and honor (amd ensure that no one else forgets), read both volumes of this elegant autobiography."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"Elie Weisel in my eyes is a great man. He is the witness of the most horrible evil in human history , who somehow managed to help make the character of that Evil known to the world. He is a devoted writer and a foremost spokesman and defender of the Jewish people. But he is also has a special role in working to help the suffering and the persecuted throughout the world. Years ago in Biafra he was there to try and help the Ibo. And since then he has time and again placed himself at risk to help others. As a teacher and writer his work bears not only the mark of his poetic and G-d haunted soul, but of his enormous devotion to the good of humanity. This volume picks up the story of his life when at forty he decides to make a more determined effort to help the suffering of humanity. It tells the story of journeys and struggles .Often he is met by opposition but he is fueled by the determination to stand for the suffering. As a truthteller he dared confront the President of the United States over the obscenity of Bitburg . His deeds go before him and his words are a light to mankind. May G-d bless him and his work for the future."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"I loved the first biography by Elie Wiesel, All Rivers Run to the Sea. I loved his objectivity, his detached but sharp view on the incredible and often cruel incidents that happened in his life, as well as his reserved but firm believe and philosophy you can see behind it. I was fascinated by the personal story of this incredible person and was impressed by the power of his quiet words that was much powerful than too emotional accounts on the tragedy that we often hear.However this book, And the Sea is Never Full, is very different from the previous volume. It is much more emotional and more centred around his phiolosophy on his religion. I am giving only 3 stars, not because it's not good - people who are interested in Wiesel's religious believe and stands most likely will find it interesting - but because I expected more stories on his life (and philosophy behind it) not believe itself, and found this book a bit too personal, as if written for himself rather than for readers."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"After ten years of silence about his experiences in the hell of the Nazi reign, Elie Wiesel has unleashed a literary and humanitarian career, utilizing his pen and memories as means to spread peace and stop hate and violence. And the Sea is Never Full, the memoirs of Elie Wiesel from the year 1969, is more than the attempt of a Holocaust survivor to come to terms with the world that betrayed him; it contains lessons learned by one who has seen the worst of humanity and who still finds the avenue for having faith in people. That avenue, for Elie Wiesel, is God.Born to devout Jewish parents on September 30th, 1928 in Sighet, Hungary, Elie Wiesel spent his childhood absorbed in literature and the study of Hasidic Judaism by request of his father, Shlomo Wiesel, who encouraged Elie to take upon the knowledge of Judaic history and culture. He lived his life very peacefully in Sighet, a town with an enormous population of Jews, with his parents and his three sisters. This happiness was viciously torn away from Elie when the Nazis invaded Hungary in 1944 and the Wiesel family was sent to the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. This time marks the beginning of the observations and influences that would lead Elie to devote his life to human rights and nonviolence work, as he narrates in And the Sea is Never Full. 10 years pass. These memoirs are an addition to the endless list of literary works that Elie Wiesel began after writing Night in 1958, his first narrative about his experiences in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, the vision of his father's torture to death, and the deaths of his mother Sara and sister Tsipora. Taking on an extensive amount of literary writings and responsibilities, Elie Wiesel's writing and political activism for the African apartheid, Israeli, and other conflicts earns him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for the influence of his pressure for peace.The memoirs have one clear focus, and that is on the power of hate, indifference, and religion. And the Sea is Never Full relates the actions and thoughts of Elie Wiesel molded by his Holocaust experience, though it is filled with Judaic parables dispersed throughout the text as Elie Wiesel encounters new people, each one portrayed in a very raw and human light, each one a child of God. Elie Wiesel presents himself, more than anything, as a Jew and unyielding worshiper of God. He lives his life by the ideals that his Jewish childhood taught him: \\"It is because it is difficult if not impossible to sing, to pray, to hope that we must trip. [...] Let one person, just one, extend his hand to a beggar, a fugitive, a refugee, and life will be become meaningful for others\\" (Wiesel 29).His words constantly spell out his own reflections on the events that occur in his life after 1969; And the Sea is Never Full is more a diary, a journal into the mind of a man struggling to do everything in his power to prevent the repetition of the Holocaust. Wiesel is a master traveler in his text, darting from country to country, city to city to participate in committees for Holocaust remembrance events, UNESCO planning, and to teach at City College in New York and at Boston University. We meet and lose Bea, one of Wiesel's sisters who survived the Holocaust; we meet Gorbachev, Francois Mitterrand, Hiroshima survivors, and officials of the KGB. We visit Israel and become completely involved in the strategy and hardships of securing an Israeli state, while learning about Wiesel's observations and involvement in the world events of the time. No unpleasant descriptions or life characterizations are spared. The writing is opinionated and passionate. The story is true.While And the Sea is Never Full achieves its goal for being the personal statement of a Holocaust survivor, a global activist, and a writer, it leaves the reader confused as to what Wiesel's thoughts are concerning violence. He does not leave any room for doubt on his beliefs for peace and the importance on avoiding human indifference, but he contradicts himself with his pride in the Israeli army and its military strategy. It leaves us wondering what he respects more, an ideal or a country. What does he believe is the solution to the hate and conflict in the world? As a leader, educator, and activist, his memoirs would do well to present more of his opinion on the state of the world.And the Sea is Never Full is a captivating account of a man who saw much of the world and created a change in every place he visited. It leaves the reader wanting to learn more about Elie Wiesel's past and the little events and images that led to his activism and writing. Night is a common educational tool, but rarely is Elie Wiesel as commonly discussed as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Gandhi. And the Sea is Never Full presents his thoughts loud and clear, pushing for more knowledge and understanding into the influences of human evil and human forgiveness."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"I do appreciate an author with a point of view about things and if nothing else Wiesel has that. His autobiography tells the story of a man with a mission, a passion, and strong convictions."},{"Title":"And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-","review":"Elie Wiesel's And The Sea Is Never Full provides the concluding volume of memoirs, relating his meetings with world leaders, his travels, and his diplomatic adventures. Familiarity with Wiesel's importance and his prior memoirs will lend a special appreciation for this concluding volume."},{"Title":"Selling Out","review":"People recently have been lamenting the low voter turnout and general apathy of the american voter. I think Green is dead on when he suggests campaign financing is a big culprit. Politicians accept monetary donations from corporations and PACs that grossly shadow donations from individuals, leaving us feeling that our say or vote doesn't make a difference, and that all candidates are lousy; it's just a matter of which is more tolerable.Green lays it out in this well researched book. If you have any faith in the US government, it will be gone after reading this book. The &quot;good guys&quot; are few and far between - and it's more and more difficult for them to get elected to office to make a difference."},{"Title":"Selling Out","review":"Mark Green has spent his entire adult life in consumer interest reform politics. He began by working for Ralph Nader and eventually became New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs. He became more intimately connected than ever to the dangers posed to democracy by the influence of big money when he ran as the Democratic Party's candidate in the last New York mayoral election against multimillionaire Michael Bloomberg. The amount of money spent on both sides was staggering, prompting Green to pick up his talented pen and write this tome dedicated to awakening citizens to the dangers of a democracy perilously close to drowning in a cesspool of excessive funds.Whereas America's founding fathers provided the nation's fledgling government with a system of checks and balances, in current times one can forget about the balances and concentrate fully on the checks. Checks and more checks are forthcoming from big interests, which translates into ultimate control, no matter how often this axiomatic truth is denied. As critics ask: If the strategy is not succeeding, why do the big money interests shower accelerating amounts on political campaigns?The cancer on our democracy is abundantly clear to those interested citizens watching election battles in the current 2002 mid-term campaign. Rather than stepping forward and debating the merits of the major issues facing the nation, an increasingly helpless and turned off citizenry is bombarded by simplistic campaign negative ads highlighting half truths and sometimes outright lies. Post election studies reveal that excessive negative advertising disgusts many voters, who then become so turned off by the process that they do not vote at all. This was symbolized in the 1988 presidential election when George Bush the Elder prevailed on a highly orchestrated campaign of negative advertising highlighted by Willie Horton and the Pledge of Allegiance. Less than half of all eligible voters bothered to go to the polls, an all-time high since such scientific studies began to measure voting tendencies.This cancer on the body politic has been a festering wound for some time. A few years ago in California an election campaign specialist with an imposing track record for success proclaimed bluntly that when a candidate hired his services it was time for him or her to take a vacation. He did not want the candidate to get in the way as he put his big money campaign into gear, highlighted by advertising displays of catchy symbols and pithy comments, which were drummed ad nauseum into the minds of voters through television and radio.Mark Green made a recent appearance on the Phil Donahue Show in which he made a dire prediction. If this cancer is not dissipated through corrective legislation very soon then we will reach the point where the only two types of candidates are independently wealthy moguls ready, willing and able to spend millions of their own dollars such as a Michael Bloomberg, or lackeys under the total control of the wealthy special interests bankrolling their campaign efforts.Mark Green's is an important voice which needs to be heard. The voice is tuned into the major area that will make or break democracy as we have known it. Will the days of idealistic but far from wealthy candidates be truly a thing of the past? Will Jeffersonian town hall democracy be something the smooth talking kingmakers will dismiss with sarcastic laughter as relics from a truly distant past?"},{"Title":"Selling Out","review":"I've chosen this book, together with Michael Moore's \\"Stupid White Men\\" and Greg Palast's \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\" to end a lecture I give on the top 50 books every American should read in order to understand why America is not safe today and will not become safe anytime soon, unless the people take back the power and restore common sense to how we spend the $500 billion a year that is now *mis-spent* on the military-industrial complex instead of real capabilities for a real world threat.Mark Green knows as much as anyone could know about the intricate ways in which the existing system provides for *legally* buying elected representatives away from the citizens' best interests. The details he provides in this book--as well as the moderate success stories where reforms have worked--are necessary.The bottom line is clear: until the 60% of America that is eligible to vote but does not vote, comes back into the democracy as active participants who question candidates, vote for candidates, and hold elected representatives accountable *in detail and day to day,* then corporate corruption will continue to rule the roost and will continue to concentrate wealth in the hands of an unreasonably wealthy few at the expense of the general public.Although I found the book inspiring, I also found it depressing. Absent another 9-11 (or two--or suicidal shooters in an elementary school in every state of the union, or cataclysmic failure in Iraq and North Korea) I see no immediate prospects for America's dropped-out citizens \\"awakening\\" and taking back the power.

Ken Lay was a large contributor to G.W. Bush in elections as Texas Governor and President. These contributions opened the door for Lay's participation on Cheney's energy task force. The author also traces the connection between Bush and Ken Lay evident in the crossover between Enron and presidential appointments.Along those same lines, Mr. Green cites California's experiences as an example of why energy deregulation was ill-advised. Monopolistic prices resulted.In a quote from page 181 the author describes some of the benefits reaped by corporate contributions. \\"The return on it's investment that the energy industry was seeking in the mid-1990's was deregulation.\\"The battles over campaign finance reform and various court decisions were highlighted. Soft money often becomes addictive for incumbents. It provides a built-in advantage that challengers normally can't overcome.The Gramm-St.Germain bank deregulation bill was mentioned. That's more than relevant for today with the Wall Street bailout!Mr. Green details how lobbyists for big oil, energy, and pharmaceutical companies pay for beneficial legislation.While the author spends a lot of time on what is wrong with our government, he does offer some promising ideas that states are pursuing. One state is Rhode Island where free airtime has been mandated on public television and community cable for all candidates that participate in the public funding program. Britain has some interesting ideas also. In 2001 the British gave free airtime on public and commercial television for political parties. They also banned political commercials.On the subject of free airtime he has this quote from Warren Buffett- \\"We should require broadcast stations- the benficiaries of incredibly valuable licenses, courtesy of your federal governement- to make available, prior to every election, modest amounts of time for political discourse. Let's add an ability to be heard to a right to speak.\\"\\"Selling Out\\" is an eye-opening book about what's wrong with national politics and to some extent, state and local politics as well.

The first chapter is, perhaps, the weakest which is a pity as it may put one or two people off. But after that it hits its stride and takes you on a world tour full of sharp observation and wit. Oh yes, and a bit of fishing is thrown in too.It's really three books in one: the first bit is pretty much memorabilia - the stuff we all have from our childhood and from the familiar; then there are some great stories about specific trips and countries that almost take you right there onto the beach or the boat. Finally there are some alternatives to fishing and the whole work finishes in a hard hitting piece about the threats to the sport and a reality check for the anti-fishing lobby.McSherry's touch is light and ironic at all times with just a touch of the polemic about it. It makes you smile and think in equal measure.A very good book from a first time author and worth a read whether you fish for trout, salmon, sailfish or marlin...or even if you don't fish at all."},{"Title":"Experienced Cognition","review":"Carlson is a cognitive psychologist that seems just woke up one day, and said &quot;hey, why not wtite a book on consicousness?&quot;. The thing is he did a very good job. His cognitive theory of consicousness, conscious cognition, is quite ambitious. It uses the ecological approach to cognitive science by Gibson, the philosophy of intentioality, and the information processing approach to generate a theory, and then it applies it to many classical cognitvive domains, like working memory, perception, emotion, although it concentrates on goals and skills.The book is technical at times, and seemed hard to read, although this is probably due to the fact that I know next to nothing of the cognitive psychology oof goal and skill aquisition, the issue carlson concentrates on. On the start, Carlson warns us he will not go into the congitive neuroscience of his model, and this is disapointing and unfortunate, as we will see. The philosophy in the book is also a little weak. The analisis on intentional structures, representations, and contents, all essential for Carlsons model, are modeled mostly after Searle's work. But Searle is by no means the only philosopher of intentionality or representationalism, and his work is neither fashionable nor undisputedly accepted as definitive. Carlosn therefore cannot and does not adress deep philosophical problems or possible objections to his analisis. Gibsons ecological theory, in contrast, has been gaining more and more support over the years, and along with embodied cognition, is quite fashionable among cognitive scientists nowdays. There's also Carlsons questionable theorethical commitments, like his seeming denial of the classicaly conceived congitive unconscious, his denial of consicousness as providing global access, his ambiguous position on the symbol-processing-sufficient-for consciousness debate, etc..But even considering these comments, Carlsons cornerstone for his theory of consciousness, the cospecification hypothesis, has in my view much potential for advancing the cognitive understanding of consicousness. Consciousness in this hypothesis is roughly :an informational array that cospecifies the self and the object, that is being constantly resampled and explored, so as to distinguish the object and self-specific information, where this last process of egolocation serves to guide cognitive activity. This seems quite abstract, but in the book quite well explained by Carlson. With this hypothesis in place, Carlson sets out to show how consicousness might fit into cognitive theory. And he succeds, as long as one considers his theory as only coherent. Wether one agrees with the hypothesis, and with his intentionality analisis, is another thing. That is, why would cospecifiyng the slef and the object in an informational array make a system conscious? One can easily envision a computer that has a monitoring system and a sensor, a place where that information is put together and then a second order monitor that resamples that information to guide response, without it ever being consicous of anything (yes this is an old philosophical trick in consicousnesss studies). But when one has to thought experiment like this, one knows it is a desperate objection. Thus, Carlsons theory is very interestingly plausible.As an interesting observation, if only Carlson would have speculated on the neurobiological interpretation of his cospecification hypothesis, he might have anticipated completely Antonio Damasios theory of consciousness. In Damasios theory consicousness is considered as the interplay between the organism (self), the object and their relationship. Consicousness is knowledge that the organism is involved in relating to an object (exploration, resampling), and that the object is causing change in the organism (egolocation) . So the brain maps the organism (self-information) the object (object-information) and their relationship, then forms meomories of obejts and finally holds active simultaniously all this information (cospecification in an informational array). In the chapter on emotion, Carlson quote Damasio a lot, and proposes that homeostatic and proprioceptive information might serve as the self-part information in egolocative processing, a very similar claim to Damasions creation of the proto-self and its role in consicousness. Damasio, on his book on consicousness, does not quote or cite as reference Carlsons work.This book is innovative because while AI researchers, Physicists, philosophers and neuroscientists probe consciousness in popular books, cognitive psychologists stay in the laboratory and their journals. This is a very interesting and ambitious approach, but it is the kind needed to make genuine advances in the field.

It showed an extensive history and the colorized Sundays since its debut. In this book, it has only 8 pages of history. I must add it was quite informative. The annual collections are, with a doubt, great! It allows me to read the comics I missed since my newspaper isn't able to carry them (another paper has exclusive rights). All in all, I love Pat Brady's work. I love the way he draws the characters in different perspectives and of course the humor! It kind of puts a warm feeling in your heart I also like the glossy cover.

Of course, this means that the book is excellent. Pat Brady continues to show us how the simple things in life can be humorous and cute as well as how to get pleasure from the simplest things in life such as how to deal with cramped kitchen space or the coming of spring. Dissapointing however, is that with a title such as &quot;15th Anniversary Collection&quot; I was hoping to catch a greater glipse of Rose is Rose's history. Of the 128 pages of comics, I recognized a great deal of them from syndication within the past year as well as a few from previous compilation books. I know many fans, myself included, who have only discovered the world of Rose within the past year or two and yearn to see how the comic used to be. While I treasured the eight pages devoted to some of the more &quot;historical&quot; moments of Rose's past, it failed to sate my curiousity regarding the evoultion of Rose is Rose. While the book stands strong on its own merits as is, I would have much preferred about 50 pages of history as opposed to a paltry eight.

The result, in this case at least, is a complete train wreck.I'm a professional poker player, a recent college grad, and the owner of about 50 poker books. I was excited but wary when I found this title recently; I've always thought there was a gap in the poker literature on this topic, approaching the game from a more rigorously analytical perspective. Many have tried, but just about all have failed miserably, and this is no exception.The author, Mahmood N Mahmood, is originally Iraqi, and his incomprehensible writing makes it obvious that he is not a native English speaker. The book is filled with poor grammar, misused words, and awkward, unclear phrasing (at one point he calls a player's hand his 'attainment'). The back cover claims that he retired early in 1992 and became a semi-professional player, but I highly doubt that.On the first page of the introduction, Mahmood reveals that most of his data comes from popular poker simulation software, and the rest from other poker books. I expected something original. The first title he credits as a source for statistics in this book is \\"'Super Systems' by Doyle Brunson\\". The book is 'Super System,' commonly referred to in poker circles as 'the Bible.' Tip: If you're going to try to pretend you know what you're talking about and write a book about poker, don't butcher this name. The second book he cites is \\"'Formula Won' by Michael J Barry\\". I spent some time looking but could not find any mention of this book anywhere. It does not appear to exist.He ambitiously attempts to cover hold'em, omaha, and stud, each in pot-limit and limit forms. Apparently, Mahmood does not realize that pot-limit stud is almost never played, and no-limit hold'em is much more popular than pot-limit.He refers to Omaha hands such as \\"A-K-J-T(s)\\" and \\"A-J-T-9(o)\\". It's common convention to describe hold'em hands as \\"A-Ks\\" or \\"T-9o\\" for suited and offsuit cards, respectively. This convention makes no sense for the four card Omaha hands.On strategy, he states that A-K-J-T plays best against three opponents, and that A-J-T-9 is better and wants a lot of opponents. He doesn't explain why, although it's fairly obvious that he's basing it off showdown simulation results, which are meaningless for this purpose.For hold'em, a good example of the terrible advice in this book is a discussion of \\"Q-7(s)\\", queen-seven suited. He is assuming you are in late position and that a player you somehow know has A-Ks has raised in front of you. He reasons that the hand becomes profitable and should be played if you can get at least four opponents, because it will win 21% of the time against AKs and three other random hands. This might apply if there was no more betting after the flop and the cards were just turned up, but that's not how poker is played. He also assumes that the other three players have average, random hands even though they've called a strong raise - totally unreasonable.All of his strategies are based solely on the concept of pot odds - memorizing percentages, and comparing the size of the pot to the percentage chance of your hand winning. If it were that simple, poker would have died off from lack of interest long ago.I just had an epiphany after writing that last paragraph. When I was first starting out in poker, I heard more experienced players calling Q-7 the \\"computer hand.\\" When I asked why, they explained that there was an old book claiming the hand was profitable based on computer simulation results, when even relatively new players know that's not true - hence the mocking nickname. This must be that book. The original publishing date is 1988, apparently reprinted in 2003.For excellent coverage of the general principles behind strong poker play, see \\"The Theory of Poker,\\" by David Sklansky."},{"Title":"Science Of Poker","review":"This book is somewhat difficult to read, and adds nothing to what the better poker books teach.

The kind verdict is that it is hard to understand; the unkind verdict is that it is hopelessly and seriously wrong (in places).I turned eagerly to the section on Hold'em. At the start of ch8 \\"Starting Hands\\", it says that \\"the return on investments of all the high pairs (TT or better) does not improve when more than 4 opponents are contesting the pot. High pairs, therefore, should be played against not more than 4 contestants.\\" What on earth does he mean? You should fold AA just because 5 other guys reach the flop? Reading on does not do much to clarify. I think he means that with AA you should keep raising before the flop. But it is certainly hard to understand, particularly when two pages further on he explains that \\"Small pairs play best against more than 5 opponents\\".I have a maths degree, so I can easily cope with odds calculations, but some of his are at best obscurely presented and sometimes seem wrong."},{"Title":"Science Of Poker","review":"A good read for any poker player.Even if you think you \\"know it all\\",you WILL learn something from this book."},{"Title":"Country Home Plans","review":"I have been looking for an old &quot;Country House Plans&quot; magazine I belive that the Title was &quot;Sweet Dream House&quot;, and I know it was the fall of '97' issue. could someone help me.Stevesut@Juno.com"},{"Title":"Old Lucy Lindy, (A Young owl book)","review":"This book is very entertaining for children.

In the excellent biographical introduction by Claire Huchet Bishop she tells how Isaac who was a quite assimilated French Jew was moved by the coming to power of the Nazis to begin his fundamental research into the origins of Christian Anti-Semitism.In the work itself Isaac considers three teachings which have been particularly damaging. The first is the teaching that the dispersion of the Jews is 'providential punishment' for the Crucifixion. The second is the teaching that Judaism was in a 'degenerate' state at the time of Jesus. The third is the alleged crime of the deicide. He claims that this latter idea has been the most devastating of all in regard to Christian treatment of Jewish minorities. He refutes these ideas by examining carefully both the history of the Jews, and the documents themselves. In this he maintains also that the Gospels are works of 'religious teaching and persuasion and are not concerned with historical accuracy'.Isaac's work was to have influence on another great historian of Christian anti- Semitism, the British James Parkes. Isaac also through his meeting with John Paul 23 was to have great influence on the changing of Church doctrine in relation to the Jews."},{"Title":"The Teaching of Contempt: Christian Roots of Anti-Semitism","review":"THE TEACHING OF CONTEMPTI rated this book highly because it provided valuable information & insights into the relationship between Christianity and Judaism spanning the last two millennia"},{"Title":"The Teaching of Contempt: Christian Roots of Anti-Semitism","review":"This is a distillation of Jules Isaac's \\"Jesus and Israel.\\" He begins with two contradictory considerations: A true Christian can't be an anti-Semite, and anti-Semitism is profoundly rooted in Christianity.To demonstrate his points, Isaac investigates three major Christian themes: 1) That the Jews were banished from Palestine as punishment for killing Jesus; 2) That Judaism was degenerate at the time of Jesus; 3) That Jews are guilty of the crime of deicide. Using logic and countless examples, Isaac disassembles each accusation by explaining its genesis, its propagation and its falseness."},{"Title":"Buffy contre les vampires, tome 4 : Rptition mortelle (French Edition)","review":"The thing that made &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; such a great television shows is that it was able to combine action, comedy and drama in such a seemless manner. Once you get past the idea that all that martial arts stuff was needed to drive a steak through the heart of a vamp, the action routines were the best on television. The comedy was character driven to such an extent that a priceless funny moment could be a double-take or a raised eyebrow as much as a quick quip or arcane pop-culture reference. But the heart of the series was the dramatic undertones, always implicit in the fact that Slayers die young and reaching its operatic heights with Buffy's tragic relationship with Angel.All of the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; books, whether original stories or adapted from various episodes, automatically lose the action elements. Break down the fight sequence from the second part of &quot;Becoming&quot; and it is going to lose something on the printed page. So losing one part of the Buffy triad is an automatic given. The problem with &quot;Night of the Living Rerun&quot; is that the story overloads the comedy and comes up way short of the drama. Arthur Byron Cover is not alone in this regard as this my standard complaint with the vast majority of early &quot;BtVS&quot; novels.Forget about the cute title, the heart of this story is a compelling tale: the story of Samantha Kane, the Slayer during the title of the Salem Witch Trials. How does this fit into the Buffy mythos? This happened to be when the Master was accidentally trapped in the other dimension. Buffy keeps dreaming about the past, and when the same thing starts happening to Giles and Xander the set up is for a symbolic replay of the past.I suppose it was too early to have tales of the earlier Slayers without including Buffy and the gang when Cover &quot;Night of the Living Rerun,&quot; but I think this particular story idea would have worked better either as a bookend to the final demise of the Master or as some sort of parallel story. Adding these extra layers took away from a fascinating story idea. Eventually, after Season Four, we did learn more about the First Slayer and Buffy's predecessors, and we had the &quot;Tales of the Slayer&quot; collection of short stories, so we did get to the point where the Slayer mythos could sustain its own fiction without the characters from the series. What Cover wrote here was the first look at a past that has been revealed in much more detail over the years since this early &quot;BtVS&quot; novel was written."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jefferey Smith's Seeds of Deception is a 'must read' for anyone who eats.

The author does an outstanding job in researching and documenting the stunning amount of explicit deceit on the part of the regulators, GM companies and many scientists that are involved in GM research.The way that the GM companies like Monsanto unashamedly persecute and bully those who raise safely concerns is extremely disturbing considering the potential dangers that the product poses. What is even more worrying is the distinct lack of research into the effects on humans, and what worries me even more than this is when research is done showing the harm that GM products cause, GM companies flagrantly throw their weight around to either stop the paper being published or blatantly fabricate or distort evidence to discredit the paper, even when they know that their product is unsafe. Now I'm sure that this happens in aspects of all industries, but this is entirely unacceptable with a food product, especially one as radical as GM foods.There are so many severe risks associated with GM foods that it makes me wonder if there could ever be a situation which would warrant the gamble of using GM foods.The main concern that I have about this book is it's age, although it is only six years old, six years in science years is a long time, much of the information that is presented in this book could well be obsolete by now.The author explains the complex world of biology and genetics in very easy to understand English, he gives the reader a firsthand understanding of how GM is done and the problems that manifest themselves at the fundamental gene level.I would really be hard-pressed to give this book anything less than five stars.

It is important for anyone who eats food to read! It is well written and keeps one's interest all the way thru. How could it not!Learn about how our dairy farmers are injecting their cows with rBGH, a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone to increase milk production. It also gives them boob infections called mastitis. So the farmers give them shots of anitbiotics, various kinds depending on the farmer, or availability. rBGH is called \\"cow crack\\" because it speeds them up. It makes them miserable and it is all to increase milk production so that farmers get more milk subsidies from the government, not because we need more milk. And does pasteurization get rid of the rBGH? No. Are we drinking it? Yes. Are we also drinking the antibiotics? Yes. Should we be drinking organic milk? Yes. Personally I have been buying organic milk only, for over four years, and it tastes better than 'ordinary' milk. Every carton is delicious, unlike regular milk which half the time I dump down the sink because it tastes terrible.Back to the book: \\"Contrary to the assurances of the biotech companies that genetic engineering is precise and simply extends traditional breeding techniques, it is actually quite different. When genetic crops are engineered, the gene is inserted randomly, out of a sequence that has evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Although engineers assumed that each gene creates a single protein, the very recent discovery that human beings have only some 30,000 genes...shows that this premise was wrong. (until a few yrs ago it was believed that humans had approx 100,000 genes).\\"Further, genes interact; one gene may trigger other unpredicted and undesired effects.\\"....\\"The random position and lack of control of the gene's functions could change any character of the plant and might not be evident immediately.\\" \\"for example , unexpected deformities in GM soy, and cotton crops.\\" ....the accidental switching on of a host organism's gene at random...... horizontal gene transfer, where genes can jump between organisms with unpredictable consequences.G.M. DNA does in fact transfer to bacteria in the human gut - previously thought impossible.\\"... genetically modified organisms are not rigorously tested. They are not as nutritious as our old fashioned food. (In my opinion they don't taste very good either). Baby food, allergies, ...might affect sexual development in children and bowell obstruction...... food derived illnesses are doubled (cdc) in the past 7 yrs..... rise in allergies - 50% increase in soy allergies.Researchers doctor their studies to avoid finding problems with GM foods. (they could lose their research grants and/or their jobs). example: re rBGH study, cows that got sick were dropped from rBGH studies while cows that were pregnant before treatment were counted as support that the drug didn't interfere with fertility.....Conflicts of interest gallore. Suppression and vilification of scientists who try to convey research info to the public that is deemed to harm the industry. FDA corruption. \\"Former FDA Commissioner ' The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it's doing are as different as night and day.\\"Biotech industry folks working in high positions in the U.S. government. \\"Muscling the Media; threats to sue keep absolutely everyone quiet except for a brave few (like this author). Do we ever hear discussions about gm foods on television? NO. ...do animals enjoy eating gm food? No. Is the government relying on the biotech companies to test their own products? Yes. Are they actually testing their products? No.The White House, no matter the President , has always supported the biotech industry \\"at the expense of human health\\". Campaign contributions, bribery, billions of lobby dollars, threats, corruption, beyond belief. And not only in the U.S.. In Canada, Dr. Margaret Haydon tried to refuse to approve rBGH \\"due to her concerns for human health. She was taken off the case.\\"\\"Genetic engineering presents probably the largest ethical problem that science has ever had to face.\\" \\"Going ahead in this direction may be not only unwise, but dangerous. Potentially, it could breed new animal and plant diseases, new sources of cancer, novel epidemics.\\"And of course the growers of gm crops must use specific insecticides (Roundup) manufactured by the same biotech companies that made the seeds.

For $10 I expected better editing. There are numerous typos which in some cases loose the meaning of whole paragraphs. Also, this book desperately needs a new edition. The most recent information is from 2003 and most of the sitings in Seeds of Deception are from the 1990s.The sitings from the 1980s and 1990s make an excellent historic record showing the pervasive fraud and negligence in scientific studies submitted by Biotech firms such as Monsanto to the FDA ... but it is now 2012 and I would like more current information along with the historical.The book is worth buying, however, as a single cohesive publication on the Food Safety issues of genetically modified foods and food additives. It also contains practical appendixes at the end to help customers identify GM products and links to the author's website and a non GMO buying guide. Very helpful. As a health-conscious consumer I had the notion that I didn't care to purchase GMO foods but had no concrete knowledge which foods were GMO or how to avoid them. I will make some changes to my shopping & eating habits after reading this book! The real eye-opener for me was that much rennet and enzymes used in USA cheese processing are now GM. I had no idea.Seeds of Deception also refutes in a logical way the BioTech industry claims that GM food will solve world hunger - it won't. I always suspect PR gimmicks when giant corps claim altruistic goals - if they care that much why don't they just donate a percentage of profits to charity?Seeds of Deceptions deconstructs the marketing schemes which play on people's sympathy to sell unsafe products.So while I encourage buying this book to educate ourselves on food safety, it is a pretty shoddy product for the cost.

(Smith is not a scientist)Seeds of Deception exposes the \\"dirty deals\\" between industry and government as well as the science of genetic modification. While I find some of the \\"dirty deal\\" aspects believable and concerning (as well as well written),I found the \\"science\\" aspects unbelievable and poorly written.The first chapter is devoted to Arpad Pusztai, whom Smith wants you to believe is a scientist who proved that GMOs are dangerous, but was fired in order to shut him up. (Because there is a giant global conspiracy) In reality, Pusztai's work is severely flawed by the lack of controls, extremely small sample size (6 rats per group) and unsupported conclusions. Pusztai claims that not only the particular GM plant he studied could be dangerous, but the very process of genetic engineering causes toxic food and can give you cancer!The cancer connection comes from Pusztai's study of cell proliferation in the rat intestines. He measured this because it is an indication of the quality of nutrition in the diet of GM-fed rats. His conclusion was that it had \\"both proliferative and antiproliferative effects\\". In reality, the numbers he got were simply variable, with no statistical correlation. In order to pull a conclusion from his data, he made what I call a \\"Bizzaro-World Model\\" and said that the same molecule did the exact opposite thing depending on the location of the gut. OK. This would be like taking aspirin and it giving you less pain in your right brain and more pain in your left. Also, the whole point of looking at cell proliferation was to have an indirect measure of nutrition. But Pusztai apparently feels the need to come up with a new explanation for cell proliferation by saying that the GMOs are causing cancer!Pusztai was fired because he went on TV and made statements unsupported by evidence, caused near-hysteria, and did bad science. He is not a whistle-blower. His work is not controversial; no scientist can defend it...But a Non-Scientist can, especially if he doesn't include any data and doesn't care about scientific principles such as controls and statistics.Based off the Pusztai conclusions, Smtih proposes what I call an \\"Anything Can Happen Model\\" of GMOs. This is based on alternative splicing, or the way one gene can code for multiple proteins. Smith gets this absolutely wrong by saying that an mRNA can be re-arranged so that it codes for whichever protein the cell needs at the moment. Real alternative splicing leads to the exclusion or inclusion of a functional domain of a protein (leading to different cellular localization or loss of 1 of 2 functions, depending on cell type).Smith talks-down to the common reader by explaining science in baby-language. He makes nonsense analogies and calls a spliceosome a \\"code-scrambler\\", introns \\"signal beacons\\" and glycosylation \\"hitchhikers\\". The second chapter is devoted to 20 ways genetic engineering can go wrong. He ends up naming various cellular processes and trying to connect it with reasons why GMOs are dangerous. It feels like a total stretch. Smith spins you around in this new scary world of science, where scientists don't know what the heck they're dealing with and every molecule is out to get you! The EFFECT IS NOT TO TEACH, IT IS TO CONFUSE!This book is an exciting read...If only real science were as exciting! Discussing the danger or safety of genetic modification is a scientific topic. If you really want to participate in it (which is great), then you will have to consider that it will take a lot of time and effort to gain the necessary background information. Safety of GMOs must be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on the presence of the transgenic protein. Also, consider that GMOs are a complex topic, with pros and cons, with the pros including reduced pesticide use (which is well-documented, not just Monsanto propaganda). Oh, and so you know, allergenicity testing is a requirement of the FDA for the release of GM crops.Pusztai Reference: [...]"},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith has given us a devastating and authoritative indictment of the safety of Genetically Modified foods, the corruption and greed of big business and of the failure of government agencies to protect us. To cover GM soy in my book \\"The Whole Soy Story,\\" I investigated Monsanto's testing methods and found numerous examples of experimental manipulation, misinterpretation, falsified conclusions and flagrant disregard of data. So I have no doubt that the testing of the FlavrSavr tomato, StarLink corn and other GM seeds was similarly inadequate, incomplete and rigged to reach favorable conclusions. I am particularly pleased that Smith honors the brilliance and integrity of Dr. Arpad Pusztai, whose honest revelation that GM potatoes cause immune, brain, and reproductive damage cost him his job and exposed him to vicious attacks by Monsanto and the British government. Here in the USA, the FDA bills itself as \\"The Nation's Foremost Consumer Protection Agency.\\" Yet its handling of GM seeds shows that it is not only being asleep on the job but in bed with big business. As consumers, we must demand independent safety assessments, let food manufacturers know that we will not eat GM foods and, most important, vote with our pocketbooks. Thank you Jeffrey Smith for giving us the evidence and motivation to do so."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Monsanto doesn't want you to read this book. They know you will be angry. And you will be totally right to be angry.First of all, let's examine closely what a corporation like Monsanto is. Big corporations always try to get hold on a monopoly. The advantage of a monopoly is that the free market is eliminated. Think oil, central banks, patented drugs, patented pesticides, etc. More recently genetically modified seeds were developed, 75 % of which are engineered to withstand the otherwise deadly application of an herbicide - naturally : the brand the same corporation produces (\\"Roundup Ready\\"). Excellent news for stockholders of Monsanto, but what's in it for us, poor consumers ? Well, actually, as this book explains very well : absolutely nothing.This was a huge challenge for the marketing department of Monsanto to start with. They try to sell us the idea that GM crops will \\"eliminate hunger in the Third World\\". This is absurd : hunger is not caused by lack of food, but by its unequal distribution. Therefore, the Rockefeller Foundation came up with another strategy. They funded the development of \\"golden rice\\", which would \\"prevent blindness and infection in millions of children' suffering from vitamin-A deficiency\\". Or how to complicate a simple problem. Why not educate poor people to grow vegetables on the margins of their rice fields ? Or why not considering distributing vitamin A tablets ? \\"At a cost of only $.05 per tablet, only $25,000 is needed to prevent 500,000 children from going blind per year. Contrast this with golden rice, which has cost more than $100 million dollars so far, and is not yet ready\\", the author says. On top of this, the \\"golden rice\\" provides so little vitamin A a two-year-old child would need to eat seven pounds per day. Likewise, an adult would need to eat nearly twenty pounds to get the daily recommended dose.On top of that, the scarce investigation available shows that GM crops have *less nutritional value* than natural crops. Dr. Arpad Pusztai discovered that GM potatoes provide 20 % less proteins than natural species. Roundup Ready soy has also significantly lower levels of protein and other important nutrients, but higher levels of a potentially damaging lectin.Animals sense the potential danger of GM crops. If cows, hogs, mice, squirrels, elk, deer and raccoons can choose, they leave the GM crops alone. This is a huge problem when experiments are performed on GM crops. Rats didn't want to eat the \\"immortal\\" tomato - still fresh, red and ripe... 150 days after picking... They had to be force-fed this artificial \\"food\\". The rodents knew something was wrong, and they were right. Seven of forty animals died within two weeks. Consequently, the tomato was approved. Huh ? Yeah, I am sorry. If you still believe the FDA was there to protect your health, time to wake up ! The FDA considers GM crops \\"substantially equivalent\\" to natural crops, and no experiment whatsoever will change its view on this matter. The FDA has in fact turned into the Washington branch office of Monsanto and Big Pharma.Probably, you won't be aware that GM crops are abundant in the current diet, in *your* current diet. \\"GM foods are a regular part of the U.S. diet. Approximately 80 percent of the soy and 38 percent of the corn planted in the U.S. in 2003 is genetically engineered. Derivatives from these two crops are found in about 70 percent of processed foods. In addition, 70 percent of the cotton crop and more than 60 percent of the canola crop, both used for cooking oil, are also genetically modified\\".Scientists like Dr. Arpad Pusztai are astonished : \\"I find that it is very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs. We have to find the guinea pigs in the laboratory.\\" But the FDA prefers to use the whole US-population for this purpose. The record so far is the following : \\"According to a March 2001 article in the New York Times, \\"The CDC (Center for Disease Control) now says that food is responsible for twice the number of illnesses in the United States as scientists thought just seven years ago... At least 80 percent of food-related illnesses are caused by viruses or other pathogens that scientists cannot even identify.\\" The reported cases include 5,000 deaths, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 76 million illnesses per year. This increase roughly corresponds to the period when Americans have been eating GM food.\\"Digestion problems, irritable bowel syndrome, acne, eczema, headaches, chronic fatigue syndrome and lethargy are all possible complaints when eating genetically modified Roundup Ready soy, following John Graham of the York Laboratory.The last chapter of this book deals with how to avoid GM crops in your menu.

The second aspect of the book is an absolutely damning description of the FDA and the EPA and their failure in the role of protecting the food supply and the environment.

This book does a great job of clearly explaining the complex process of genetically modifying a food's DNA and the unintended consequences that happen along the way. It also goes into great detail explaining the politics involved and the massive influence biotech companies have had on the FDA and EPA. Additionally these biotechs influence research coming out of universities. Biotech companies provide grants to the universities and can thus decide what gets published and what does not. The simple fact is that testing of these GE foods has been left to the biotech companies that create them. Most people would consider this a conflict of interest however this is the policy of the FDA (this policy was mostly shaped by a former Monsanto lawyer). The use of GE growth hormones is also widely used in cattle to increase milk production. The main takeaway from this is rBGH (a GE growth hormone) causes mastitis (udder infection) causing pus to be released into milk. Feel like a milkshake now? Prior to reading this book I had no idea how many foods contained GMOs. The main GE crops are corn, soybeans, canola, and cotton. Corn and soy are in a ton of foods so most of us have been consuming GE foods for years without knowing it. Sadly, the US and Canada are two of the few countries that do not label GE food. Even China labels food containing GE ingredients! The biotechs have lead a massive smear campaign against anyone speaking out on the dangers of GMOs, including distinguished biotech scientist, calling them Luddites and accusing them of hidden agendas. There is a great opportunity coming up to vote on whether or not foods containing GMOs should be labeled. The vote is in CA and it is Prop 37. If you live in CA please do your own due diligence and vote on this very important matter that affects us all.

Some corporationsare greedy and unethical. It is easy to believe bad things about FDA. The CYA attitudethat bureaucracy fosters in bureaucrats, and the common pattern of industries coopting theregulators, make the accusations against the FDA easy to believe, and even easy to expect.What is not so easy to believe is the overall message of the book. All genetically modifiedfoods are bad for you. They are less nutritious than the natural alternative, and will harmyou in one or many ways such as allergies, cancer, nervous disorders, ulcers, reduced intelligence.sexual problems, misformed children, or many more, and any evidence to the contrary is fakedby our corrupt government and the evil corporations in this vast biotech conspiracy.There are interesting parallels between the beliefs in this book and the beliefs of creationismor intelligent design, and also with the catastrophic anthropomorphic global warming alarmists.There are extensive notes of sources and an index, so you can use this book to help you argueagainst engineered foods, or to search for arguments against the claims in the book. The phrase\\"precautionary principle\\" does not appear in the index, and I do not recall seeing it in thetext, but the idea is stated repeatedly: genetic engineering should not be done until it hasbeen proven safe for many generations. Essentially, nothing should ever be done for the firsttime.While most of attack is against genetically engineered foods in general, with the usual weaselwords such as \\"might\\", \\"could\\", \\"linked\\", and \\"Believed\\", there are also specific claims againstcertain foods. There might be more such specific claims than recalls of organic foods after thedeath of consumers, but I'm not sure of it.The last chapter is a commercial for the book. You should buy lots of copies and give them toeveryone that is not aware of the evil plot. There is also information about how to avoid theevil food. Unless you are already in the know, you are probably eating it now. That makes mewonder where all the bodies are hid, and why life expectancy keeps going up.Smith has another book out, same topic. I have not seen it yet.

As I read the book, I entered into a world of deception regarding the regulation of our food safety. It made me realize how corrupt our government really is. The FDA doesn't have our health in mind, it is all about greed. The biotech industry's corporate leaders and scientists have formed a revolving door with positions at the FDA. This infiltration of biotech advocates into the government allowed incomplete testing and manipulated data that was pushed through regulation before anyone could object. When their own scientists showed concerns about the safety of the GMO products, they were fired. Monsanto and the other big biotech companies didn't want anything to stand in their way. They had plans to replace every seed in nature with a genetically modified organism (GMO)version. This way they controlled the seeds, they controlled the food, and therefore the world.The increase in disease in America has been on the rise since GMOs were introduced into our food. Independent studies have repeatedly shown that GMOs have a direct correlation to the rise in GI problems, immune system degradation, cancerous tumors of the breast, decreased fertility, damaged organs, multiple system failure, and dysfunctional regulation of cholesterol and insulin over the lifetime of a rat. Monsanto's studies were only 90 days long, which was insufficient to determine that these products are safe. The research shows that the adverse effects in the rats weren't apparent until the 4th month and continually got worse over the 2 year life span of the rats. There haven't been any human studies on GMOs, it was pushed on the market in the name of \\"progress\\". Unfortunately, we are the study...we are the lab rats.This book reveals it all, and how it is up to the individuals to collectively use our purchasing power to arrive at a tipping point. The power belongs to the people, but we have to speak up, speak out and form a united front to put this abomination to rest by getting the right to know what's in our food. We need to gather together with petitions and get labeling laws passed. The majority of Americans would not buy products with GMOs if they knew a product contained them.

I highly recommend it if you are interested in your health.As a biologist who has worked with DNA, and respect it, I place great value on Smith's easy to understand explanation on the genetic engineering process on DNA. Smith has also carefully researched FDA reports and quoted several people in his analysis of GMOs and their impact on society. With methodological precision, his research reveals the close ties of the U.S. government with biotechnology industry in several aspects of GMO production. Even more disturbing is the influence of biotechnology companies such as Monsanto, Novartis, Dow, and DuPont having on the government - they gave more than 3.5 million dollars (from 1995-2000) towards campaign contributions, with 3/4 going to Republicans.His research also reveals the impact of the genetically modifed amino acid L-tryptophan in 1989-1990 that debilitated thousands of people with EMS, a disease that produces severe muscle pain, and even death. Forty people died from taking this L-tryptophan. This product was never labled that it was genetically modified and the Japanese manufacturer - Showa Denko KK did not use the proper filtration level to remove the impurities. Subsequent from these health risks, the product was removed from shelves.My favorite quotes from this book came from George Wald, Nobel Laureate in Medicine. He said for genetic engineeering - \\"The results will be essentially new organisms, self-perpetuating and hence permanent. Once created, they cannot be recalled\\" and \\"Up to now, living organisms have evolved very slowly and new forms have had plenty of time to settle in.

During the late 70s and early 80s, when genetic engineering was coming on the scene, I was a strong supporter.Over the years I talked to various biotech scientists who were becoming worried about whether the genetically-modified foods entering the food chain were safe. As the science developed, it was discovered the process of genetic engineering is anything but as straightforward as scientists originally thought. Chunks of genetic material jump all over the place once they are inserted into plants, and there is no predicting where they will go, or what effect they will have. There has been almost no research on the safety of genetically-modified foods, and what little has been done has shown these foods can cause a number of health problems ranging from allergies to food intolerances to cancer.Both Canadian and US government agencies have taken the position (urged on by the biotech companies) that these new food crops are 'substantially similar' to existing crops, so do not need any study for food safety. And both governments are strong supporters of the industry, as I used to be.The scientists I talked to became less and less willing to voice their concerns for fear of reprisals.A few years ago, because of the knowledge I had gained, I began to make a point of avoiding GMOs, which is increasingly difficult, as they are spreading everywhere.We are being screwed over and lied to by the biotech industry and our governments, and this book tells the story well and thoroughly."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"Jeffrey Smith, the author of this book, is a plain-spoken but hardly elegant writer. He doesn't need to be; the facts he reports about GM (genetically modified) foods and the relentless efforts of Monsanto Corp. to get them into American and world markets need no dressing up in fancy prose. It's hard to decide which is scariest: the grave doubts about the safety of specific products such as the FlavrSavr tomato and StarLink corn; the myriad possibilities for unpredictable results to the environment and the general food supply, given the current scanty knowledge of genes, genetics and the possible consequences of unchecked modification of basic biological codes; or the systematic, epidemic failure of governmental agencies charged with protecting the health of the general public in the U.S. and Canada to act.It would be easy to dismiss &quot;Seeds of Deception&quot; as a partisan rant against Republican governments and big business, but Smith is evenhanded in his indictments. According to him, Monsanto Corp. has engaged in a systematic campaign to pressure both Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States to allow GM foods to be marketed without proper safeguards and testing. What seems to have saved the world so far is the vigorous resistance of European and overseas markets to the entry of genetically modified food products that have not been properly tested, consquently making several highly promoted products uneconomical to produce. Nevertheless, modified genes have already &quot;escaped&quot; into the general food supply to an alarming degree.In the final portion of the book Smith gives suggestions on how the reader can protect him/herself against unknowingly consuming GM foodstuffs, and also asks for contributions so that copies of his book can be sent to those in positions of power. I'm sending him a check."},{"Title":"Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating","review":"I have not tracked the genetically engineered food issue carefully, having only seen mainstream media reporting.BEFORE I started reading this book, I thought that:1. The genetic engineering technique is very precise and duplicatable, inserting single genes into a plant's DNA that do a precise job.2. Genetically modified (GM) food is essentialy the same as the non-GM counterpart.3. There are few if any known serious health risks from eating most GM food4. GM practices can reduce pesticide use because the plant has its own pesticide. This is an environmental benefit.5. GM food can increase yields, given the same amount of land for growing - which has been a great benefit in some third world countries.6. There are considerable environmental risks that have probably not been ade1quately studied. For example, monarch butterflies were being harmed in GM fields.Overall I felt that the issue was not very clear cut, there were great advantages, but caution is also advised.AFTER I read this book, I learned that:1. The GM technique is extremely imprecise, it is like shooting a shotgun of genes at a bunch of DNA strands, and hoping a few stick. Furthermore, the surrounding genes suffer considerable collateral damage that is impossible to predict the effects of.2. This collateral damage results in GM food often being very different from the non-GM version, especially in increase of toxins and allergens.3. There are a number of well documented cases of people getting very sick, and some cases dying from these toxins and allergens.Yet, the FDA and GM biotech industry and mainstream media continues to say that there is little evidence of health risk.4. One of the most pervasive GM foods is Monsanto's Ready Roundup soy bean. It is specifically designed to be resistant to Monsanto's brand of pesticide. This results in MORE of that pesticide being used.5. The argument about increased yields to save the planet is often used as a last resort when you point out the truth about GM being an imprecise technique, and that there are serious health risks. It is a way of bringing in a moral dimension that most people will buy. Yet, the planet already has much more food than it needs to feed everyone. This is not the reason for GM foods. Profit is.6. The environmental risks may be many and unstudied, to be sure. Much more shocking is that there are hardly any careful studies demonstrating that GM food is safe. Basically, scientificaly weak arguments are use to argue that there is no reason to conduct such studies.This is barely scratching the surface, this book is extremely well written and documented. It tells a sobering story of:* Corporate greed,* Rampant conflict of interest with industry being in bed with the FDA, for example:- Scientists warnings are routinely ignored- Monsanto officials come to work at the FDA to make policy, then return to Monsanto- The doctoring of information is much like what the current Bush adminstration has done with scentific reports about global warming.* Most funding for research in GM comes from industry.* People are afraid to do research that might discover inconvenient truths about the safety of GM foods - because they are bullied, threatened and can lose their careers.* Massive media manipulation filters out virtually all anti-GM stories; books have gone unpublished for fear of lawsuits by pro-GM companies* Pro-biotech companies and the FDA itself have ample evidence of safety concerns, and they consistently lie about it. It reminds me of the tobacco situation.Some may complain that this book does not present a balanced view. You be the judge. And anyway, even if it is one one-sided, its about that that this side was aired.But don't take it from me, or from the author. Read the book, check the references, and reach your own conclusions. Even if only a few things in this book are true, it has major consequences.I recommend that anyone who cares about their health, and their future read this book right away!!!

Pick up any Adbusters or Mother Jones magazine and you'll find a plethora of ways corporations have sold the environment, animals and human health to the highest bidder. What's fun (or horrific, depending on your mood) is learning the specifics. Seeds of Deception delves into the details of genetically modified (GM) food: what we should know about the politics, science and investment behind the industry.One of the many issues the book raises is that GM food is almost impossible to distinguish, since it's generally not labeled here in the United States. Companies, such as Monsanto, spend millions, if not billions, of dollars keeping the public happy and ignorant about the lack of testing behind their products. They even have some pretty smart folks believing GM food is going to feed the world and cure blindness in Third World countries. It's taken a lot of dough to create that groupthink. As we've learned from pharmaceuticals, the cigarette industry and the meat and dairy industries, when a company is willing to spend that kind of money on public relations, someone's putting frosting on a mud pie.Peppered with anecdotes about animals choosing non-GM food over GM food, Smith's evidence of scientific and political cover-up is startling. It's impossible to ignore the evidence in this book. Even if only a fraction of it is true, we're in some serious crap. The problem comes down to a simple statement Smith quotes from geneticist, David Suzuki: \\"Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying. The experiments have simply not been done.\\"Seeds of Deception's chapter \\"Muscling the Media\\" discusses corporate strategy to eliminate media reporting on GM food in the United States. \\"Under the auspices of the public relations and lobby firm Capitoline/MS&L;, they [GM giant Monsanto] created a plan to identify and then stifle those reporters and reports that were critical of rbGH.\\" (rbGH is the infamous growth hormone that makes cows produce more milk - horrible stuff.) The question remains: Doesn't Smith worry about being slammed and discarded like the many journalists and writers he describes? His book isn't going to show up on Oprah anytime soon - or is it? If enough people consider the seriousness of the topic, Seeds of Deception won't fall by the wayside.If you have room for another New Year's resolution, please let it be to follow the suggestions in this book. Eat organic, locally-produced food. Feed your children organic food and encourage schools to look into the realities of GM food in their cafeterias. Avoid certain foods altogether (like non-organic papaya from Hawaii, for example, which has a 50% chance of being GM) and encourage restaurants to eliminate GM food from their menus.Seeds of Deception will open your eyes - eyes that, from then on, will search for organic alternatives to take-your-chances, you-might-be-a-guinea-pig ingredients.

They had absolutely no idea that what they were doing would come to be called the \\"Green Revolution\\", or that their efforts to help the hungry feed themselves would be hijacked. They did not have any sense of the controversies that would dog their efforts in the decades ahead. Quite frankly, their motivation was kindness, as can be seen in the following quotes:1) \\"The wisdom of our actions in the first three years of peace will determine the course of world history for half a century.\\"--Henry A. Wallace (pg. 334)2) \\"You can't build a peaceful world on empty stomachs and human misery.\\"--Norman Borlaug (pg. 334)3) Exacerbating all of these issues was a reality that stunned Norm [Borlaug]. Coming from a family that valued education above almost all else, it seemed unfathomable to Norm that only about twenty percent of the Mexican farmers were literate. In a letter to Margaret, Norm expressed his bewilderment at the challenge that lay ahead. \\"These places I've seen have clubbed my mind--they are so poor and depressing. No wonder the people are the way they are. Can you imagine a poor Mexican guy struggling to feed his family? I don't know what we can do to help these people, but we've got to do something!\\" (pg. 337)4) The bombs had yet to fall on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that horrible summer of 1945. Therefore, Edward Lorenz was still at his station in the Pacific. He was still trying to predict the weather for the Army Air Corp. He had yet to articulate the theory of \\"sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\\" It is thus surprising that one day, while explaining to a group of Champingo College staff the reasoning behind the \\"high-volume crossbreeding\\" approach, Norm (Borlaug) almost seemed to intuit the highly random and chaotic essence of the \\"butterfly effect.\\"\\"There are millions of wheat plants here. Each head will grow a couple of dozen grains of seed, and there will not be one seed in billions that will be totally acceptable for what we need in Mexico. Perfection is a butterfly the academics chase and never catch. If we go on looking for the ideal wheat for Mexico, your countrymen will go on being hungry for a long time. We will have to do the best we can with what we have.\\" (pg. 340)__________________________By the way, the Green Revolution did not actually begin with Norman Borlaug in Mexico, it began in Des Moines, Iowa. In May 1926 when seven men met in the offices of Wallaces' Farmer:\\"They formed a corporation--Hi-Bred Corn Company. They agreed to sell themselves seventy shares of stock at $100 per share. By purchasing fifty shares himself, Henry [Wallace] was the majority stock holder. The other men purchased the remaining twenty shares. By the end of the first year the company had sold 650 bushels of hybrid seed corn, for a net profit of about $30. The partners were delighted.

Successes and achievements of GMOs are completely ignored while mishaps are relentlessly hammered upon.The basic premise of the book is that the process of genetic engineering somehow corrupts the target organism and everything derived from it thereafter. By blasting the biotech industry and government agencies, Smith paints a picture of wanton disregard for safety issues and shifty cover-ups aimed at keeping the public ignorant. The author sort of oscillates between a tone of hysterical panic pronouncing that we're all sure to perish soon if something isn't done and a more reasonable tone that suggests further tests are needed to demonstrate the safety of GMO products. Each chapter is preceded by a cute little story about some animal or another preferring natural over GMO food. No corroboration is provided for these word of mouth stories and I'm sure that if you looked hard enough you could find examples in which animals chose GMO over non. The book concludes with a call for activism by the reader. I just pray that potential activists do not base their conclusions solely on this book.Vague claims are used to bash biotechnology. What does it mean that only \\"1% of people think that GMOs are good for society\\"? Does this mean that 99% think that it is bad? What exactly do the \\"superficial government studies\\" entail? What is the basis for the claim that a single fruit fly gene may code for 38,000 distinct proteins? By using strong sounding but vague arguments such as these, Smith aims to convince the reader to follow his view by providing carefully selected bits of information.Smith's explanations of molecular biology and techniques used in genetic engineering are pathetic and presented in a way to influence the reader to distrust GM products. As a molecular biologist, I can assure you that Smith's claim that \\"no control over how many genes, in what order, or where they are inserted\\" is bogus. Relatively simple and straight-forward experiments (Southern blotting and PCR) can be and are conducted to determine exactly these things.The idea that there is some sort of conspiracy between industry, government, the media, and even independent scientists is absolutely ridiculous. Smith attributes the fact that you don't hear many scientists voicing concerns over GMO food products to some sort threat by evil and powerful men, while in reality it stems from the fact that scientists as a whole support GM technology and would generally argue in favor of its safety. Scare tactics, distorted \\"facts\\" and partial information can make a strong impression on someone not familiar with the topic of genetic engineering. Not so much on scientists well-versed in molecular biology (sorry Jeffrey).Basically, this is a dangerous book that will influence many people to fear GMOs and may result in governments passing laws that will slow progress in a field that has so much potential to accomplish good for the world.

Newly discovered records traces this back to the 1920s and plans to prepare for a possible war with Japan. This plus new information on experiences of people of Japanese descent in the Justice and War Departments' camps for internees from Alaska, Hawaii and Latin America makes for an important, different guide which blends diaries, contemporary sources, and official communications in a revealing history."},{"Title":"Judgment without Trial: Japanese American Imprisonment during World War II","review":"This book is a comprehensive look at some of the major reasons for the internment of Japanese and Japanese Americans during WW2. Many people think that racial hatred of Japanese started with the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, but actually this was only the culmination of years of anti Japanese feelings , especially on the west coast. Most of the first generation Japanese were farmers, and they made what was once thought to be barren wasteland into some of the most productive land in the US. However, the 1920 Land Act prohibited all Japanese nationals from owning any land, and first generation Japanese were PROHIBITED from becoming US citizens, laws influenced by racist white farmers to prevent any more Japanese from owning farm land. The ever resourceful Issei (first generation Japanese) bypassed this by putting their land in their childrens (by law, American citizens) names. In 1924, the Congress and President Coolidge passed the Anti-Asian exclusion act, which prohibited any more immigration by Japanese (and other Asians) (for an excellent reference, see Roger Daniels \\"The Politics of Prejudice\\" for an authoritative look at the laws used to discriminate against Japanese during the early 20th century). In addition, Newspaper publishers like William Randolph Hearst were making large efforts to inflame anti Japanese sentiment in their newspapers.When Pearl Harbor occured, mass hysteria ensued. Many Japanese owned businesses were burned and looted and homes of Japanese families were vandalized and attacked. It was Feb. 1942 when Executive Order 9066 effectively gave all persons of Japanese ancestry, some times as little as 72 hours, time to pack their belongings, settle their affairs, and report for \\"relocation\\" (a euphemism if there ever was one).One last fact that a previous reviewer conveniently doesn't mention- The US Army's 442nd and 100th all Nisei(second generation) combat units, comprising nearly 10,000 men, were the most decorated units for their size in the history of the United States.While their families were locked up or prevented from returning to their lawful homes, \\"these brave men fought prejudice and won\\" - spoken by Pres. Harry Truman in 1945 in a ceremony honoring the 442nd and 100th battalions.Its on archival news reels, for any doubters out there.A previous reviewer says that the WW2 internment of Japanese Americans was NOT due to racial hatred and prejudice- this book and a look at history and the congressional record for the aforementioned anti-Japanese legislation would prove him dead WRONG."},{"Title":"Judgment without Trial: Japanese American Imprisonment during World War II","review":"The book Judgment Without Trial primarily focuses on the process by which U.S. authorities impounded people of Japanese descent (both alien and first generation American) from the West Coast, Hawaii and Latin America. Additionally, the author asserts that racial prejudice and political expedience were the primary motivations behind the government's plans to indefinitely hold these foreign nationals and their children under duress without charge, evidence, or due process. This secondary assertion aside, the book primarily focuses on how this process was conceived, organized, and implemented by the Justice Department, the War Relocation Authority, and the army.Tetsuden Kashima argues that our present-day characterization of this mass imprisonment as a wartime \\"mistake\\" ignores the fact that the imprisonment of Japanese, both foreign nationals and American citizens, was conceived by high-level officials decades before the United States entered the war. The federal government's decision and plans were therefore not made in haste, or because of \\"hysteria\\" following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Kashima further asserts that the federal Japanese imprisonment organization went far beyond the establishment of a few assembly and relocation centers. Government public relations pronouncements to the contrary, he claims the organization created by the Roosevelt administration was large, complex, and oppressive.The book is organized around a series of themes. One concerns the problem of organizational disputes among the agencies. Another addresses the problem of control of the prisoner population. A third theme examines the way in which the imprisonment organization dealt with the unanticipated needs that arose in regard to the prisoners. Yet another theme concerns the actual control methods used in the centers.The first three chapters chronologically present the evolution and deployment of the internment process. Chapters four and five deal with the U.S. government's treatment the Japanese living in Hawaii and Latin American. The last five chapters concern life in the camps themselves, and the physical and psychological hardships inflicted upon the internees. The book concludes with sixty eight pages of notes and charts, along with a bibliography section containing over two hundred entries.The book appears to be thoroughly researched. Kashima's sources include personal correspondence, diaries, interviews, books, magazine articles, official government reports, along with court briefs, transcripts, and records.Judgment Without Trial succeeds in making its case that the U.S. government began planning for the internment of the Japanese American population long before the first bomb fell onto Pearl Harbor. Also, Kashima's description of the creation and implementation of the program is illuminating. However, the book falls short in presenting objective proof of deliberate U.S. government's abused of Japanese foreign nationals and their American-born children. His evidence for the assertion that animosity toward Japanese-Americans affected the general tenor of the treatment they received is mostly anecdotal, and ignores the very real threat to our West Coast by Japan. Our commercial shipping was under constant threat by Japanese submarines following the destruction of our Pacific fleet - those same submarines actually fired missiles at our undefended coast. Also, evidence obtained from decoded Japanese diplomatic communications (the so-called \\"MAGIC\\" files) revealing the threat of a Japanese espionage networks on the West Coast is never mentioned By Kashima."},{"Title":"Judgment without Trial: Japanese American Imprisonment during World War II","review":"The final chapter of any book is that in which most authors wrap up their ideas. Kashima does it well in the last chapter of his book:\\"During and after World War II, the U.S. government imprisoned nearly 120,000 Nikkei, the majority of whom were American citizens. They were detained in imprisonment centers without being charged with the commission of crimes, deprived of legal counsel and trials, and incarcerated, in most instances, for no stated justifiable reason or specified duration.\\"Kashima utilizes a rebuttal often used in many books of this nature: \\"No evidence exists that any Issei or Nisei resident of the United States... ever committed an act of espionage or sabotage.\\" They contend then that the Nikkei's \\"only crime was the accident of nationality or parentage.\\" They do err, unfortunately, in their declaration of innocence for all Nikkei, on this major point -- the issue for the Nisei was not crime, conviction, or even accusation. The need, then, for courts or hearings becomes a moot point; there were a number of high profile court cases, however, but none proved any government action unconstitutional. The main issue for the Issei, however, was entirely different, made so by a belligerent act by Imperial Japan -- the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor -- when the Japanese residents in the US suddenly became America's enemies. That status made action imperative -- in fact, the public demanded that something be done with the Japanese on the West Coast.It is most unfortunate that Kashima, though studying quite fastidiously the trees, has failed to correctly comprehend the forest. The major detraction from this commendable research is his insistance on imprisonment and incarceration of the Nikkei. This sad dirge in the minor key is commonly sung by those who believe the US Government did them wrong during WWII. Though their bitterness may be real, their accusations are, however, without basis.Thousands of Issei and Nisei were never in any assembly or relocation centers, and thousands upon thousands more spent very little time there, having moved out to jobs or colleges elsewhere in the United States. Thousands of others enjoyed their time in the centers, and indeed, preferred life there than on the outside. Furthermore, any Nikkei had easy access to legal counsel, at any time.The majority of the evacuated Nikkei were cared for by the US Government in many special ways. For former center inhabitants to ignore this fact, and to demean US leadership, is to bite the hand that fed them. Kashima lumps the entire WWII experience of the Nikkei in assembly and relocation centers, as well as in detention and isolation camps, and calls it \\"imprisonment\\" and \\"incarceration\\" in \\"concentration camps.\\"Perhaps one of the keys to understanding Kashima's lack of factual data to backup these final observations of his may be found in the caption for the illustration on the jacket cover of the book: \\"Guard Tower, water color and ink painting by Kenjiro Nomura, Minidoka Relocation Center, Idaho, 1942-43.\\" The \\"guard towers\\" drawn in the illustration were in actuality water towers -- one such photo from Aug. 1942 has the caption, \\"One of the several water towers which serves the Minidoka War Relocation Authority center.\\" Granted, there were guard towers at the relocation centers; insistence they were there to control or even terrorize the occupants of the centers is a hysterical conclusion, however.As for the barbed wire fence with 45-degree top brackets (inward slant specifically for stopping escapees) in the illustration, there is no photo proof of such a fence. Even if such a high-security type of fencing actually existed at Minidoka, what would have been the need of it? The evacuees were free to leave the center to work out in the expansive fields surrounding Minidoka, to take walks along the canal, to go swimming at the pool (skating in the winter), etc.Another excerpt: \\"After the signing of EO 9066, all families on the West Coast and in the territory of Alaska, and others in Hawaii and Latin America, were either interned or incarcerated.\\" Unbeknownst to Kashima, he has effectively destroyed his credibility in this sweeping statement. I find myself again blinking my eyes in amazement as I re-read those words. Granted, he means Nikkei families, but \\"all\\"? Somehow his research has degraded into generalizations and blanket statements.One more excerpt: \\"Japanese Americans have conducted their lives for decades under the social cloud of the incarceration and, unable to banish it, have lived with the stigma.\\" Kashima then has a quote by Congressman Matsui, which also betrays similar bitterness about the evacuation and lack of discernment regarding the so-called \\"stigma,\\" due to the trauma of having their \\"faith in the government and the strength of the U.S. Constitution... shaken during World War II\\" because \\"their government... had refused to protect them from outside prejudices,\\" and worse, wanted to deport them.And there you have the crux of this book: The American populace is to blame for injustices against their fellow Americans and for creating a stigma they endure to this day. Americans must be aware of this so that it will never happen again.Interesting. I've heard that \\"never again\\" phrase somewhere before. Ah yes, it was stated twice, in the beginning of the film, and at the end, a 1944 film entitled \\"Betrayal from the East,\\" which is a dramatized version of a real event, showing the danger of espionage and sabotage from among the Nikkei on the West Coast. Fortunately, THAT has not happened again.Kashima once again had an opportunity to redeem the injustices done in \\"Personal Justice Denied.\\" He followed the mainstream once again, sadly, though with a new twist -- that of \\"predetermined\\" racism and internment.Personal justice has once again been denied -- the personal justice for individuals such as DeWitt, McCloy, Bendetsen, and even Franklin D. Roosevelt. Where is any sense of justice for them? Not to be found in writings of this caliber."},{"Title":"Judgment without Trial: Japanese American Imprisonment during World War II","review":"These folks just won't stop. Kashima is a reparations demagogue who like his activist reparations colleagues is bent on re-writing the history of Japanese-American espionage before Pearl Harbor. MAGIC intelligence was the reason for the evacuation. If you want an accurate portrayal of the history, read \\"MAGIC\\" by retired National Security Agency Executuve David Lowman. The declassified documents will be enough to convince fair minded readers.Until Japanese-Americans fess up to the darker chapters of their own history and quit attempting to portray themselves as victims and the U.S. government as racists this issue will always be controversial. Version of events of Kashima's ilk will always be taken with a grain of salt by the majority of Americans.Did you know:1. It is not true that Japanese-Americans were \\"interned\\". Only Japanese nationals (enemy aliens) arrested and given individual hearings were interned. Such persons were held for deportation in Department of Justice camps. Those evacuated were not interned. They were first given an opportunity to voluntarily move to areas outside the military zones. Those unable or unwilling to do so were sent to Relocation Centers operated by the War Relocation Authority.2. During the war, more than 33,000 evacuees voluntarily left the relocation centers to accept outside employment in areas outside of the military zones. An additional 4,300 left to attend colleges in the East.3. Approximately two-thirds of the ADULTS among those evacuated were Japanese nationals--enemy aliens subject to detention under long-standing law. The vast majority of evacuated Japanese-Americans (U.S. citizens) were children at the time. Their average age was only 15 years. In addition, between 50 and 75 percent of Japanese-Americans over age 17 were also citizens of Japan (dual citizens) under Japanese law. Thousands had been educated in Japan, some having returned to the U.S. holding reserve rank in the Japanese armed forces.4. In a recent study made by the National Park Service for the Manzanar memorial site, it was revealed that during the war over 26% of Japanese Americans over military age said they would refuse to swear an unqualified oath of allegiance to the United States.5. According to War Relocation Authority records, 13,000 applications renouncing their U.S. citizenship and requesting expatriation to Japan were filed by or on behalf of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Over 5,000 such applications had been processed by the end of the war.6. The evacuation was not motivated by racism, as so often claimed today, but by information obtained by the U.S. from pre-war decoded Japanese diplomatic messages (MAGIC) and other intelligence revealing the existence of espionage and the potential for sabotage involving then-unidentified resident Japanese aliens and Japanese-Americans living within the West Coast Japanese community. Many of these messages and associated intelligence documents have since been declassified and are available in a number of historical publications.Don't fall for what Kashima and his activist buddies are feeding the public...."},{"Title":"Roadmap to the Virginia SOL: EOC Virginia and United States History (State Test Preparation Guides)","review":"As a teacher in the Commonwealth of Virginia, I wanted to use this review book to help my students prepare for the SOL test.

John W. Allen wrote a column, \\"It Happened in Southern Illinois,\\" in the Carbondale newspaper for many years, and these columns are collected in this fine book. Allen himself was born in a log cabin in 1887, and knew the folkways of his region well.Included are profiles of prominent Southen Illinoisians like William Jennings Bryan, Pierre Menard, and William Edgar Borah; and legendary figures like riverman Mike Fink (who could outshoot Davy Crockett and who once jumped halfway across the Mississippi and, realizing he would fall a few feet short of the opposite shore, turned around and went back)and tavern-keeping outlaw Willlie Potts. There are stories of Abraham Lincoln, Lafayette, George Rogers Clark, Pontiac, Robert Ingersoll, Ned Buntline, Johnny Appleseed, Daniel Boone, and other historical figures who came here.Ghost tales, local superstitions, home remedies, sketches of pioneer and farm life, are not neglected. We learn the differing theories on how \\"Egypt\\" came by its name, how numerous towns acquired theirs, and how industry and business developed in the area.We meet William Newby, the soldier who disappeared during the Civil War and whose attempts to reunite with his family many years later led to persecution and imprisonment as an old man. There are also blacksmiths, itinerant peddlers, river pirates, tall-tale tellers, and other long-vanished characters of the American scene.Allen's affectionate yet clear-eyed prose avoids the usual traps of books on the folkways of the rural past. This is neither a dry piece of scholarship (\\"A variant on Tale 17 was found in __________, on September 7, 19__, related by Mrs. __________________.\\")nor a collection of rose-colored, sentimental reminiscences of interest only to the teller. And at some 400 pages, it's no skimpy sampler. It's a 10-gallon jug of cider, a big bushel basket of freshly-picked Southern Illinois peaches; and you can reach in anywhere and pull out a good one.Reading this book is like taking a long, leisurely stroll with the author along the town streets, through the woods, along the rivers, and even in the graveyards. You can almost smell the musty barns, lye soap, and sorghum; and hear the drawling voice of the local sage holding court around the pot-bellied stove in the general store, and the kids playing in the yard of a one-room school.I still read this fine book on cold nights, and never tire of its winding trails of information. Whether you come from this fascinating and mysterious part of the country (closer to the Tennesse hills than to Chicago)or simply are curious about a vanished past, Legends and Lore will keep you both informed and entertained.P.S. Editor Irving Dilliard's introduction alone is almost worth the price of the book. He gives us a (too brief) introduction to the long and often adventurous life of John W. Allen, known as \\"The best friend Southern Illinois ever had.\\" What a pity Allen never wrote his autobiography."},{"Title":"Legends & lore of southern Illinois","review":"If you are looking for the history of Illinois from an everyday view then this book will be a great resource.

This book is unlike the contemporary garden design books by the same author. First, the book consists primarily of text, well written text, I grant you, but text never-the-less. The pictures are in black and white so if you are looking for a \\"coffee table book,\\" you need to search further. The author dose give us a wonderful history of European gardens, their concept, design, and present format. The black and white photos are quite good and are supplemented by wonderful line drawings and design patterns by Carol Moller, who is, by the way, quite good. For those interested in old, classical gardens from around the world you will find this a must have book for your collection. The text is clear and concise and quite readable. The book is broken down into parts. Part One is History. Part Two are Principles of Design. Part Three are Materials of Design. Part Four addresses Specialised Gardens. Then we have short chapters on wild gardents, rock gardens, factory gardens and school gardens.

It is scholarly yet very readable with actual footnotes vs. endnotes. It includes various women's roles: laywomen (mother, wife, etc.) & almswomen=nuns (Gurudhamma & Vinaya rules, Therigatha, etc.) & their interactions with each other, almsmen & laymen. It contains details of Buddhist women's lives, relations with Buddha, & the rules of Buddhist life, but IMHO most valuable are the author's astute & penetrating insights into the philosophy, etymology, & effects of early Buddhism on modern adherents--she is obviously well-versed in Buddhism. She also contributes to Buddhist biography esp. Ananda & Visakha (worthy of inclusion in biographical texts) & considerable material on other leading Buddhist women (e.g. Khema). Her main theses, supported with considerable evidence, address Buddhism & women's liberation in ancient India, attributing most negative views of women to later monk editors (p. 308: \\"The texts were written down, glossed & edited by men who had little historical sense & little sympathy with the doings of women\\"), making much of the differences between Pali texts as opposed to earlier English translations of flawed Sanskrit & Chinese (more misogynist in tone & content) & pp. xix-xx: \\"In the 1st place nothing was written down for at least 200 years, & probably more, after Gotama died...It is sometimes impossible to disentangle the original matter from later accretions.\\" In summary, p. 82: \\"The position of women in Buddhist India was more ennobled & more honorable than it had been in pre-Buddhist days...They enjoyed more independence, & a wider liberty to guide & follow their own lives\\" & p. 312: \\"Gotama's methods with women & the example he set to men must have been powerful forces in raising the status of women: a boon which they repaid by their large allegiance & manifold devotion.\\" More specifically, she presents discerning insights into: (1) monastic life: p. 214: \\"The entrants into the Buddhist Sangha did not and do not definitely bind themselves by vows to observe these [poverty, chastity, & obedience] major rules,\\" p. 217: \\"Lassitude & meaninglessness...do not appear to have been frequent in the Buddhist Order...may in part be attributed to a healthy mingling with the laity,\\" p. 324: \\"Monastic orders...originated with people who...had a genuine desire to leave the world...later members find that the demands made on them by renunciation are well-nigh intolerable: it then becomes necessary to increase external restrictions acting as guides, in the absence of spirituality, towards leading he good life,\\" p. 335: \\"This body of minute rules grew up as the almswomen tried to circumvent each one of them as it was made.\\" (2) relationships among types of adherents: pp. 253-4: \\"The determination of the laity to keep the recluses as different from themselves in as many respects as possible; & what the laity wished had usually the supremacy of a command. Without their goodwill the Order could not have been sustained.\\" & (3) Gotama's teachings: p. 107: \\"In his original teaching the simile of the Wheel had no place; the wheel symbol was introduced later,\\" pp. 221-2: \\"Renunciation sedulously pursued in the large matters will avenge itself by appearing in a multitude of trivial manifestations,\\" & pp. 374-5: \\"The irrational denial of the self that later became part of the monkish teaching...has often buried or distorted Gotama's real meaning & hence has done much to damage it by perpetuating false views on his teaching, quoting Buddha, \\"The whole world wide we traverse without thought & nothing find more dear to man than soul.\\""},{"Title":"A Sentimental Journey","review":"Laurence Sterne's 1768 novel, \\"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy,\\" is a strange and largely plotless book - less the recounting of a journey than of Parson Yorick's ramblings. Following the wildly successfuly, and no less diffuse \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" Sterne crafts a much smaller, but no less intense work, recounting the misadventures of Parson Yorick, himself a character in the earlier novel. Labelling himself a 'sentimental traveler,' Yorick's account of his travels is not descriptive, but emotive, revealing his conflicted, if warm-hearted psychology.The novel begins abruptly in the middle of a conversation between Yorick and his servant over a French policy in the eighteenth century of seizing the property of a foreigner who dies in France. Eager to discover the truth of the matter, Yorick impulsively throws a few shirts in a bag and before the next day ends, lands in Calais, France. Upon his arrival, his initial purpose, like many which he determines on in the course of the book, is forgotten, as his mind drifts from topic to topic as things and people happen to cross his sight. What remains of the novel are a series of pathetic and amorous adventures, in which Yorick's senses of morality, propriety, and common sense are brought into constant conflict with his impetuous nature and good humored guile.Sterne is too intelligent and expert a writer to allow sentiment, what we might call sappy nonsense, to rule the day in his novel, and the scrapes Yorick get himself into are as much a critique of pure sentiment as an exploration of the uses and practicality of human sympathy. Sterne is playing with a recent tradition of moral philosophy, including the likes of such authors as Shaftesbury and Adam Smith, the latter of whose \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" (1759) was at the forefront of popularizing and pragmatizing fellow-feeling. Sterne uses the excitable and impulsive Yorick to play with these ideas, along with those of his acquaintance, David Hume, whose notions of moral aesthetics marked a radical departure from the aforementioned predecessors. Out of all of these high flown philosophical traditions, Sterne fashions a witty and clever series of scenarios - from eating with peasants, bantering with a monk, flirting with a married woman while her husband indifferently watches, and nearly getting thrown in the Bastille - all display a very human look at the world.Encounters between Yorick and various classes and characters in France illustrate the distance between theory and practice in terms of implementing any kind of systematic philosophy - even, and especially for a man of the cloth, like our protagonist. Yorick means well most of the time, which makes his faults and foibles all the more endearing and amusing. By his own admission, Yorick is constantly falling in love, perhaps to give his bachelor life some sense of chivalric purpose, but when he starts falling in love with every chamber-maid and noblewoman in France, we begin to question, not only his sincerity, but the capacity of his sexual and emotional appetites. It makes for hilarious episodes, especially when his French servant, La Fleur, is dragged into the middle of them.A forerunner of the focused genre of sentimental fiction like Mackenzie's \\"The Man of Feeling\\" and the more refined imaginative sensibilities of many Romantic Era authors, Sterne's little novel, along with \\"Tristram Shandy\\" made immediate cultural impact, not only in England, but throughout Europe. Sometimes confusing, often amusing, reading Sterne's \\"Sentimental Journey\\" is a great way to while away a summer afternoon."},{"Title":"A Sentimental Journey","review":"I wish I could go around France and Italy and chat it up like this fellow does.I also wish I could write like him.

However, if the author had put more effort into introducing this word to the readers, it would make learning a lot more easier. I also suggest that the next edition include a CD Rom because it is very fun to study via multimedia presentation. The exercises in the book are adaquant, but there seems to be a lack of explanation.

Great volume!PIASA: In 1673, while voyaging down the Mississippi River, French explorers Marquette and Joliet, came across the petroglyph/painting of a strange creature up on the bluffs, high above the river in the area of Alton, Illinois. The beast, a conglomeration of bird, animal, reptile and fish characteristics, was sketched in Marquette's diary. The Illini Indians who lived there told them they had no idea who created it; in fact it had always been there. The Illini called the creature the Piasa, (Pie-a-saw) which in their language meant, \\"the bird that devoured men.\\" While the original creation was later destroyed by early settlers, the town has continued to paint an image of the Piasa on the bluffs along the river down to the present day.As Marquette's sketch was lost to history, no one is quite sure what the original petroglyph showed. The current image is based on an early settlers account. Many current images of the Piasa I believe have been significantly embellished to present a more sinister appearance. An early German painter, Henry Lewis, who travelled along the Mississippi inadvertently added to the mystery by painting an image of the Piasa in the background of a portrait of the locals. This image can be found by searching online or in the Minnesota Historical Society's out-of-print version of Lewis's, The Valley of the Mississippi Illustrated. The print, entitled The Piasa Rock is facing page 298.

It's mostly about Tarawa, or more specifically, Betio, which was part of a small chain of atolls in the Gilbert Islands. Originally designed as more or less a \\"practice\\" run on an easy target, it turned into an unholy mess.Hoyt is best when he deals with the personalities and the groups. The former have conflicts and the latter have social borders that must be defended, sometimes almost as tenaciously as the Japanese defenders fought on Tarawa. Hoyt doesn't spare the generals and admirals. Nimitz wanted the Pacific Theater to be a Navy show. Douglas MacArthur wanted it to be an Army show. Had Tarawa failed, as it seemed about to at one point, MacArthur would have had his way and the path to Japan would have been transformed.The groups involved in the planning and execution of the affair were the Navy, the Army, the Marine Corps, the Naval aviators, the carrier admirals, and the old black shoe battleship admirals. All of them were involved in one way or another in the attack. The Army never gets much credit in the Central Pacific but they fought on Makin Island while the Marines were on Tarawa. Marine General H. M. Smith thought the Army National Guard outfit under his command were a bunch of bunglers. But, among his men, General Holland M. Smith was known affectionately as \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Smith. Why any subordinate would feel affectionate towards a superior who was know for his ill temper has yet to be explained. In any case, each group seemed to feel they could win the war on their own. Of course, none of them could.In keeping with its brevity, the book doesn't go into much detail about the battles themselves. They lasted three or four days and cost 3,000 Marine casualties. Tarawa was a flat atoll surrounded by a coral reef. As is generally known, the tides were mistakenly judged to be high enough for ordinary landing craft to get over them and deliver the assault troops and equipment directly on the beaches. They weren't. The LCVPs were hung up on the reefs and many of the men had to leap overboard and wade ashore hundreds of yards through the lagoon through fierce and determined Japanese resistance.Tarawa is about one third the size of Central Park. So why didn't the elaborate naval bombardment and the attacks of bombers and fighters wipe out every Japanese defender? Because the Japanese weren't stupid, they were industrious, and they were excellent planners. They built numerous concrete pill boxes and machine gun emplacements with overlapping fields of fire -- and they fought to the last man. Here's how Hoyt describes the effects of the pre-invasion bombardment.\\"The naval guns and the air bombardment had not been nearly so effective against these strong fortifications as they had expected.\\" In Joseph Alexander's book on the subject, \\"Utmost Savagery\\", we learn more about the reasons why it didn't work as well as expected. Atolls like Tarawa and Wake Island are little more than necklaces of sand and coral with a few trees and shrubs. They're not high, volcanic islands like Samoa or Tahiti. They're almost flat. The highest point on an atoll is likely to be twenty feet above sea level. And atolls are never very big to begin with. Since they're so level and small they're easy to miss when fired at by big naval guns from far offshore, especially when hits raise clouds of dust and smoke. Alexander points out that some of the shells simply ricocheted off the land and finally exploded at sea or in the lagoon on the opposite side of the island. But Alexander's book is longer and more thorough in most ways than Hoyt's. He even provides a post-war study of the tides at Tarawa when examining the mistaken assumptions made by the planners.Hoyt's book shows a little evidence of haste but it's a decent book and seems even handed in every way. If it lacks the detail of Alexander's treatment, it's still fun to read about the feuds between the admirals and the generals, and you get more of it here than you do in Alexander."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"&quot;To reach truth is not to accumulate knowledge, but to awaken to the heart of reality.&quot; So starts a random chapter in Thich Nhat Hanh's now quite famous book ZEN KEYS. This book is FILLED to the brim with metaphors, allegories, and meditational suggestions Thich provides us with. He references Dogen a few times, using quotes of the old Master. Also interesting is Thich's use of some koans in the end of this work, something he is not &quot;well known for&quot; in many of his works. He provides us with 43 of them to be precise, with commentary following each one. It's just interesting because through the years Thay has seemed to lay off koan work some, yet this is a unique work in that he uses them.Simply put, this book will live up to your expectations if you read it through and through. Too often we place a book down during a &quot;slow part&quot;, never reading it's entirety. The most important facet of reading into Zen for me these days is approaching the texts with a &quot;I don't know it all&quot; mindset. A challenge, to say the least. After practicing and reading with teacher after teacher, group after group, sometimes you get the feeling you know something &quot;special&quot; about the Dharma. When we get this attitude, no book, no zazen, and no teacher can penetrate our ego. It is only when we become babies again that we can allow the light of truth to come back in. Get Thich's book, it's truly wonderful!Enjoy:)"},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"Thich Nhat Hahn uses his personal and direct writing style to do the impossible --- teach the basics of Zen to a western audience. This book is back in print after being unavailable for about twenty-five years. Consider yourself lucky. It is a very effective introduction to Zen, it doesn't dwell on the details and the author doesn't attempt to be mystical and astound you with how enlightened and &quot;zen-er than you&quot; he is. Thich Nhat Hahn tell it like it is. He is a very talented and gentle teacher and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Zen."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"Hardly a day goes by without a new Thich Nhat Hanh book - which is a very good thing. A Buddhist monk who fled the American War in Vietnam, Thich Nhat Hanh leads a world-wide community centered at Plum Village in south-west France. A critic and target of both the Communist regime and the U.S. backed South, he became well-known in America and a friend of Martin Luther King and Daniel Berrigan. Just as Chinese political oppression forced Tibetan Buddhists onto the world stage, Thich Nhat Hanh's exile allowed the West to come to know Zen better.\\"Zen Keys\\" is one of his earlier books and, unlike many others, is not a meditation text. \\"Zen Keys\\" is a serious introduction to the history and practice of Zen from the Buddha to the present. And Zen is practice. Unlike Western religions, Zen does not rely on dogma. Zen and Buddhism are methods of enlightenment, coming to know the real world. We have learned to \\"see\\" they world through reason and emotions. Reason and emotions are not bad; they are insufficient to come to know the world. \\"Reality, he writes, \\"is only reality when it is not grasped conceptually.\\" (112)Zen is the practice through which we come to know the world. Using some of Thich Nhat Hanh's books and other works, I have tried meditation. No, I have not attained enlightenment, but I have discovered all too many ways in which I have failed to see reality. Have I come to be a better human being because of \\"practice\\"? You'll have to ask someone else. And, yes, it is disconcerting - but so freeing - to realize that my idea of myself is a construct I've assembled over time and not who I am.As Thich Nhat Hanh points out, Zen and Buddhism do not lead to \\"navel-gazing\\". He is a proponent of engaged Buddhism, a modern term which reaches back to one of the oldest schools of Buddhism. He writes that in living in the world we have created, \\"What we lack is not an ideology or a doctrine that will save the world. What we lack is mindfulness of what we are, of what our situation really is.\\" (155)Take that, you Communists and Capitalists!"},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"I have a great respect for Thich Nhat Hanh and the many works that he has done in his years with us. This book is another example of his striving to present the joys of Zen to the western world. His poetry, charity, and daily life reflect a pattern of mindfulness that many will never experience. I fear though, as he states, that the Western world will not be able to fully grasp Oriental Zen practice, and a western form of it has arisen. I appreciate the book's simplicity, and honesty. May peace be with you today..."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"I purchased this book as a source of inspiration for my practice, however it turned out to be a summary of the Zen tradition from Vietnam. By all means it is a good book, just did not fit the current needs of my practice. Nevertheless, the 43 koans (translated to english for the first time by Thay) are a true piece of art, which make this book a good addition to any Zen practitioner's library.I feel the book \\"Meet the Real Dragon\\" by Gudo Wafu Nishijima goes deeper into the essence of Zen practice, and therefore into the essence of life itself."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"i had always had a semi-interest in buddhism, derived from ecstatic readings of 'dharma bums' by jack kerouac (another must-have), but disappointed as i couldnt find 'big sur' at the bookstore a month ago, i chanced upon the religion section, and zen keys shone out on the shelf, i picked it up, read a page of thich nhat hanh's contemplative prose, and immmediately bought and took it home devouring it in my bedroom for hours. Nhat Hanhs compassionate and understanding approach to Zen Buddhism makes learning about it easy, and also very rewarding. his take, which is no ones take at all but rather the truth, about zen makes for free-minded thinking thru the eight negations, mindfullness of everyday life, and the wisdom of the zen masters in the kung-ans at the end of the book. i cannot help but be forever changed by this simplistic yet beautiful overlay of Zen Buddhism. anyone, everyone, Americans and materialism and all, MUST read this, dont lose your life in forgetfullness and apathy and be lost in worldly pursuit, be a monk."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"Through a careful reading of this book may we return to our own path of prayerfulness in every thing we do.In ways it reads like Saint Benedict's Rule, or any earlier Catholic work on silent prayer in action. We return to realize what we are doing at every moment, with every gesture, and make that a prayer.This book need not deter us from our own traditional path, but make us stronger and more dedicated and serious and devote in our path and in our Faith. By this book we may even become better and more effective and true Christians.The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., himself a Nobel Peace Prize winner and practioner of prayerful nonviolence and love, nominated this author for the 1967 Nobel Peace. Jesuit Father Daniel Berrigan has swapped introductions for one another's prayer books with this author, including hisUncommon prayer: A book of Psalms. Therefore, we may all feel safe and secure in considering these indications within the context of our Faith, and gain a great edification from its prayerful practice.This book is wonderfully constructed with presentations and commentaries, as a helpful friend opening to us the secrets of otherwise inscrutable riddles, as a gentle friend drawing us back to awareness and sanity and sanctity in our chaotic and over-occupied world. This book returns us to realizing the mystery of practicing actual poverty as a means of making way for our opening awareness of God silently within our lives. This book returns us to the wonder of silent contemplation of the Divine presence, an ability we so easily forget as we look around and judge instead our neighbor and our clergy and what we wrongly percieve to be their wrongful actions at worship while we ignore our own busy and eager distraction from worshipful prayer.An interesting quote in this regard is found on page 27:\\"Precepts in Buddhism are not imposed by some outside authority. They arise from our own insight based on the practice of mindfulness. To be attached to the form without understanding the essence is to fall into what Buddhism calls attachment to rules. (p.27)\\"How much do we see this happening within our own Church where those who do not grasp the essence of God's commandments to practice compassion instead dwell nearly to the point of idolatry on minutiae of ritualistic liturgical practices empty of meaning, leaving no room for the action of the Holy Spirit of God's Love for us! Why not interchange those high fives at the Kiss of Peace if thus we more truly express our love and joy at meeting God in our neighbor? Why not sing those traditional hymns such as Kumbaya, which calls for the presence of God in our lives, if thus we grow more mindful of the Divine Presence immanent amongst us, as promised that where two or more are gathered in My Name, I am with you.This book restores us to such mindfulness, not only in meditation but within every mundane and physical action, including eating. By this book we become greater contemplatives, as awake as Carthusian monks fully mindful of every action as free from wordly distractions, making thus every action an intense prayer of love. This book can serve as portal back to a deeper realization of our own Faith in this world. Let this book re-open your eyes and ears to the presence of God, in peace, free of anger and distraction.Especially generous, not only the opening clarity and flowing explanations and commentaries which form the bulk of the book, but also the commentaries on the riddles near the end, which remind me of our Patristic tradition and the sayings (or apophthegmes) of the Desert Fathers. This book fills warmly a spot which yearns in our heart for a path back to the peace which is the center of our Faith tradition, a path now blocked by cries for \\"holy\\" war and division. Walk instead the way of peace, as once we all walked, together.Also available by this author isPeace Is Every Step-Meditation In Action: The Life and Work of Thich Nhat Hanhalong with any number of important books. Please do yourself and your busy, distracted, angry, sorrowful heart the great favor of finding this warm friend and good helper and wise and gentle counselor.Also interesting and helpful in this regard are the books of the Reverend Father Thomas Merton, Trappist monk and Catholic priest, in particular hisMystics and Zen Mastersand hisZen and the Birds of Appetite.which excellently draws the compatible parallels of Christianity with Buddhist prayer, as well as hisThe Asian Journal of Thomas Merton (New Directions Book). Father Merton, an excellent teacher in the monastic novitiate, serves uis as great teacher and spiritual master now and forever. Come home to God's peace through the mindful practice of compassion."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"I recommend that anyone interested in meditation, mindfulness and the place of these essential tools in personal development and for creating a more compassionate society should read this book.I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"Thich Nhat Hanh provides excellent background of Zen Buddhism as well as tips to live mindfully in today's society. A great book for a novice Zen Buddhist like myself."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"Zen Keys by Thich Nhat Hanh does a wonderful job of introducing the reader to the world of Zen, explaining ideas in easy to understand language that makes sense. You learn that Zen is not something external to seek - not a mysterious pearl that only seasoned gurus can get their hands on. Rather, Zen exists, fully, within every single person. That awakening is right there and is waiting to be found.The book can get a little heavy at times in names and history, but there will be some who appreciate all of that information.Thich explains that zen is about being mindful of every step, every action you take. It is not about hiding away in a monastery, necessarily - but rather about being fully engaged in every moment of your day. Where many people are caught up in a producing-consuming treadmill, we need to be comfortable with quite, calm, and just \\"being\\".I'm a little hesitant about Thich claiming that \\"Zen seems to be more authentic\\" than other religions, I would rather consider that there are multiple paths which can be equally authentic.There are a number of koans included in the book. Thich makes a point of explaining that koans are not a one-size-fits-all riddle that every person can decipher and figure out. Rather, koans were created for a specific person, in a specific time of their life. It's as if a football coach said to his quarterback \\"breathe the juice\\". For outsiders that might be complete nonsense. But if the coach and quarterback had talked about metaphors for years about how juice flows your body, and how juice is an energy which comes from a calm mind, and so on, this might be the perfect thing for the coach to say to him at this moment. It would NOT be the perfect thing for a piano coach to say to her student - she would choose her own metaphor and words to get her message across. So trying to \\"figure out\\" someone else's koan can be an exercise in futility.Still, it's always fun to read through koans, and I did have a favorite in the listing. It was:\\"Only the one who drinksknows exactly whetherthe drink is warm or cold.\\"Well recommended."},{"Title":"Zen keys","review":"This beautiful man is all peace.

Christoph Cardinal Schonborn is the general editor of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and might possibly become our next Pope. These reflections were actually preached for Pope John Paul II; you can't get more orthodox or reliable than that.The Catechism of the Catholic Church can be a heady book, very long, a bit technical for the layman. But it will spring to life for you in reading these spiritual exercises. This book taught me not just how to read the Catechism, but how to pray it.Cardinal Schonborn's great gift is the intense spirituality of his writing, which is deeply rooted in traditional Catholic theology and ancient Catholic scriptural exigesis. Christoph Schonborn will teach you to see the Church as she sees herself, as Bride, as victim, as the great cloud of witnesses which is the mystical Body of her Divine Spouse; in short you will see the Church as the communion of saints in Holy communion with the Lord. You will see the Church as Christ sees her--and if you're a convert, as I am, you will fall in love with her all over again."},{"Title":"Loving the Church: Spiritual Exercises Preached in the Presence of Pope John Paul II","review":"Knowledge makes love fruitful in service. God calls us to be the instruments of salvation for others(evangelization). That is the work of the Church. Far too many of us find ourselves involved in church work and not in the work of the Church. This little book will help straighten out the misunderstanding.&quot;Loving the Church&quot; is a series of meditations on the Church given as a Lenten retreat(1966) to the Holy Father and his staff.

Also, the main character is not a goody-goody, nor is he the typical bad [guy] anti-hero. Instead, he's just a normal guy who has been tormented for most of his life by images of the Tooth Fairy.This book was such an easy and captivating read that I finished it one day, and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing it on the big screen."},{"Title":"Darkness Falls","review":"When young Kyle Walsh loses his last baby tooth, you-know-who comes to retrieve it that night. But this is a very different tooth fairy from the one who came to you and I.

So instead of leaving Kyle a quarter under his pillow, she leaves him his mother's corpse and the murder rap to go with it.Twelve years later, Kyle has grown up into a deeply disturbed man, one addicted to anti-psychotics and who always stays in the light...he's tried to put the past behind him, but an urgent phone call from his old girlfriend brings him back to Darkness Falls to face his fears once and for all...Though Keith R.A. DeCandido's adaptation of the hit thriller doesn't quite match up to the movie in terms of tone, scares, or characterization, it is still a fun, fast book that has its share of high points and definitely makes you want to see the movie. One of the great things about this story is the protagonist, Kyle Walsh, a fully realized and empathetic man of flesh and blood who has lived his whole life in the shadows and struggles to break free. Also, \\"Darkness Falls\\" manages to avoid many of the horror genre's typical cliches--though the novelization does succumb to pattern a bit more frequently than the film.

Therefore, I will feel somewhat unclear about applying the theory after reading. It is good to start with this book..."},{"Title":"Data Analysis Tools for DNA Microarrays","review":"The targeted audience of this book is biologists who are eager to get an understanding of the analysis tools they use for microarrays. The book does an excellent job addressing this tier of audience.The book has plenty of examples. Almost all the examples, whether fake or real, are microarray-related. Whenever needed, figures or charts are provided to illustrate ideas. A few chapters that introduce basic statistical concepts provide solved problems and exercises. All these efforts are worthwhile making difficult statistical concepts easy to understand in the context of microarrays and making the book especially valuable for biologists who do not have strong background in statistics.This book has an emphasis on major statistical aspects of microarray data analysis. There are 17 chapters in this book. About 8 of them are directly related to statistics. Especially, there is one whole chapter devoted to multiple hypothesis testing, one chapter for ANOVA, and one chapter for experimental design. The above subjects are presented in a thorough, yet easy-to-follow style. Statistical issues are often not well addressed in published papers using microarrays. This book on microarray data analysis does an excellent job emphasizing this aspect.The title of the book indicates \\"data analysis\\". However, since this is not a clearly defined term, you should be aware that the book only deals with \\"the bare minimum\\" of data analysis. That is routines, such as normalization, transformation, statistical testing, and clustering, that have to be carried out each and every time. Exploratory data visualizing and data mining algorithms are not covered thoroughly in this book. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) is presented as a subsection of a chapter. It does not provide explanations on concepts such as loading factors nor scree test. Series data (e.g. time series) are on two pages only and there is no mention of Fourier transformation. Support vector machine (SVM), which is widely used today as a supervised classification method, is not presented at all.As I mentioned at the beginning, the targeted audience is biologists. If you are a statistician or a bioinformatician who wants to mathematically explore data analysis algorithms, you should look somewhere else. You may be disappointed that many concepts are not rigorously or accurately defined in this book. For example, the book uses capital letters to denote random variables. But the concept of random variables is not rigorously defined in the book. One of the consequences is the weak definition of mathematical expectation. Another example is the inflation of Type I error rate. On page 220, the author claims that the probability of \\"drawing the correct conclusion\\" is 1 - p, where p is the calculated probability of a statistic versus a parameter. However, if the probability of making a correct conclusion excludes the probability of making Type II errors, 1 - p should be stated as the probability of not making Type I errors.In summary, this is a good book on microarray analysis tools for biologists using microarrays. However, people who are seeking in-depth descriptions of these algorithms should look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Data Analysis Tools for DNA Microarrays","review":"I'm more than 2/3 through the book and I've never encountered a topic that I feel could have been better presented.

After six months working with this technique and reading chapters on all the books I've bought I can say with certainty that Draghici's is the best introductory book on microarrays. Other books around are better at describing protocols or explaining the math involved in microarray data analysis but Draghici's book does a very good job at explaining how to analyse microarray data for the biologist (and maybe for other publics but statisticians). Everytime some friend ask me for hints on chapters or books to read for learning (or re-learning) statistics I suggest this book. The first chapters are an excellent review of the basics of statistics necessary for day to day practice. The only complain I have is that the shareware software that comes with the book does not work anymore (it's trial period has already expired and therefore it is not possible to install it even if you get a brand new book).

It is definitely very useful, I recommend."},{"Title":"Data Analysis Tools for DNA Microarrays","review":"I have entered the area of microarray data analysis three years ago, having an engineering/machine learning background which includes good knowledge of statistics. After reading many journal papers about particular algorithms for microarray data analysis, I felt the need to read a book so that I could get the big picture of the field. At the beginning I was skeptical about reading Draghici's book because it was recommended to me as \\"excellent\\" by a biologist. I was pretty sure that given my background I will get bored of it quickly. My intuition failed me in this case because after reading it, I found it too as being far from ordinary, and answering my needs as well.The book is an easy-to-follow introduction to the area of microarray data analysis covering areas from image analysis and preprocessing, to differential expression, clustering, and high level analysis such as ontological analysis. The book is particularly useful in underlying common pitfalls with microarray data. Examples include failing to correct for multiple testing in microarray experiments and the misuse or overuse of the clustering algorithms. Abounding examples and clear illustration are given to support every single aspect treated in the text. In my opinion, graduate level students in biology, bioinformatics and statistics can greatly benefit from the lecture of this book.Another positive aspect is the fact that, with the exception of one chapter about the available commercial software, this book was written by just one author. This gives a continuity of ideas and a consistency of notations and terms throughout the entire book. This is usually not found in many other books on this topic as they are sometimes just edited collections of chapters written independently by different authors (see for instance the text by Berrar et. al which has about 40 contributors).A great incentive for me in writing this review was reading an overzealous critique to this book, written by Eric Wu in this webpage. I found some of his comments to be particularly misleading and out of context. For instance he says \\"the book only deals with the bare minimum of data analysis\\". Compared with other books in the field, the topics about data analysis covered in the book are not only more numerous but much more thoroughly explained. This book does not expedite the reader to some references but cares about explaining the things. If this book is the \\"bare minimum\\" at 500 pages, how is Mr. Wu going to characterize the other well known books in the field such as Knudsen, Simon, Speed, Baldi, etc. which have at most half as many as this book has. Knudsen, for instance, takes the reader from absolute measurements to and including ANOVA in 17 pages. Draghici covers the same topics in 7 chapters or about 250 pages, and that would be without counting the chapters on the basic statistics or image analysis. Another example of biased assessment is when Mr. Wu says \\"Exploratory data visualizing and data mining algorithms are not covered thoroughly in this book. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) is presented as a subsection of a chapter.\\" The PCA description in the book is more than just fine to me. The book is not supposed to be an encyclopedia of statistics. What the reader needs to know is how PCA can help with the visualization of these multidimensional data sets and not necessarily give all the details about PCA.A last example I give of superficial judgment in Mr. Wu's view is the so called \\"inflation of Type I error rate\\". Mr. Wu says: \\"... if the probability of making a correct conclusion excludes the probability of making Type II errors, 1 - p should be stated as the probability of not making Type I errors\\".. In general, this statement would be true. However, the paragraph from the book to which Mr. Wu is referring to actually starts by saying: \\"When the t statistic for a gene is more extreme than the threshold...\\" etc. If the observed statistic is more extreme than the threshold, the statistical reasoning requires us to reject the null hypothesis. In this case type II errors (false negatives) CANNOT occur. Hence, in this case, the probability of drawing the correct conclusion is indeed 1-p, exactly as stated in the book.Overall, I find that the value you get per dollar spent when buying this book is high, and thereby I would strongly recommend it.Dr. Adi L. Tarca, Windsor (CANADA)"},{"Title":"Data Analysis Tools for DNA Microarrays","review":"When entering the minefields of microarray data analysis, one has to understand and keep up with state-of-the-art technologies and interdisciplinary literatures. A background in molecular biology is clearly not enough to evaluate the pro and cons of the various statistical methods for selecting truly modulated candidate genes in a given experimental biological system. Choosing between the available analysis software's is not an easy task either. Draghici presents a complete visit of the microarray underworld by initiating the reader to all the facettes of this domain. From the fundamentals of slide production and target hybridization to image processing, statistical analysis, experimental design, data management and biological interpretation, all aspects treated herein are described with pertinent details. Draghici slowly, but successfully, tames the reticent molecular biologist to the arid world of statistics and even entertains the reader with anecdotes and humoristic citations.Clearly written, with appropriate mathematical examples for each topic, this book even includes exercises at the end of some chapters, for the zealous student sleeping in all of us. It constitutes a very good didactic tool and the included CD's allow a good peek in some of the available image/data analysis software's on the market.As a core facility manager and eternal student, I strongly recommend Draghici's book to life scientists and students who are struggling with statistical analysis and data mining techniques.Brigitte Malette, Ph.

The series balances heavy drama and sharp wit, larger-than-life heroes and fully realized characters. The razor-sharp writing is complimented by the stylized, cartoonish art and drab colors. These are creators in full control of their art form.Storywise, \\"Roleplay\\" brings the concept of heroes down to the level of impressionable college students.

I happened across this book in a bookstore earlier this year (2002), though, and was stunned.This comic had interesting characters, good dialog and a great setting. The plot isn't anything new (tracking down a serial killer) but it is executed well in this setting.The two main characters, Detectives Pilgrim and Walker, are normal humans who investigate crimes related to \\"Powers\\" (superhumans). The focus here is more on the crime and the characters than it is on powers and special effects. This is what makes the comic so good. Instead of 10 pages of laser beams and force fields, you get dialog, characterization and story. Sure, there are superhumans around, but they are more background than focus.So, if you stopped reading comics because everything seemed the same, give this one a shot.

I learned that this was the second volume and that I needed to find out what had happened before. Thankfully, Wikipedia exists, so I was quickly able to catch up. I have to say, this series is a realistic look at how society would most likely deal with superheroes. They would, of course, be viewed with some stigmatism by the non-powered members of society.

The cover has Christian Walker's costume from his superhero days and I suppose that would be shocking in a deceptive way to people who were reading the series then but I have seen Walker established as a cop first and a former superhero second (with some weird developments beginning with Cosmic) so it didn't have much impact on me.The storyline is cool.

However, we quickly learn that it is illegal for someone without powers to wear costumes or impersonate existing heroes. Although the reasons for this law are never explicitly stated, it is a fair bet that (1) doing so puts \\"normal\\" humans at risk due to high levels of supervillains, and (2) we begin to get clues that powers-humans relations aren't that good (a sign in the lobby of an apartment complex states that the landlord doesn't rent to powers).As Walker and Pilgrim try to find the supervillain responsible for the kids' deaths, the pair have to deal with ex-villain collaborators and the city's underworld, which only complicates things in our modern age of litigation.Overall, Roleplay wasn't as strong a story as Who Killed Retro Girl, but it was still interesting and whoed us a more \\"everyday\\" case that Walker and Pilgrim deal with.

In the original Image comics, Bendis shows open contempt for &quot;regular&quot; comic book fans; his letter columns (not reprinted in this volume) contain nasty and scatological replies to gushing fans who idolize his work.

The comparison that is most easily drawn is to Kafka's, \\"The Trial\\". While this may be the easiest parallel to draw it suggests this is just a variation on a theme and that would be a disservice to this book and the author.The unnamed narrator first petitions a committee. This group is made of members we are told virtually nothing about. Our narrator only makes vague references to what a positive decision from this committee would mean to him. Whatever his goal, it must be of great value for during his first audience he is not only queried on his knowledge, his is degraded, pointlessly degraded. The similarities to other writings remain in regard to arbitrary and absolute authority; together with the perversions of thought and justice they produce. Unlike, \\"The Trial\\", there is no evidence he stands accused of anything on his initial hearing. The committee after a long delay sets for him yet another task, and when they learn of how he proceeds despite the blockades put before him, the group visits him, with a single member remaining. This shadow is the same individual who so crudely humiliated him before. The treatment again begins with the total invasion of everything that is held private for the individual, with the result that our narrator commits a crime, comes once again before the committee, and receives a surreal sentence.Throughout this fairly brief work the narrator in his appearances before the group, and in his private thoughts often expounds on his theories with seemingly bizarre examples. What becomes bizarre is that in their way his arguments make sense, and this is after Coca-Cola, peanut farming, cigarettes, anti-depressants, and presidential elections explain his thoughts.The sentence our anti-hero receives is described by the publisher as a new realm of satiric surrealism. Whether satiric or satanic, the ending is not one you will forget, and you may likely be drawn to read the work of other writers who wanted their subjects to stand firmly in existential space."},{"Title":"The Committee (Middle East Literature in Translation)","review":"First off, a caveat: The editorial reviews (above) for this fine, provocative novel do the disservice of revealing its entire story like Cliff Notes. Best to avoid reading them if you prefer the pleasure of discovering a novel's storyline as it's revealed by the author.In its 166 pages, this short novel has a lot on its mind. Readers eager to defend the benefits of unchecked globalization will no doubt take offense at the critique of its impact on lesser developed countries, including Egypt and the rest of the Arab world as represented here by Sun\`Allah Ibrahim. Meanwhile, its vision of the individual overwhelmed by social and political forces beyond his understanding applies anywhere dissent is suppressed and might makes right, which can happen even in self-proclaimed \\"free\\" societies.There is plenty of Kafka and some Orwell in these pages, and the narrator's sardonic point of view owes much surely to the author's experience as a political prisoner during the tumultuous years of revolution in his home country. One does not suffer physically and psychologically for one's ideals and look respectfully at those whose chief objectives have been to amass power and wealth at the expense of others. Readers of any political persuasion should find the ironies at the center of this book a thought-provoking challenge to whatever they believe about what it means to be an individual in a binary world where people increasingly show up as survey results, digits on spreadsheets, and numbers in headlines."},{"Title":"The Committee (Middle East Literature in Translation)","review":"Written from 1979-81, this short novel invites immediate comparison to Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;. In it, an unnamed man is summoned to appear before a mysterious and apparently powerful committee who will apparently judge him in some way-although what this actually means is left unexplained. The first theme of the tale emerges when the committee asks him, &quot;By which momentous event among the wars, revolutions, or inventions will our century be remembered in the future?&quot; This results in a lecture on globalism (remember this was written over 20 years ago) via a capsule history of Coca-Cola and its proliferation across the world in the years after WWII. The second theme comes forth when the committee directs him to write &quot;a study on the greatest contemporary Arab luminary.&quot; This drives him to research a powerful and mysterious man known simply as &quot;the Doctor,&quot; a man with fingers in every conceivable pie. Given the timing of the writing, one could well read &quot;the Doctor&quot; as representing Sadat's &quot;open-door&quot; economic policies and the entire book as a satirical attack on those policies and the figures behind them. Despite the censorious obstacles in his path, the narrator manages to start uncovering nuggets of truth about &quot;the Doctor.&quot; Unsurprisingly, this angers the committee and he is commanded to pick another subject which leads to a surreal (and satirical) climax."},{"Title":"The Committee (Middle East Literature in Translation)","review":"The comparison to Franz Kafka?s ?The Trial? is obvious. An anonymous court sitting in judgment about a crime they will not divulge. The accused not knowing what is expected of him. A verdict that is never spelled out.The author aims his negative comments at the globalization of trade, takes dead aim at the United States, and skewers Coca Cola. This is a cheap shot by Mr. Ibrahim who received part of his education in communist Russia and tries to put a modern literary frame around his prejudices."},{"Title":"First among Equals: Abraham Lincoln's Reputation During His Administration (North's Civil War)","review":"This book will be of interest only to people who desire information on President Lincoln's reputation just before and during his terms in office. It is not a general history of the man or the era. Professor Trefousse's aim is to give a multitude of specific quotes from the time extolling President Lincoln to rebut the supposed thought he was almost universally disparaged before his assasination lifted him to martyrdom. To me, it is a book on which most avid readers about Abraham Lincoln can afford to give a pass."},{"Title":"Aviation and Airport Security: Terrorism and Safety Concerns","review":"This is an interesting and informative book on aviation and airport security. The book describes terrorism and provides a historical perspective to the terrorism menace. It critically examines the post 11 September 2001 legislation in the USA and its effectiveness in combating and preventing terrorist attacks in the aviation industry.I found the book to be instructive. It systematically covers the issues of interest to those involved in aviation security. It is an important reference book for me as my job involves aviation security matters. It contains a wealth of information including some of the latest technologies and techniques that are critical to thwart terrorist attacks. The various security risks are identified as well as the different methods of managing and mitigating them.If you are involved in aviation or airport security in one way or the other or you have an interest in becoming involved in the future, this book will provide you the information you need in a readable, enlightening, accessible and comprehensive manner."},{"Title":"Aviation and Airport Security: Terrorism and Safety Concerns","review":"I found this book to be very helpful and informative. It was written more like a text book, very factual, rather than the authors opinion.

Moses of Georgia: Autobiography of an unreconstructed Southerner","review":"A book that truly needs reprinting. Moses was highly capable and intelligent quartermaster for Longstreet's corps whose skills even managed to feed the corps during the east Tennessee campaign in 1864. A practicing Jew,, Moses was unique in his heritage on a highly capable staff. Although I do not have the book, I remember an excellent description of Longstreet's staff inhabiting VP Andrew Jackson's home and found a looked chest. Excited thinking it contained Jackson's riches, it was opened with anticipation only to find scrap of foolscap, with Jackson's scrawled signature. The future President was initially illiterate and the foolscap was his practice paper. The books I highly descriptive and entertaining. Morningside books used to have copies."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"This has got to be the best book I've ever read. It's an absolute masterpiece. If you don't already own this book, you really must pick it up. It's a classic of classics and continues to be controversial even to this day.Renan presents us with a brilliant biography of Jesus, but one in which he's a mere man, not a god. He paints us a picture of a talented and wise man who gets caught up in the fervor he creates and provides us with logical explanations for the \\"miracles\\" that were said to surround him. This book created an enormous stir at the time it was written and still ruffles feathers even now.Renan certainly treads on sacred cows, but they are cows that deserve to be treaded upon. Of all the divisive factors, religion has been the main and most persistent one. Religion has greatly hampered the advancement of humanity and caused a great deal of suffering, privation, and death. It also kept women oppressed for millennia, and we are still working to undo that damage. It's only been in the past century that great strides have been made to improve the lot of women, and I believe that religion has been the main culprit to blame for the inequities that women have faced for so long.This book is a body blow to traditional Christian dogma and a supremely original work. It's a definite must-read."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"There are some books that everyone should read, and this is one of them. The idea was so fresh, and controversial, for its time and remains intriguing to this day. Renan was a brilliant and courageous man who dared to do what no one else had done before. He insisted on writing an unthinkable biography on Jesus, treating him like any other man, and critiquing the Bible like any other book. Naturally, a firestorm ensued. The book still causes firestorms today, but it also has been very influential. It's been an important steppingstone that's inspired other works, though I believe Renan's work is the best of them all. The original always is. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"Ernest Renan (1823-1892) was a French philosopher and writer, who was best known for this 1863 book. The book presents a very (some would say \\"excessively\\") \\"emotional\\" telling of the life of Jesus (remember that it was written at the height of the \\"Romantic\\" era in literature), and it became a best-seller in France.The book was intended as the first book of a history of the origin of Christianity, of which this volume \\"treats of the particular fact which has served as the starting-point of the new religion, and is entirely filled by the sublime person of the Founder.\\"As an example of the \\"emotional\\" character of his writing, here is a scene from the crucifixion: \\"The sky was dark, and the earth, as in all the environs of Jerusalem, dry and gloomy. For a moment, according to certain narratives, his heart failed him; a cloud hid from him the face of his Father; he endured an agony of despair a thousand times more acute than all his torture.\\"Here are some other representative quotations from the book:\\"That the Gospels are in part legendary, is evident, since they are full of miracles and of the supernatural; but legends have not all the same value.\\"\\"I beg those who think that I have placed an exaggerated confidence in narratives in great part legendary ... To what would the life of Alexander be reduced if it were confined to that which is materially certain?\\"\\"We do not say, 'Miracles are impossible.' We say, 'Up to this time a miracle has never been proved.'\\"\\"Jesus despised all religion which was not of the heart ... We should seek in vain in the Gospel for one religious rite recommended by Jesus.\\"Although stylistically much different from how we would write today, this influential book remains a crucial book for students of the historical Jesus, biblical criticism, and the early Christian church."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"Humanity has spent far too long hobbling on the crutch of religion, and it's long past time for us to cast that crutch aside and run free. Religion has bridled too many minds and bound too many hands. How much longer will humanity remain crippled by it? How much longer will we continue to point fingers at others, harm each other, and limit ourselves in the name of a god? This is the 21st century. We're only just beginning to see the wonders we can achieve (and might have achieved ages ago if religious leaders hadn't kept insisting that the world was flat and viciously persecuting anyone who decreed otherwise).Renan was cruelly persecuted for penning his masterwork on the life of Jesus as a mere man. Now that we live in more enlightened times, it's easy to forget what a fearsome and powerful adversary the church used to be and how ruthlessly it dealt with anyone who crossed it.I strongly recommend this book. It's wonderfully thought provoking, and the author wrote it at great risk to himself."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"This is one of the very first attempts at a real Jesus, one who speaks to us through himself, and not through one of the many churches who shout his name...thereby drowning all thought. It's superbly written by a leading Hebrew scholar of his day. I gave it five stars for two reasons. One. To try to reflect its worth more accurately than the above review. Two. It bloody deserves it."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"Renan was thrown out of the \\"Coll&egrave;ge de France\\" for having written that Jesus was an extraordinary man. He is THE, or at least one of the most important founders of the secular interpretation of Jesus, amazingly derived essentially from John's Gospel rather than from the Synoptics. His book is an important landmark to have, if not on our bookshelves, at least in our memories. For the happy few, it's easier as always to read in the original French rather than the translated version. Writing styles have also considerably changed since the romantic literature era. And many ideas and discoveries have been made since Renan's mid-nineteenth century days and he would have loved all the material disclosed a hundred years later by the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library as well as all the archaeology related in the \\"Bible Unearthed\\". The book may seem a bit outdated today, but what insight and intellectual courage!Aware of many unresolved problems, Renan prophesized that the correct interpretation of the bible would come from a layman using a critical approach and is devoid of any desire to destroy the dogma or to protect it. If we follow his recommendations, we have to look for someone who wants to discover the real meaning (I'm sure that the Jesus of the Gospels is just as alien to Church readings as to scholarly revisions) of these ancient texts and who is neither a Christian apologist nor an already convinced atheist. Who will square the circle?"},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"I believe this book should be on every intellectual's shelf.

It's wonderfully thought provoking, and the author wrote it at great risk to himself."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"Renan was a Frenchman who had spent a considerable time in Palestine. He attempted to write a life of Christ based not on the perspective that he was God but rather a man. This consists of trying to put what happened in the context of Jewish and Roman Society at the begining of the Christian era.He portrays Jesus as a spiritual leader who rejected orthodox judiasm and was killed by conservative believers who felt the order of their religion was threatened. He explains some of the miracles by coming up with mundane explanations. Thus Lazarus might have been simply sick rather than dead.Historically the book was of importance in developing a secular understanding of the Gospels. However it is now out of date as many more questions have been raised about the content and consistency of the gospels and what appears to be historical and mythical in the life of Jesus. The book is reasonably easy to read but is written in a archaic style that does not read easily today and it also is reflective of descriptions of Jewish people that would now be seen as racist."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus (The Thinker's library)","review":"This book is recommended by conservative Christian teacher, the late Dr. J. Vernon McGee, in his 5-year program called \\"Through the Bible.\\" This free online and radio program is a verse-by-verse journey through the entire Bible in 5 years. From humble beginnings, the program is now broadcast in over 100 languages and dialects, all over the world. The program is beginning again as I write this review and Renan is recognized as a brilliant author. Here is a quote from Dr. McGee:\\"Renan, the French skeptic, made an attack on the Word of God, as you know; yet he wrote a \\"Life of Christ.\\" His book is divided into two sections, one is the historical section, the other is the interpretation of the life of Christ. As far as the first part is concerned, there probably has never been a more brilliant life of Christ written by any man. But his interpretation of it is positively absurd. It could have been done better by a twelve-year-old Sunday school boy. What is the explanation of that? Well, the Spirit of God does not teach you history or give you facts that you can dig out for yourself; a very clever mind can dig out those. But the interpretation is altogether different. The Spirit of God has to do the interpreting, and He alone must be the Teacher to lead us and guide us into all truth. We must have the Spirit of God to open our eyes to see.\\""},{"Title":"Why Do Parakeets Do That?: Real Answers to the Curious Things Parakeets Do","review":"If you've ever had a bird, you know they can be, well, odd birds!

Ten artists--most in their early thirties--are profiled, and I would, figuratively speaking of course, kill to have the work of any hanging on my walls. As Ivan Vartanian, who has put this book together, notes in his introduction, most of the art reflects the so-called \\"super-flat\\" style that is all the rage among Japan's cutting-edge artists. This two-dimensional graphic style is associated with Japanese manga (adult comics) and anime (animated films), and in a number of cases the renderings of female faces here owe a great deal to the childlike, wide-eyed models of manga and anime. Another recurring theme in this art is the emphasis on animals. One artist, for example, repeatedly uses elephants as her theme with a style that resembles a cross between Hello Kitty and Babar. In large part it is this prevalence of lovable animals, child-like faces, and various dream-like themes that has led Vartanian and others to label the work of these artists \\"kawaii,\\" the Japanese word for cute.Personally I would be more inclined to apply the word \\"kowai,\\" which means \\"frightening\\" in Japanese, to the work presented in \\"Drop Dead Cute.\\" There is an overwhelming sense of loneliness and alienation in this graphic work, a general absence of men and of family life, all sorts of female grotesqueries, and juxtapositions of the horrific and the idyllic. Take, for example, the graphically-stunning work of Chiho Aoshima. In one print she has what is perhaps the most beautiful rendering of a Japanese plum tree that I have ever seen, and this tree in blossom is mixed with images of the mythical paradise of Mount Horai. Stranded in the high branches of the tree, meanwhile, is a naked woman bound in ropes. Another artist, Tabaimo, who works in a take-off of the ukiyoe style, has a subway car scene with a baby abandoned like a package on an upper luggage rack, a stack of dismembered forearms, and a man wrapped like a piece of sushi.What this all means is only touched on lightly by Vartanian. He has provided a mere one page of text by way of understanding each artist, and his introduction is also just a teaser in hinting at the darker side of this art. For a fuller understanding of how an emphasis on childish themes is coexisting with a sense of alienation in Japan today, the reader of \\"Drop Dead Cute\\" would do well to acquire the more scholarly and probing \\"Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture.\\""},{"Title":"Drop Dead Cute","review":"There is very little text in this book.. it is mainly a coffee table book. The essay is by Ivan Vartanian, who I've never heard of and is not really an academic author or scholar. I found it to be a somewhat shallow and somewhat stereotypical discussion of the artists included. The entries for each artist were also very brief. The images, however speak for themselves, and there are quite a few in this slender book. They included several full-color full-page comics by Aya Takano for example. The images are not really \\"definitive\\" and they should be supplemental to other reproductions of the artists' works."},{"Title":"Drop Dead Cute","review":"I really enjoyed the diversity of styles presented.

I've shown it to some fine artists, who seemed to appreciate it more, but as an illustrator and a long time fan of japanese art, I was dissapointed.There is one artist in the book who does flat, local color for terribly simple animal paintings. Nothing engaging, interesting, or different about a brown rabbit sitting. I would have done that in highschool.The cover image comes from a comic artist inside. Once again, local color and nothing very engaging. Just boring and wierd.Some of the other artists seemed like it was directed towards kids because it was drawn in the shaky, unpolished manner of a child's hand. They were also more symbolic drawings that children do of people, homes, the sun, and trees.There are a few artist that are actually interesting. One uses the computer to be extremely decorative. It's not the best, but it is definitely capable of being excellent and is very interesting to look at.In my opinion though, there are only three artist that I really enjoyed. I do not like the book very much and have cut it up to use in projects. That tore me inside, to cut up a book, but it was there for the project and I was finding a lot of things I didn't mind tearing out. The cute art was not very adorable to me and I suggest buying it used if you must have it. It's not worth the money originally priced or discounted."},{"Title":"Online Communities: Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability","review":"I turned to this book looking for (a) ideas to improve my own online community (photo.net), and (b) ideas to teach to my students at MIT. I was disappointed on both counts. Preece has a long section on online education but misses a main advantage: new opportunities for people to teach (the offline world already has a lot of opportunities for learning at any time of day or night). Preece talks about what she calls &quot;technology&quot;. The mention of VRML in a book published in 2000 will please nostalgia buffs. But there is no discussion of the role of the relational database management system. Preece uncritically quotes various scholars of the female experience online, dwelling on the alleged fact that revealing oneself to be a woman is a passport to ill treatment (in fact, our experience on photo.net is that women who ask questions are answered more promptly and treated more gently if they violate community norms such as &quot;search before you post&quot;).You'll learn a lot more from surfing the Web site of Amitai Etzioni, the world's leading offline communitarian sociologist, than from reading this book."},{"Title":"Online Communities: Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability","review":"This extremely well documented book brings readers up to date with all we know about online communities (except for their economics). Preece's concept of community-centered design takes a big step toward bringing systemization and structure to the free wheeling world of online development. Business people will find many helpful &quot;how to&quot; guides, techniques and examples for community needs analysis, design, testing, monitoring and evaluation. Academics will relish her study documentation, references, articulation of continuing issues and recommendations for further reading. Students can learn much from the well documented case studies of several different online community applications."},{"Title":"Online Communities: Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability","review":"I thought this book was GREAT! Sure, it's dated, but every book about the Internet dates quickly. That's because the Internet is growing and changing faster than the book publishing business can publish a book.The author takes us through many aspects of community building and group dynamics point-by-point. I had to take notes, I found it so useful. Ideas are taken from sociology and applied to the Internet. Dry in parts, yes, but very useful as far as clarifying one's ideas about online communities.As the manager of a small women's community online, I found this book very useful. Much more practical than Amy Jo Kim's similar book, which mainly focuses on the monster-sized for-profit communities.The ideas in this book can be applied to any size online community. It's clear thinking will help you understand participant/leader roles in order to delegate responsibility. There are also wonderful hints for keeping a community thriving and successful."},{"Title":"Online Communities: Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability","review":"As a graduate student in HCI, I found this book to be a travesty. The author did not do her homework when preparing this text, many of her statements were either dated or just incorrect. Professor Preece also has a tendancy for making broad sweeping statements that are for the most part unsupported and questionable.This does not mean the text is completely without use. As a framework for a text on online communities the design of the book is good. Several of the further readings are also worthy of examination.The text is recommended for graduate use. It is much more appropriate for the advanced high school or an introduction to online communites at the undergraduate level.I believe there can and will be a book on online communities with substance and meaning. This book is not it."},{"Title":"Online Communities: Designing Usability and Supporting Sociability","review":"Jenny Preece's book thoughtfully links social interaction with interface design. Too many online ghost towns result from those who don't grasp the linkage and the importance of both aspects. Online community developers need to be aware of the impact of interface decisions, such as the simplicity of the login process or the ease in searching for background info on participants, on the effectiveness of a medical support group.This book also builds an important bridge between theory and practice. For example, network theory from sociology suggests who should be participants in an online community and common ground theory from psychology is linked to interface design decisions.While some wide-eyed technology promoters believe that immersive environments are the ultimate goal, Jenny Preece makes a compelling case that asynchronous environments can produce higher levels of engagement and empathic support.Her broad review with references are thorough and help readers see the emergence of a new discipline.

Her section on community-centred development is a key part of the book along with her emphasis on usability and sociability. These concepts, especially that of sociability, offer her continuing research results to beginners and longer-term researchers and developers. The book is comprehensive in the way it covers many important topics. It is valuable for designers and developers and also offers considerable resource material though its web site. Use it! I already use Jenny Preece's book (written with others) on Human-Computer Interaction for teaching that subject. Her new book extends her support for the design and academic community in a significant way.

Many important studies and discussions of online communities exist and there is a good body of CSCW literature related to building systems for collaboration, but Preece focuses on principles and practices of usability of emerging systems. This is new ground and brings the perspective of usability engineering to the social issues of electronic communication. In addiiton to defining this intersection as a subfield of HCI/CSCW, there are practical suggestions for users and desigers alike.

This book explains this and more. However, if you are looking for a simple overview of what a facilitator should, could and would do incertain situations, this is NOT your book. If you are a manager trying to be a better facilitator, do not buy this book unless you want in-depth information.That said, if you are a facilitator looking to improve your skills, combine theory and practice or simply go back to the basics of what makes some facilitators great, this is your book.Also, if you are a manager who really wants to become an effective facilitator/mentor, this is your book. But don't think that you can simply read the material and be more effective. The ideas and theory will take practice. Luckily, the book also gives many examples to make the ideas and theories practical and concrete.As I said, I bought it to become better at selling professional facilitation.

I submitted my request to GRP-FACL@listserv.albany.edu, which, as far as I know, is the largest online discussion forum for active, professional facilitators. Roger Schwartz's book, &quot;The Skilled Facilitator&quot; was by far the favorite choice of people in the profession. I am ordering my copy now!"},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"The subtitle of this accessible guide to facilitation, \\"Practical Wisdom For Developing Effective Groups\\", accurately describes the book's scope and utility. In four parts and thirteen chapters, Schwarz provides an overview, with countless meaningful examples, of how facilitators can most effectively help groups develop their capacity for improvement. He distinguishes between two types of facilitation: (1) Basic facilitation, which aims to help a group \\"solve a substantive problem\\"; and (2) Developmental facilitation, which accomplishes basic facilitation while helping a group learn \\"to improve its process\\". He argues that three core values underlie effective group and facilitator behavior. The first is \\"valid information\\", which means that relevant information is shared by group members and that all groups members can validate and understand the information. The second is \\"free and informed choice\\", which means that group members define their own goals and methods of achieving those goals using valid information. The third is, \\"internal commitment to the choice\\", which means that group members take responsibility for their decisions by making informed choices based on valid information. Using a basic or developmental approach, facilitators most effectively intervene by making explicit and modeling these core values. These values are maintained by a group agreeing and sticking to essential ground rules, which Schwarz lists on p. 75 and treats extensively throughout the book.In the heart of Schwarz's book are seven chapters on intervening effectively in groups. In those chapters, he advises the reader on, among other things, how to intervene, meeting management, group problem-solving, following ground rules, and dealing with emotions. He closes with wisdom on serving as a facilitator in your own organization and on the facilitative leader. His opening sections on how facilitation helps groups achieve their goals and establishing the foundation for facilitation lay the groundwork for his later chapters.In the opening chapters, he includes two models worth mentioning. In his \\"group effectiveness model\\" (p.23), Schwarz shows how group processes (the primary concern of the facilitator) interact with group structure and organizational context to contribute to a group effectiveness. Group effectiveness is assessed through three criteria: (1) The group's services or products meet or exceed the expectations of the clients; (2) The processes and structures used to deliver services or create products enhance the group's capacity to work together; and (3) The group's experience is satisfying, not frustrating, for the group's members. In the second noteworthy model, Schwarz presents the \\"diagnosis-intervention cycle\\" (p. 68). In this cycle, there are three diagnostic steps and three intervention steps. In the diagnostic phase, the facilitator observes behavior, infers meaning and decides whether to intervene. In the intervention phase, s/he describes observations, test her/his inferences, and helps the group decide whether and how to alter behaviors. Understanding and using these models are critical for effective facilitation.For the would-be facilitator or group leader, this book provides exactly what the subtitle promises."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"Roger's book is a unique hybrid of theory, practical exercises, examples, and personal stories. It works! The art and science of facilitation (to make easy or easier) is presented clearly, concisely, and completely. And, that is what I enjoyed about Roger's book so much. He gives it to you with &quot;the bark on.&quot; He makes you aware of the good, the bad, and the ugly relative to the practice of facilitation.I had used this book for several years in my work as a trainer, facilitator, and manager. Then, I had the pleasure to attend a workshop conducted by Roger. He lives what he teaches. While I was fortunate enough to have my company pay for the workshop, it is one of only three workshops I have ever attended that I feel like I would pay my own money to attend.Keep this book nearby. It is THE best read on this subject out there."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"Schwarz, Roger, M. (1994). The Skilled Facilitator, San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass Inc.,Publishers.C.E.Vajko (c.ernie@worldnet.att.net) March 14, 1999.The author integrates the theory and practice of group facilitation in a simple and structured sequence. A work that could serve both the practitioner and the practical scholar. The book includes examples of how to and how not to apply the principles of practice in a mentorship program. It includes examples of effective and ineffective facilitation. The examples of actual dialogue given by the author give the reader an excellent insight to how some facilitators intervene. Step by step instructions for group facilitation, and resources that can be used effectively between facilitator and client are given. The book is strong in group facilitation principles to improve problem solving and decision making.Managers of group and/or organizations, group consultants, facilitators, or those that want to become facilitators or organization development consultants could benefit from this book. Basically this book is for anyone that wants to improve their professional effectiveness in any field.The book addresses an area that is important for mentors as well as facilitators working with large groups of people. Communication, conflict management, problem solving, decision making, boundary management, motivating task, clear goals, are just a few of the areas that are covered. I found this book delivers what it promises. I give it a 5 star."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"The skilled facilitator introduces a facilitation approach that is based on 4 core values: Valid information, Free and informed choice, internal commitment and compassion. Most of the work on the values are based on the work of Chris Argyris and his work on Organizational Learning.One of the key-points in the book is that most people work with a unilateral control theory-in-use. This will automatically make their facilitation in-efficient eventhough they do not realize it. The skilled facilitator approach is to try to move away from this theory-in-use and move to a \\"mutual learning\\" theory-in-use in which the facilitator tries to maximize the learning for him and his participants. The four core values provide a basis for that. Next to the core values there are 9 ground rules which are concrete enough to really act upon.Most of the book explains the ideas behind the core values and the ground rules and shows how the ground rules influence your facilitation. This is done with scenarios in which the author shows a normal approach and a skilled facilitator alternative approach.The book ends with a wonderful chapter on \\"the facilitative leader\\", which shows how you can combine the skilled facilitator values and ground rules and your role as a leader within the organization. This chapter alone would have been worth the book already.I finished the book fairly quick. It's easy to read and kept me interested at all times. It also kept me thinking about the content when I was not reading it. Changing a theory-in-use is a difficult thing, but thanks to this book, I've become more aware of my own approach to facilitation and have the ability to improve it."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"I have read many books about group process and group facilitation. \\"The Skilled Facilitator\\" is the best I have read. It is: (a) comprehensive, (b) rooted in actual, tested theories, and (c) practical (though often tough to implement). It advances a set of ideas that are different from those about which most people will already have read, and this sometimes makes the ideas challenging -- sometimes to understand, but certainly to implement. However, difficult as these ideas may be, they are both valid and essential to the understanding and management of healthy organizations. I have found that most books about issues in management either talk down to the reader or over-simplify complex issues for the sake of popularity. If you want an easy book with popular ideas that are immediately understandable by anyone, sound like common sense, and make you immediately feel good, then this book probably is not for you. This book *is* for you if you want a book that: (a) tells the truth, even when it might be tough to confront, (c) will challenge you to learn new ideas, and (c) will challenge you to change your organization, team, or personal style in profound ways, even when such change will be hard. If you're open to being challenged and to changing the ways in which you think and act, reading this book will, at minimum, change the way you think. If you are able to actually implement this new thinking, \\"The Skilled Facilitator\\" will also radically improve your organization, your teams, and yourself."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"One of the things that struck me about this excellent guide to the art and skill of facilitation is the way in which Schwarz declares, unequivocally, who he is to his clients. He asks them to agree to work with the behaviors and values he believes form an effective group. Some facilitators do not have a strong \\"spine\\" in this way - they may be a nonjudgmental, caring or insightful presence, but they do not hold a group to a set of values and practices. If a client does not agree with Schwarz's normative model for how a group should function, fine with him - that group needs to find another facilitator. I think all facilitators could benefit from this kind of declaration and then follow-through on their principles."},{"Title":"The Skilled Facilitator : Practical Wisdom for Developing Effective Groups (Jossey-Bass Management Ser.)","review":"This is the bible of facilitation.

What a GREAT book!! Such realism and incredible attention to detail."},{"Title":"A First Course in Probability Third Edition","review":"First all, everyone wishing to learn probability comes from different background, math level, and motivation. There is no book that suits all. Recently I needed to know something about moment generating functions. With all my advanced engineering background though, I find it difficult to get into probability.So I bought the following supposedly introductory texts: Ross, DeGroot, Stirzaker, Bersekas & Tsitsiklis. To me, Ross seems like a review lesson to cram for finals; it's choke full of examples but fairly spare in exposition. DeGroot is the opposite, long on descriptions but short on examples; by the time it finishes describing the problem, you have forgotten how to solve it. Probability is set up more as a prelude to statistics in the second half of the book. Stirzaker calls his book \\"elementary\\" the way Sherlock Holmes dismissed a case after slogging all night through the English bogs. It is more for the well-drilled boys from elite British \\"public\\" (private actually) schools. Bersekas comes closest to what I look for in a text, straightforward in prose with a judicious selection of examples to explain theory.For beginners, the best approach I found, in the end, was to go the local community college and buy the text used for Finite Math. Usually, there are 3 to 4 chapters that introduce probability.Such a text is aimed an audience from wider academic and language backgrounds, as community colleges are mandated to do. Therefore, probability is taught in simple, plain-spoken language crafted through multiple editions. One such is Finite Math, by Karl J. Smith; however, many others like it will do. For self-study, one might start in the chapter on probability to understand the author's approach, then go back a chapter or two to pick up the permutation and combinatorial math needed to calculate probability. Another alternative is just to enroll in a Finite Math course at a community college. Generally, such a course stops at Markov's chain which is enough to get you jump started in probability.In any case, a good Finite Math text gives plenty of examples with clear, succinct, and layman-like explanation to help you tackle Ross' book or supplement any other at a higher level. If you plan to apply probability to your work, then shop around for another text after you get the basics. The thicker tomes delve more into theory which is good because real life problems are seldom like the examples given. However you can't go wrong by planting your feet solidly on a good Finite Math text first"},{"Title":"A First Course in Probability Third Edition","review":"So, prior to purchasing this book for my Introductory Course, I was informed that some of this book is written &#34;oddly&#34; by Mr. Ross and to be prepared.As it turns out, my professor was underplaying that fact. Mr. Ross does in fact give many examples but his strategies are NOT consistent. Which can be a good or a bad thing. For me, it is a BAD thing. I love this edition because it is not a &#34;new age&#34; text book with 10000's of images and a veritable clown car of other stuff. It is math, pure and simple.

I have come over the years to see the sad truth that science these days is being severly compromised by marketplace economics. Since our science is no longer truly in the hands of scientists, it behooves us to listen to someone who has the insider knowledge about how the data is manipulated and his valuable speculations on how the drugs really work.

There were typos on every single paragraph and I couldn't distinguish where each hymn and story started or stopped. All the words were squeezed together so you couldn't decipher anything!This seems like a scam to me... knowing that I paid $30 for something that was thrown together by a horrible editing/publishing company. It's not worth the money. I will now be on the lookout for the TRUE and CLEAR version of Christophers book. Please don't waste your money on this. The condition will disappoint you as it did me."},{"Title":"Jill has two ponies","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was a kid. It's a must for any horse-crazy young girl. In addition to being just plain a fun book, it's a good lesson on how things are more complicated than they seem, and that meaness usually has a reason."},{"Title":"The firstborn,: A play in three acts","review":"Christopher Fry's &quot;Firstborn&quot; is a verse play on the story of Exodus. He pictures Moses' choice between Egyptian princehood or freedom for the Hebrews as a choice between desire and wisdom. Moses feels compelled to obey the command of his conscience, but finds little happiness in doing so. The play was written in 1946, and the oppression of the Hebrews in Egypt serves as a vehicle for examining the injustice for the Jews of Fry's day."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Having occassionally read this strip in a newspaper I don't regularly purchase, I knew I wanted to see more of it, and so I ordered the first collection. Believe me, I'm ordering ALL the collections! This is a whimsical bit of fun, featuring, especially, a cat that brings back memories of two other wacky felines, Mehitabel and Krazy Kat. At times, I grinned. At times, I grinned with empathy. At times, I laughed out loud. If you like dogs, or love cats, or both, or just enjoy a good laugh, I heartily recommend this book...and the others in the series that I WILL be ordering!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Fans of classic newspaper strips, and of comics-based narrative, know what I'm saying here. MUTTS is the best thing to happen to the funny pages since that kid with the stuffed tiger. Many have called him our new Herrimann, but, despite having a cat in the strip, I think that's misleading: McDonnell is our new Cliff ('Polly and Her Pals') Sterrett. He shares so many of Sterrett's strengths and tendencies it's scary. Buy this book and help keep the dying lost art of the syndicated strip alive another day!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"I will keep this short and simple. The first volume of \\"Mutts\\" by Patrick McDonnell is simply the best comic strip since \\"Bloom County.\\" This book was touching, funny, and cute. It took me to that special place where life is cozy and beautiful. If Mr. McDonnell can keep this strip going at a high level of quality like this first volume, then I will plan on reading \\"Mutts\\" for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"When I read my first Mutts strips, I knew I had to have the books. I own them all, and I love them all. The strips are smart, touching, thought-provoking, memorable and funny. Not since A. A. Milne's Pooh Corner have animal characters possessed such distinctive and interesting traits and personalities. I can't wait for MUTTS V to come out so I can see what's new with Mooch, Earl, Guard Dog, Crabby, Sid, Shtinky Puddin', Woofie and the rest of the gang! Patrick McDonnell is a true dude."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"I loved it so much I bought ALL of Patrick McDonnell's other books and an extra for my dad, who also likes comics. McDonnell has a true gift in capturing innocence through an animal's eyes, and draws out in us that parental mushy feeling that we pet lovers are all too familiar with. He consistently delivers chuckles page after page and seemingly never runs out of ideas. I am also in great admiration of the man who dedicates his art to reminding this busy planet that animals are people too and they need a good home and lots 'o love just like we do. He well deserves the many awards he's received for his work."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Without a doubt Mutts (and Mutts II) is the best comic in the papers now . . . and these books are a must own. The humor is original and fresh; if you look close enuff, between the dialogue and the artwork, there's usually a few subtle chuckles to be discovered besides the punchline. Mooch &amp; Earl are my heros . . . almost wish I were a dog or cat!!!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"WONDERFUL! Be prepared to laugh until the tears roll down your face. If possible start with this book and read the books in sequence to be introduced to each of the characters. Besides...the books are all wonderful so ENJOY!If you appreciate animals you can't help but love Mutts. Patrick McDonnell has captured human and fuzzy characteristics to perfection. He obviously appreciates and delights in the special qualities of all the species that share this world andrecognizes our responsibilities to them as well as to ourselves.And he shares all of that in a uniquely delightful way."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"When Bill Waterson decided to retire he left a huge void that is still felt today. But along comes Mutts which help fills that void. The drawing brings back visions of old style comic strips the humor is at times sly, subtle, and then outright hilarious and the comparisons to Charles Schulz and Peanuts is well earned. Along with Zits and Baby Blues, Mutts shows that the comic strip form is still alive and kicking."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"This book is a wonderful collection for any Mutts fan. The Mutts comic strip is so refreshing with it's delightfully uncomplicated main characters, Earl and Mooch, who want nothing but to love and be loved, and perhaps get a handout from the Fatty Snax man. Their simple outlook on life is a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of today's world. Even the artwork is clean and uncluttered. Some of the \\"stories\\" in this collection are simple one-liners, and some cover several pages. Some are funny, and others are simply sweet and heartwarming. Mutts is the perfect comic for any cat or dog lover, as the loveable idiosyncracies of each are highlighted here in a way that's sure to bring a smile to the reader's face. This or any of the other Mutts comic books would make a perfect treat for yourself or gift for a cat/dog-loving friend."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Mutts has become my absolute favorite strip--high praise for a confirmed funny pages addict! I have two of Mr.McDonnell's books and plan to buy all of 'em!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"MUTTS, a simply and sweetly drawn cartoon, is a welcome relief from the tedious, recycled, pseudo-hip and tiresome junk that appears in other cartoons. Mutts is fresh, clever, and portrays a fun (but not syrupy) relationship between Mooch and Earl and their humans, Ozzie, Millie and Frank. Anyone who has had cats AND dogs can relate to the pets' distinct attitudes and behavior, and knows that both species can get along just fine in the same household. Patrick McDonnell gives us a &quot;minimalist&quot; strip that is full of whimsy. More, please!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"This is the very first book collecting the Mutts comic strip. It's fun to see the cartoonist as he develops his craft. I have Mr. McDonnell's 'Bad Baby' and as it's older than Mutts you can see how he has progressed. From Bad Baby to the early Mutts to where he is now. There is a lot of charm in his earlier strips. At first glance it appears to be very sketchy but when you linger a little you see the style and craft that goes into each panel.All in all a wonderful start to a very endearing and enduring comic strip. This edition was published in 1996 and I read it and its successive brethren to my children who were 4 and 6 that year. We all love them to this day. You can't go wrong with such warmhearted comic strips."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"This is a comic that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. The puns are actually amusing, rather than tedious. McDonnell has created a warm and wonderful world within Mutts. Its simple humor and likeable characters should appeal to anyone who is tired of today's &quot;high tech&quot; (or whatever) comics.Review by Jeremy Ross"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"It is so nice to have something Gentle in the world... sweet... calm...

This book and it's sequel are great!"},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Just a delight. The drawings by McDonnell could stand on their own as the storytelling device, but he does such a nice job of giving them unique voices that I can only say McDonnell has made something perfect even better."},{"Title":"Mutts","review":"Gentle, cute, amusing, and charming... get this book and talk your local paper into running this strip!One of the many things I like about this strip is that the cat and dog act like a cat and dog (of course, not the talking part!)

The book's first section contains Extracts from Records concerning persons named Sessions in Essex County, MA. The records transcribed range in date from the late 17th to the early 19th centuries, and include probate records, deeds and quit claims, other court records and depositions, and town records which include lists of letters.The second section, Letters, presents letters written by numerous Sessions family members across the country at the request of the compiler. Most were written in the 19th century, but incidents referenced and material included date as far back as the 17th century. These letters, which trace ancestry and descendants of the letter writers, present biographical sketches of many family members, and provide invaluable genealogical data. Included is the genealogy of Nathaniel Sessions of Pomfret CT. The book's third section is titled Estrays, and contains miscellaneous stray Sessions records, such as appointments, deaths, marriages, extracts from newspaper articles and accounts, etc.Final sections contain records on Early Generations of the Sessions Family, such as the 17th century vital records of Alexander Sessions of Andover, MA, and his descendants; a biographical sketch of, and listing of the descendants of, Nathaniel Sessions (b.1680 in CT); the descendants of Robert Sessions Jr. of South Wilbraham, MA; a biographical sketch and a lineage of Francis C. Sessions; the descendants of John Sessions )b. 1741); and a genealogy of the family of George Sessions and Eunice Mather.The Appendix includes miscellaneous letters and remiiniscences, plus biographical sketches of Walter L. Sessions (born at Brandon VT), Rev. John Sessions D.D. (born in Westminster VT), Alonzo Sessions of Ionia MI (b. 1810), Judge William M. Sessions(b. 1827) and William R. Sessions (b. 1835). A genealogical table of the Sessions Family is also included. Portraits of family members are scattered throughout, and an index of persons named Sessions rounds out the volume."},{"Title":"MATERIALS FOR A HISTORY OF THE SESSIONS FAMILY IN AMERICA, THE DESCENDENTS OF ALEXANDER SESSIONS","review":"I dont really recommend it unless you are doing genealogy on the Sessions family. It was alright but It wasnt the right people for me. I also have a complaint about Amazon.com you have a business that you get coupons from that is some how hooked up with you site. They had my debit card number and every thing. They also had two months worth of charges on my account for $19.95 a month. So if anyone gets the samething call your bank or your credit card company. Oh, and I wont be ordering from you because you dont have paypal."},{"Title":"Beautiful Girlhood - Gospel Publishers","review":"I just finished reading a few of the reviews on the revised version of this book. Its scary to hear how intensly some girls hate it. Though I do not feel the original was in need of revising, people who do not like the revised version would not like this, either. Why not? Because, unlike so many other authors, Mable Hale says what is really true, rather than what she knows we would like to hear. Yes, women do not have as many restrictions as they did in the olden days. Back then, they didn't even date . . . boys called on a girl in her own home. Back then, if a girl wore makeup, fancy hairstyels, and revealing clothes, proper society was scandelized. Back then, Mable Hale was concerned about the percentage of boys who smoked, and told crude jokes. Today, we have date rape. Today, girls walk into Sunday school with skirts so short that their underwear shows when they cross their legs. Today, almost as many girls smoke as boys (even Rachel Joy Scott - a Columbine martyre - smoked for a while), and use vulgar expressions at the drop of a hat . . . And today, Beautiful Girlhood's message of purity and discipline is needed more desperately than ever before."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"As another reviewer stated, too much violence. Must have wanted to do a bit of hippie bashing(also a bit too sensational grabbing). Still it is McGee and not a totally bad read. Green Ripper is the best one I've read."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"I have read several of the McGee series with my favorites the ones that aren't so erotic or violent. This one seems to have a lot of both in it and I'm not sure why. I guess as time went by for JDM it seemed more necessary or maybe it was a reflection of the times that the vlolence and sex became more diviant, cruel and prominant. I much prefer the earlier books when there was more of a campy necessary point to the violence and more of a visual behind closed doors than a full out play by play bedroom scene. This book was awfully heavy on that and took up many pages and was sort of depressing. But I did find this book very intriguing especially as McDonald really paints a scene and you feel as though you can not only imagine the sights but hear the background noise of the busy city. I lived this era although on the younger side of when this was written compared to the characters I am glad that era is over. I really did not like the hippie era and was sorry that it was my generation's contribution. I felt scared in my own time of all the drugs and strange opinions running counter to all that had been safe and secure in society. They didn't really have an answer just wanted to \\"drop out\\" but made nothing any better by doing so. It's interesting to note this era was followed by the yuppie and preppy eras.I did feel that there may have been too many characters in this book and that the problems of the \\"girl\\" the story centers around were never really made clear. Why was she the way she was and to the extent? Many people have tragedy in life but don't resort to such self destruction. All in all a good book a little out of character for JDM in some of the more graphic areas."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"It really doesn't matter which Travis McGee book you are reading because they are all so pleasureable that it is like slipping into a warm bath. They possess great narrative drive and a character that is at once bigger than life, self-deprecating, philosophical and all too human.Travis Mcgee is a great figure in literature. Over the 20 years or so that MacDonald wrote these 21 novels(all with a color in the title and all with the title somewhere in the novel), McGee aged by about a year for every three that MacDonald wrote. His insights grew sharper, his cynicism and self loathing battled with his heroic life and his incredible pleasures. His reliance on his physical dexterity and strength diminished as his cunning increased.The books were written between approximately 1964 to 1984. This particular book was written in 1969. Relatively early in the saga, and one of a handful taking place in Mexico. Most took place in South Florida where he lived on a houseboat. Where else could he live?He went to Mexico to find out what happened to a friend's daughter. Traveling with his frequent companion, Meyer, he uncovers some sinister plot and we are introduced to some great memorable characters, and always fabulous women including Elena from Guadalahara and Becky, a sexual machine. Since it is the late 60's, you get to see the hippies in Mexico and McGee's relation to them.The wonder and greatness of these books lies in the writing and the creation of a world and a being that you are lucky to tag along with during your time together."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"If there is a weak link in the chain of Travis McGee novels, I have yet to find it. MacDonald's \\"Dress Her In Indigo\\" is yet another great tale in the long list of books of the McGee cycle, and I have read more than a dozen of them. This one has the same driving pace, magnetic and realistic characters, and acerbic wit as any other in the series."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"A classic commentary on the 60s counterculture by John McD. A group of flower children are scattered across Mexico and have information concerning Bix Bowie's last days. As Meyer and McGee unravel the story, the gang starts dropping like flies. Several neat twists and a jawdropping finale. Reading this book brought back memories of old Dragnet and Adam-12 shows featuring the degenerate hippies. Trav gets more work in the bedroom than in any other I've read. Along the way he gets to pummel a homosexual AND a lesbian(not that there's anything OK with that, they just had it comin' to them)."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"If I recall, John D. MacDonald considered this novel a \\"failure.\\" But a failure by MacDonald would be a success for most other writers. It's not the best in the McGee series but still has much to recommend it. The prose remains superb, there are quirky and interesting characters, a very, unlikely villain and a few surprising twists and turns. It was written in 1969 and the social upheaval of the times is in the background of the novel, even though it takes place in Mexico. As such, there are sections that can be read as an insightful sociological treatise on the times.I think you have to rate \\"Gold,\\" \\"Silver\\" and \\"Green\\" as the best of this series, but don't overlook \\"Indigo\\" either."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"Travis McGee takes on the Isle of Lesbos, below the border, copyright 1969.

More than that, he winds up in a car wreck and loses the use of his legs. Insurance money pours in -- which he has no use for -- so he hires McGee to find out what happened to his daughter, last seen heading off for a pleasure jaunt through Mexico. All the threads lead to Oaxaca, where McGee and and his enormously interesting friend Meyer begin digging.There are, as always, too many unexplained threads to the story.

It's amazing how well these hold up after all these years.

The plot, while complex, flows smoothly as author John D. MacDonald makes the most of the rich Mexican settings against which the lion's share of the narrative unfolds.Sent south of the border by a grieving father, desperate to know what led to the tragic death of his daughter in the remote mountains of Oaxaca, McGee and Meyer encounter a sordid world of drugs and exploitation with multiple innocent and not so innocent victims.Contributing to the considerable appeal of Dress Her in Indigo are the presence of a number of interesting plot twists and the fact that McGee's well known tendency to regale the reader with his unsolicited opinions on multiple topics is kept to a non-annoying minimum.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dress Her in Indigo","review":"Beautifully narrated by Darren McGavin, a master of the craft: John D.

The uniqueness of this book is having 3 stories that all connect in a smooth transition. The consistency of the main characters and the realistic settings of each story suspended my usual skepticism towards fiction.In terms of the book's Christian aspect, as a fellow believer, I thought the book had realistic portrayals of how Christians struggle with their faith in a God who allows painful ordeals in life, but who remains faithful and true to those who persevere and maintain their belief."},{"Title":"Heartfelt Cases","review":"I highly recommend everyone to read this book!

Don't miss out on buying this great book!!"},{"Title":"On Children and Death","review":"The death of a child is a horrific and heartrending moment in a parent's life, a time where no words can be used, because it is totally inexpressible. Yet, somehow, Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross does find the words, and she does so by doggedly and mercifully examining children and death. By her own direct involvement as a thanatologist as well as through a series of letters by bereaved parents who have lost children by way of terminal illness, sudden death, murder or suicide, they open their hearts, and in the process of doing so, they reveal psychological and religious elements of their children, premonitions and preparatory acts before acknowledged death to an acute maturity and understanding of themselves and their situations. A role inversion-depending on the age level-frequently happenes, whereby the little patient becomes the comforter for their family who must temporally remain behind in the \\"cocoon,\\" a most comforting euphemism indeed. Read the story of \\"Edou\\" in the segment, The Spiritual Aspects of Work with Dying Children for specific clarity. But what Kubler-Ross stresses is communication, getting the feelings out, not immediately mollifying the topsy-turvey senses with instant self-medication, for more-often-than-not, that can only compound the psychological stresses that can easily fracture with devistating repercussions, as is illustrsted with the examples at the beginning of the book. Also addressed in conjunction with communication and open dialogue is family involvement with the dying process, letting the siblings be exposed to their older or younger brother/sister's dying, unless they make it concretely evident that they are not emotionally ready for that step, which is perfectly fine and understandable. It is about pacing, self-acceptance and sympathetic exposure to what is for most of us a mind-numbing experience. But it does not have to be that way. And Kubler-Ross cites numerous examples throughout On Children and Death, instancing how the funeral industry is evolving for the better as well as humanistic/ holistic expressions via arts, crafts and musical aid in smoothing the rough edges of suffering and self-created mental torment. Yes, grief and unbelieveable pain will exist, but it does not have to dominate, for God is certainly in the equation, for He knows all, sees all and feels all, and Kubler-Ross, wonderfully, blatantly, lets that be known, for as a friend contributed to this volume: \\"To me, religions are like the spokes on a wheel; they all lead to the hub--at-oneness with God (P. 204). How true! How true!"},{"Title":"On Children and Death","review":"I was leery about reading a book dealing with children and death. This book was sensitive to the issue and the personal stories contained inside were tear jerkers. I found the book to be extremely appropriate to the issue of children and dying. I would recommend this book to anyone who may have to go through this issue."},{"Title":"On Children and Death","review":"I found that this book wasn't as helpful as I needed. I was taking a psychology course dealing with how to incorporate death education into an elementary school setting and this basically just gave stories about people/children dealing with death and ways to incorporate all family members. A much better book is Helping Childrne Live with Death and Loss by Dinah Seibert. It gives a way to create lesson plans/field trips/discussions about death with children while also including the stages of grief."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Grand Design","review":"Robert Freeman Wexler takes his readers down paths that no one else ever thought about. Here we have a man running away to join the circus -- a simple enough story, one with which we're all familiar. Of course, the circus exists in a fantastical dimension, but that is only to be expected. What makes this book so special is not that reality is bent, but the way in which Wexler bends it. Just as in his highly praised novella \\"In Springdale Town,\\" Wexler once again shows us a world from a different angle, combing factors in ways unlike anyone else."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A favorite because my grandma loved to read it to me, this is the tale of Ferdinand, who everyone mistakenly believes is the fiercest bull around.

During a time of incredible busyness, turmoil, and worry, we can all take a page out of Ferdinand's story and just sit, be present, and observe the beauty that surrounds us all.

I love the story of Ferdinand the Bull. I was tickled to get it at such a low price. My Labrador Retriever sits under my nectarine tree sniffing the air...just as Ferdinand does by the cork tree. Thank you, Jenny"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was delighted to discover the book still in print, and still cherished by today's youngsters. I remember mine from my childhood, when the book was first published, and am so pleased to have a copy again.. Still a great story for kids to enjoy -- and especially with their grandparents who knew it when."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"So, I had this and read it to my children a thousand times. Then I spent six months in Andalucia, Spain and discovered this book is an accurate representation of it. The illustrations actually appear to be Spain from Madrid to Andalucia, especially the Frontera, including Ronda and Vejer de la Frontera or Arcos de la Frontera.On top of that, the story of Ferdinand is about being who you are, and being at peace with yourself - whether it conforms to society's expectations or not. Subtly, and well, done.Beautiful pictures, beautiful story, peaceful theme. What more can you ask, whether you are an innocent child or a world-weary adult?Worth buying and sharing with someone you love."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A charming story with drawings of real artistry and taste. I had this book as a child and wanted it for my children.Plenty of other reviews rightly praise the book so I will simply say that, yes, of course, it's a five-star childrens' book.One further thing needs praising, however: the quality of the actual book. This does the contents honour: first class paper and a lovely binding make the book an even more worthwhile purchase. It's wonderful that one can still buy things of such quality."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was given The Story of Ferdinand for Christmas in about 1950, when I was six. Over fifty years later, I still enjoy it more than any other children's book I know. I'm writing this after ordering a copy for my granddaughter. There is not a word out of place in the story. Each page makes you smile (and any child between the ages of five and a hundred) and each has a perfect pen drawing that adds to the fun. I also use the book with my young-teenager students in their second year of learning English. I find they understand it and enjoy it and even learn it by heart. Like many millions of his fans, I am sure that Ferdinand is \\"still sitting there under his favourite cork tree smelling the flowers.\\""},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"When I was a little girl, I would request this book constantly. I never got sick of the story, and it has a valuable lesson of compassion, that just sinks in. I would reccomend it for any child."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Ferdinand is a pacifist who enjoys sitting under a tree smelling the flowers. He is completely uninterested in fighting and when the local bullfighters come out the field to find fighting bulls, they ignore Ferdinand....until Ferdinand is stung by a bee and puts on a show that impresses the matadors. Ferdinand is taken to the arena for a bullfight; however, he refuses to fight and is returned to the field. The matadors have all the gory swords which are not used in the book. My 3 year old son wanted to know why there were swords which presented an interesting dilemma. In my opinion, this book is not for children who are younger than 3. As stated above, 3 year olds need a lot of careful explanation about the story. They do not need to know why and how the swords are used. The violence of the bullfight is not central to this story. Ferndinand's character and his refusal to fight is. This is a beautiful story that your child will enjoy."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is an enchanting and timeless tale, and is everything a children's book should be. The message is not simply one of peace and commitment to an ideal, but also one of basic karma, existentialist philosophy of choice and responsibility, and the need for all to follow the Golden Rule.The Story of Ferdinand lets children know it is okay to stay true to their characters, and will encourage them to think their way out of situations, rather than muscle their way out. Ferdinand's peaceful and contented nature is something all human beings should all aspire to.Having been stung by many bees in my youth, mainly while traipsing barefoot through clover and accidentally stepping on them, I have great sympathy for our hero and the situation he finds himself in. The realization that even small events and actions can have a tremendous impact on our lives, and everything else that surrounds us in this world, is beautifully presented in this story. How Ferdinand chooses to deal with his plight at being taken away to fight is, of course, the heart and significance of this tale. His choice of poetic action is a perfect lesson in morality and provides the lasting appeal for this book.I recommend this classic for all ages and peoples, especially in our troubled times. It has a wonderful philosophy of life message; and even if readers choose not to apply the lesson to real life, the charming tale of Ferdinand is worth reading simply for its power to delight and entertain.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"or in other words, your own wonderful, individual, YOU! Ferdinand the Bull, the peaceful bovine, who's content with just smelling the flowers under Spain's cork trees (doing his &quot;own thing&quot;), in spite of the pressure of his peers to be a ferocious fighting bull......is an inspiring way to share with your children how great it is to be DIFFERENT. That you can be anything you want in life and not to let anyone tell you otherwise. This was my favorite book as a child, it inspired me creatively and I've lived by it's simple message: BE who you ARE."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and is now my two-year-old's favorite story. While bullfighting may seem to be an inappropriate topic for a toddler, the message of the story is that Ferdinand does not want to fight and that's just fine. The best aspect of the book, however, are the pictures and the wonderful expressions of all the characters, from the ladies with flowers in ther hair to poor Ferdinand after he is stung by the bee. This story is great for all ages."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I have my father's copy which is now over 65 years old...and to this day that picture of Ferninand getting stung by a bee on his bum never fails to make me guffaw. I ordered a copy for a friend with a little boy about 5 years old, and he absolutely loves it. The whole project was executed beautifully, from the story line to the artfully placed drawings that are detailed, evocative and humorous. Ferninand is from another time -- it's about self-discovery, the deception of appearances, acceptance, and sitting under that cork tree just smelling the flowers. This book deserves more stars than just five."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I like this book a lot. It's the story of a bull who would rather stop and smell the flowers than do anything else, unlike the other bulls who spend their time snorting and jumping around. When he accidentally sits on a bumblebee he jumps around like crazy and is taken away to a bullfight where instead of fighting he sits down and admires the flowers worn in the hair of the pretty ladies in the crowd. This book does mention sticking swords into the bulls, so that may be a little disturbing for younger kids. I think that slightly older kids who are like Ferdinand will enjoy this classic story and will be able to relate to his laid back personality."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I gave 75th Anniversary edition of The Story of Ferdinand the Bull to my 80 year old mother as a Christmas gift. She was delighted, as it was one of her favorite childhood books and she never thought she would own a copy again. She has enjoyed reading this serene tale of Ferdinand who instead of a being a mighty bull in the Spanish ring was more content to sit under the cork tree. The hardcover book came in a lovely slipcover and in a timely fashion."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I have been thinking about buying this book since I saw the movie Blind Side.

There was a scene in the library where the kids were reading this and my son who is 15 and he commented that he loved having that book read to him and when he could read he would read it at night in his bed.That promted me to get the book for him for Christmas and put it in his stocking.A great book for any age!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, so yes I may be just a bit bias! Hurray for those of us who choose to be ourselves and live our authentic lives the way we wish not the way society wishes upon us. And even a bigger HURRAY for those who read this book to your children and instil in them the true meaning of this story - in two words \\"BE YOURSELF\\" This story is funny, poignant, and beautifully illustrated with real art not computer generated art like the majority of modern picture books.

Not only does the story relate Ferdinand's preference for a peaceful life in the country rather than the boisterous sport of bull-fighting... the story supports the need for each individual to find his or her own life style. Robert Lawson's drawings marvelously convey the sensibilities of all the characters."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I ordered this book for a friend and read it myself first. I had only seen the disney cartoon before. The story was the same, and even some of the drawings were similar to the cartoon.

After reading the book I think disney did a great job turning it into a cartoon that stays close to the book."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I adore this book, my Spanish teacher in Buenos Aires introduced me to this wonderful gentle tale, I used to read it to my son, and even now I prefer reading it in Spanish, to my ears it sounds better.

We are going to Spain in July so I thought it might be nice to find a few Spanish-y stories to help set the scene and prep them for the upcoming experience. The only book that seemed to fit the bill on short notice was this one. My experience with this story is limited...I never read the book as a child but I did see the Disney short film and loved it.The hardback is lovely with a cloth binding that hearkens back to the children's books of my childhood (as opposed to the glossy, laminate books one frequently finds today). The story is sweet and perfectly paced -- great for preschoolers and early grades school kids. But the illustrations are what takes this book from good to great. They are detailed, nuanced, and accurate and they captivate my girls every time (that's pretty darned amazing considering they're in black and white). My oldest likes to lie in bed and pour over the pages, teasing out the details of the castles on the hills or the lace fans held by the Spanish ladies.All in all, this is a lovely book with a nice message and plenty to keep young boys and girls interested."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book has been a favorite of mine when I was young and is now loved by my grandchildren.

For a child who is in early elementary school and is just starting to feel that he isn't quite like the other children his age, the affirmation that it is OK to be who you are is really powerful.A handfull of reviews have complained that the bullfighting theme is too violent for toddlers, I'm tempted to rake Amazon over the coals for recommending this book for such a young age group. But then, I know booksellers are having a hard time convincing parents that not all picture books are intended for preschoolers, and in fact many are intended for older children. By the time children are in kindergarten, I suspect very few will be shocked by the suggestion of violence in the book, and most will be ready to related to the central themes."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I remembered the book from 35 years ago when I used to read it to my son, when I saw it again in the movie Blind Side (with Ms. Sandra Bullock), I decided to buy it for my grandson.

Thank you, Mama,&#34; and my youngest agreed saying, &#34;me too.&#34; I love the book myself for many reasons: the morale of the story (which is, it is ok to be different), it's a children book/story from another country (Spain), and children love animals and flowers, which The Story of Ferdinand has plenty of.

While I didn't like it all that much in first grade, I remembered it and read it to my daughter when she was in first grade. Ferdinand is a bull that is growing up in Spain, and his favorite thing to do is to sit around and smell the flowers. The other bulls are fierce and fight all the time, which prepares them for the bullfighting ring.Unfortunately, when the people arrive to select a bull for the next bullfighting exhibition, Ferdinand sits on a bee, which stings him and his gyrations appear to be anger and hostility. They select him, and transport him to the arena. When the moment of the fight comes, all of the men in the arena are afraid of Ferdinand, but he simply sits down and smells the flowers in the hats of the spectators. Nothing that they can do will get him angry, so they load him up and ship him back to the pasture where he came from.My daughter loved this book when I read it to her, asking me to read it several times. It is a nice story for children, although it does cover up the true brutality of bullfighting."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was hesitant to buy this \\"75th Anniversary edition\\" because I was afraid it would have a yellow \\"75th\\" sticker on it.

This anniversary hardcover edition comes with a heavy duty sleeve, as thick as the book cover. The actual cover of the book (it has no jacket) looks just like the sleeve, minus the yellow \\"75th\\" sunburst. The sleeve and book are packaged together in shrink wrap.I bought this edition to replace our paperback copy which fell apart after 15 years.

This is the book Mrs. Tuohy (Bullock)reads to Mike. It describes Mike's character in comparison to Ferdinand's. I loved this book, because I have a daughter that reminds me of Ferdinand, also. Ferdinand is different from all the other bulls he grows up with. He is thoughtful and prone to sit quietly and smell the flowers under a cork tree. His mother is worried he doesn't get more involved with the other bulls in running, jumping and butting heads. But he is content to just sit in the shade and smell the flowers. Which is not a bad thing. In the end, when he is expected to fight in a bull fight, he decides it's not his thing and just sits and does nothing, but smell the flowers in the ladies' hair. He is taken back home to the country which makes him very happy. The audio recording on CD that came with this book is perfectly narrated. The narrator has an authentic Spanish accent and speaks with animation. The illustrations are black and white, but are very detailed and leaves much to the reader's imagination.

One day a group comes looking for the biggest toughest bull they can find. Ferdinand was going to do his usual thing of sitting under a tree and smelling flowers but he sits on a Bee. He gets stung and charges around like crazy and so they pick him.My girl doesn't like bees as she was stung by one. However, the look on Ferdinand's face made it funny for her.Ferdinand goes to the fights and simply sits in the middle of the ring and smells the scent from the flowers in women's hair. Nothing will make him fight and he angers, depresses and makes the matadors cry since they can't show off.He is returned to his field and quickly returns to sitting under his tree and smelling the flowers.It's a sweet story and I think I will be reading it for a long time."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Parents of young children are called upon to read a beloved book over, and over, and over again.

I was fascinated by the illustrations, which took me to a far-away place and stimulated my imagination. But I was most impressed by the message of the story -- an encouragement to remain true to my own nature. That's a great lesson for kids, who are so vulnerable to pressure from peers and our culture. I am thankful that my parents provided this book. I have read and given copies of it to my kids and grandkids, and read the story in school to my grand-daughter's class.The Story of Ferdinand (Puffin Storytime)"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I am 44 years old and yesterday, at our Thanksgiving celebration at a relative's home, I came to read this wonderful book for the first time. I was so touched by it, really all choked up as I read about Ferdinand. I just couldn't hold back my tears. I will be reading this book to my 71 children, at the public school where I run an After School Program. This is a marvelous book and I recommed it to parents, teachers, educators and anyone else interested in planting seeds of peace into the hearts of others, specially children. I am Ferdinand, and I am happy. I also fell in love with his mother... what a loving, sweet cow...."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is not a review, others have done that excellently, it is a memory. When i was eight, Ferdinand was my favourite. Thirty eight years later and unremembered until finding it just now, the flashback was so intense i could hardly finish reading the Amazon review through tears of nostalgia. I smelled the flowers and felt that simple happiness that Ferdinand radiated all over again.

Like \\"They had sharp pins...to stick in the bull\\" \\"long spears to stick in the bull\\" \\"a sword...to stick the bull last of all.\\" One alternative (or to go with the book) is the Disney short film.

I received it within a few days of ordering it, and the book itself is of nice quality and should withstand the test of time! My daughter loves the book, and it does create a very definite sense of happiness and teaches a good lesson. It's about a bull named Ferdinand living in Spain who doesn't want to act like the other bulls by running around and butting heads. Ferdinand likes to sit under a cork tree and smell the flowers. By a funny accident, he is chosen to be a bull featured at the bull fights in Madrid, but he doesn't act the way they expect him to, and there is a nice ending. My only complaint (and the only reason I didn't give it five stars) are because of several lines in the book talking about sticking the bull with sharp objects to make him mad (\\"Picadores carrying long spikes to stick in the bull and make him madder\\"), and another line talking about how the Matador carries a sword to stick the bull last of all. My daughter has not asked questions about it yet, but it might upset some kids who understand what it is talking about. What I view as the violence and cruelty of bullfights is kept out of the book, and it has a happy ending and teaches a good lesson, so I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was and still is my favourite children's book. I have read it to my children and have just ordered some new copies in preparation for my grandchildren as my old copy is looking very tattered by now. It is a heartwarming and inspiring story of the gentle little bull Ferdinand who loved to sit under the cork tree and smell the flowers more than anything else. The bull fight scenes are sensitively handled but if you are terribly politically correct it may be worth reading the book first before reading it to your children."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a story that was new when Grandma and Grandpa were tykes. It is best read aloud with all of the fun that enunciation can bring to a story. I can still remember my mother reading it to me as a child.

After all, bullfights aren't really PC these days. If you try not to get too deep, it's still a nice story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Although I find the character of Ferdinand endearing and worth emulating, I have mixed feelings about this story because it glosses over the otherwise horrific, inhumane sport of bullfighting. It bothers me while reading this to a child because, as an adult, I am well aware that the usual outcome of bull fights or even the display of passive, noncooperation posed by Ferdinand is not at all pleasant. In other words, in real life poor Ferdinand would never have made it back home alive!It is also contradictory for readers to express so much sentiment for a bull when in real life, bulls and cows are tortured in factory farms and brutally killed on a daily basis; they are treated just like objects instead of anything worth loving. On the other hand, connecting with Ferdinand may somehow or other raise sensitivity and affection toward them."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I ordered this for my kids some years ago. I was disappointed because I thought it would be a book version of Disney's Ferdinand the Bull in full color. I had such a book as a kid, and never forgot the pictures. I have since been able to resurrect the original cartoon on tape."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Upon reading this book, I found it to be very shocking and inappropriate for young children. My students thought it to be a \\"bad story.\\" They \\"did not like it because the men wanted to hurt Ferdinand. They wanted to keep sticking him with spears and a sword.\\" My students asked me to stop reading the story because they felt very sad."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old son because my husband said it was his favorite book growing up. Well, this book was only one of his many problems from childhood. First of all, it speaks of the violence brought on a bull in a bull-fight (not appropriate for young kids in my opinion). The worst part, however, is the ineptitude of Ferdinand. He is a big, strong bull not at all interested in being what he is. He is lazy and just wants to look at flowers. He is a waste. I cannot fathom how anyone finds the story endearing..."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book is so inspiring. My children and I love it.

Luckily, my parents kept us stocked not only in the current (late 70-80s) kids' books, but some of the older classics they read as kids themselves. Among my favorites were classics from the '30s, including Ferdinand. I love the way that Ferdinand knows what he wants - to not fight in the bullring like the other bulls, but to just sit peacefully and smell the flowers. He is not shaken by peer pressure or \\"authority figures\\" (the men who round him up to fight after they see him snort and stamp after being stung by a bee) to be other than who he is. And his mother - even though she is only a cow (so says the book!) - supports him in his gentle ways. I just love it! My son is only a toddler and he has his phases as far as what books he likes, but this one is one he comes back to every so often. And I love reading it to him. That is only enhanced by the fact that I studied in Spain one summer and have seen half-ruined towns in the Spanish countryside. I picture Ferdinand's pasture somewhere near one of those towns, long ago, when the towns were bustling. A wonderful book for the imagination - and possible theme discussions as a child gets older. Get this charming book!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"The book is almost as old as I am, the story is older.

Bought this for my niece who just turned one. It may be a little young for this book but in six months she will love it."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book is more than sixty years old. I remember hearing it as a small child in the early sixties, and even then it sounded strangely old-fashioned to me, as if it came from some sweet, gentle world that had not existed for a long time. But as a child I passionately loved that world, and this book that evoked its gentleness, and years later, when I found out I was pregnant, the first thing I bought for my son was not a blanket or a crib or a stuffed animal, but a copy of Ferdinand. It was the thing I loved most from my own childhood. Seventeen years later, I still think my priorities were right. And that seventeen year old has a six year old sister, so the book is still in use.Ferdinand has been around so long, I assume everybody knows the story, but in case you don't, here goes: Ferdinand is a gentle little bull in Spain. The other little bulls love to fight and dream of being chosen for the bullfights in Madrid. But by mistake, Ferdinand is sent to fight. The only problem is, he will not fight.. They lead him into the bullring, but he just sits there, smelling the flowers in the women's hair, and in the end there is nothing the matadors can do but take him home.I suppose people have been reading this book to children for more than sixty years in part because of its pacifist message. In essence, Ferdinand is the one who would not come when they gave a war. But for me that is just a small part of its appeal. Robert Lawson's absolutely perfect illustrations show a world that is often mean and ugly (the stupid expressions on the faces of the men who come to choose the bulls are classics), or else petty and foolish (check out the fussy clothes and snooty expressions of the matadors), but Ferdinand, always true to himself, is oblivious to this world, and just goes on living his own life in his own way. In the end that quality is a force that nothing can alter.Reading Ferdinand always leaves me believing that goodness is a powerful, unshakeable force. That is a message I find very comforting lately."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"\\"Ferdinand\\" is one of the best-loved children's books of all time, and with good reason. This timeless tale of a little bull in Spain who doesn't mind being different from the rest of the herd strikes an instant chord in youngsters and oldsters alike. Ferdinand is a gentle creature who would rather sit around and smell the flowers than butt his way through life; but when he planks himself down one day on a bumblebee, he gets a jolt that propels him into the bullring in Madrid. The story is funny and endearing, and the illustrations are hilarious. Generations of preschoolers have loved this book, and it looks good for generations to come."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"My mother-in-law gave me her copy of this book (printed in 1938) when my oldest child was 4 or 5 years old and we just adored this story! In fact, she (my daughter) loved it so much she memorized it within months. I chose this book to read to her 2nd grade class and they, too, felt the magic of how the fierce bull loved to just sit and &quot;smell the flowers&quot;! I just sat down tonight to read it for the first time to my youngest child (5 years old) and he already knew how the story went. I asked him how he knew it and if his sister already read it to him, because I had not yet done so. He told me that nobody read it to him, that his sister (now 11 years old) already told him about it. He went on to explain every page to me before I even read it! Maybe it's because it's such a different subject for a children's book ( a bull, a tree, a bee and oh, those flowers!) or it could be because we don't have a great deal of access to bull fighting here in America...none the less, it's a story that stays with you, if only because of it's simplicity. Kind of refreshing."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I recently rediscovered this favorite book from my childhood (which was 40+ years ago now), and fell in love all over again. Now my 4 year old daughter and I both get to experience the exquisite pleasure of Ferdinand on a regular (i.e. nightly) basis. The gorgeous illustrations and simple, powerful story of the biggest bull on the farm who would rather \\"sit just quietly and smell the flowers\\", is as moving today as it was when it was written more than 50 years ago. And I cannot think of a more important lesson to teach our children today: that it is o.k. to be yourself, even when everyone else thinks you should be something else. This is a sweet, lovely story for children and adults alike, and is one of the few books I look forward to reading over and over again. Luckily, my daughter agrees."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I love Robert Lawson and I love Munroe Leaf, but ladies and gentlemen these two men are definitely less great unless paired together. In undoubtedly my favorite children's book from the 1930s (so sorry, \\"They Were Strong and Brave\\"), these two titans of the picture book world created the most adorable story to have ever involved cork trees, bulls, and sweet smelling flowers.Ferdinand is none too different from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\". He may look fierce and strong, but underneath that hard exterior lies a bull that is perfectly content to just sit beneath his favorite cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Ferdinand was gentle even when young, and he has no desire to go needlessly ramming his head with the other bulls in the field. When some wonderfully illustrated men arrive to find a bull worthy of their bull-fighting arena, Ferdinand is accidentally selected as their choice. Once in the arena, however, Ferdinand proceeds to humiliate the matador and his cronies through simple peace-loving flower-smelling. In the end, Ferdinand is returned to his cork tree and the world is as it was.There's a definite pacifist feel behind the old Ferdinand tale. In what other story will you have a creature not fight back despite all provocations, only to win in the end? Moreover, a male character that prefers pretty sights and smells to violence and uber-masculinity. Lawson's pen and ink drawings expertly compliment Leaf's tale. Through them we see the high balconies of Spanish towns, and the serene fields where little bulls may play. I was especially amused by the cork tree, from which actual wine corks hang. I suspect many a child has subsequently believed for years that corks really do grow on the vine as Lawson displayed them. Lawson isn't above other humorous tweaking beyond that. On the front and end papers of the book is an image of children gawking at a ferocious picture of \\"angry\\" Ferdinand. The poster goes on to advertise treats at the bull fight including \\"hot dogos\\" and \\"chocolato\\". Apparently any word with an appropriate \\"o\\" tacked on the end is instantly Spanish.\\"Ferdinand\\" is the sweetest of the Leaf/Lawson tales. However you feel about the nature of violence (and about how it is almost required of the males of society) this is the quintessential story about being yourself. The angry over-masculine bulls may fight and brawl but peaceful Ferdinand is the one to outwit the men in the end."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book has been one of my favorites, if not my favorite for years. I did not discover it until after I saw Disney's short of the story about 20 years ago. Disney's short was made in the 50s or 60s, I think. Ferdinand is the most endearing character and a great messege to tell children that they don't have to follow the crowd to be happy and we can break the mold and be peaceful and non-violent. This is only part of the greatness of this book...the illustration are the absolutely most wonderful illustrations. Robert Lawson is a genius of catching the most adorable expressions and humourus faces. My daughter (3yrs) LOVES this book too. WE HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was one of my very favorite books as a child. Parents with young children would do well to read this book to them. It is the story of a young bull (Ferdinand) who learns to stay true to his own unique self. While all the other bulls all want to be mean and fierce, Ferdinand instead is a gentle and loving soul. Yet the situation comes where people try to force Ferdinand to comply. Ferdinand is taken to fight in the bull fights! Will he be faithful to himself, or will he go along with the crowds? Yes, there are deep morality questions and ethics here) Indeed, both parents and children will be touched by the timeless message of hope and strength that is Ferdinand. It truly is a book that children need to know and model."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Four words best discribe this wonderful book and they are peace, contentment, pacifist, and priorities. And in a day and age of school shootings I wonder what would happen if we made sure this book was read by all children and then discussed.It is a wonderful book for teaching that some creatures including some people are peaceful and do not need much less seek fights. That when we are &quot;stung&quot; we may get mad but that we do not need to take it to the next step where we hurt, harm or kill. That we all have tempers but that we also can learn to make wise choices and develop sound priorities.The book is interesting because it does teach something about the culture or history of bull fighting, as well as the fact that just because something has always been done doesn't mean it should or need continue.I would caution that this is a book that a parent/caregiver needs to not just read but also discuss. Children may have some serious questions about bull fighting and the whole kill and die aspect. Just because a book has a good ending etc doesn't mean that questions in the middle of the book are not still there, and need to be answered."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Originally published in 1936, this simple story of the pacifist bull still rings true for children and adults, as ferdinand refuses to fight even when he is chosen to face the matador in Madrid. Ferdinand would rather sit under a tree and smell the flowers, and his mom thinks that's just fine. this is a comforting story for kids who feel they don't fit in. the message is simple and direct, and makes for great discussions after reading.

Just an all around pleasure to read."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I grew up reading this book over and over. Now my children are old enough to enjoy this heartwarming story that reinforces the importance of individuality. Basically, it showed me that it's ok to be different some times.

It helps me find the tranquility within."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I have been reading this book to my 4 month old. The drawings are great and the story is so sweet. I only hope that he can hate violence as much as Ferdinand does.

Your child will love Ferdinand!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Beautifully crafted, delightful drawings. Really draws on the ideas of empathy and making peace - so, in more than one sense, a story for our times. I was read this as a two or three year old and have never forgotten it (over 50 later). I'm now buying it for presents for all two year olds I meet!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is the story of a little bull named Ferdinand who did not cavort and butt heads and bellow like the other little bulls but sat under his favorite cork tree. When the men came to select bulls for the honor of appearing in the great ring, he would have been passed over, had he not accidentally sat on a bee, after which he bellowed and charged and ran as no bull had before. And so off he went in a cart to Seville----and what happened next has engaged children for over 70 years.\\"Ferdinand the Bull\\" is thus old but in no way dated. It is a forever story for at least three reasons:--the story reads aloud beautifully--the illsutrations are vivid with personality and expression and detail including the marvelous individuation of the picadors marching into the ring--the tale itself has drama, excitement, and makes even more excitable little ones think about smelling the flowersA perfect gift for any child---actually for every child---and this edition is a splendid value, an almost exact reproduction even to the colors of the original. Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Like all great pieces of classical children's literature; and make no mistake, \`Ferdinand' is a classic by any definition of the term, ten people can simultaneously read the work and the same ten people, when finished, will come away with ten different lessons, and glean ten different bits of wisdom...all from the same story! There are so very many levels and angles this little story can be viewed from.....It should be remembered that this book was published at the eve of the horrible Spanish Civil War. It should also be remembered that it was published at the same time Earnest Hemingway was publishing his work addressing bullfighting and the ultra macho culture he expounded. Hemingway, in his own way was defining the qualities expected in all males and was actually quite successful at it as his writing influenced an entire generation in one way or another. As you read the story of Ferdinand you cannot help but wonder if the author, Munro Leaf and the illustrator, Robert Lawson had an agenda of their own. I personally feel they did - taking a shot at Hemingway not being the least. But of course that is pure speculation on my part and as I indicated above; others will come up with a different take after reading the book. This is good.The story of Ferdinand is pretty well known by this time. It is the tale of a bull that did not want to behave stereotypically as bulls are suppose to behave. He simply did not want to fight. As one reviewer in this forum has so well said, \\"Ferdinand is the kind of character that if they gave a war, he simply would not show up.\\" I liked that. And the key here is that despite of everything, Ferdinand stuck to his guns - his principles. Ferdinand was a pacifist to say the least. He followed his own drummer and did his own thing despite the pressures placed upon him to do other wise. Now I am not what you would call a pacifist by any means, but I most certainly respect those who are; those that don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk.No, this supposedly ferocious bull much preferred smelling flowers under a tree and thinking thoughts that peaceful bulls think.The illustrations in this book are sort of a work of genius. We have a case here were the author made the illustrator and the illustrator made the author...there is simply no other way to put it. The illustrations are in black and white - we are talking the book here, not the Disney film, and are quite clever. The picture of the cork tree with corks hanging on it is often used to illustrate the sneaky quirkiness of the artist, and rightfully so, but I find the presentation of the portrayal of the matadors hilarious preening and the wretched condition of the Banderilleros as the enter the ring on their exhausted horses speaking volumes as well as the portrayal of the proud Picadores that have broken lances (Adults will delight in the imagery here - the symbolism), and again, exhausted horses. (You must remember that on a personal basis, I am extremely anti bull fighting and supposedly cultural icon or not, a barbaric practice that should never have survived into the 19th century...but hey, that is just me).We of course, if you think about it, find that this work examines the way humans use animals and the way men, boy and indeed bulls are suppose to act. Is suppose, for me, the overriding message in this little work is that a person should \\"do their own thing\\" and not worry all that much over the expectations of others - i.e. our society; being an individual can often times be the right thing to do.There are good reasons why this book has stayed in continuous print since 1936 and is still a favorite among children and indeed, adults.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I purchased this book as a Valentine's Day gift for my 6 year old daughter.

Although she is now 25, she still loves it. A wonderful tale of a bull that doesn't want to follow in the footsteps of his bullfighting elders and friends, even though he is the biggest bull around. Ferdinand follows his heart, and follows it to a peaceful place that is very appealing in a society that often pushes younger children to follow the crowd. A timeless tale!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"The Story of Ferdinand is a fun story about a bull who refuses to fight.

The message is not simply one of peace and commitment to an ideal, but also one of basic karma, existentialist philosophy of choice and responsibility, and the need for all to follow the Golden Rule.The Story of Ferdinand lets children know it is okay to stay true to their characters, and will encourage them to think their way out of situations, rather than muscle their way out. Ferdinand's peaceful and contented nature is something all human beings should all aspire to.Having been stung by many bees in my youth, mainly while traipsing barefoot through clover and accidentally stepping on them, I have great sympathy for our hero and the situation he finds himself in. The realization that even small events and actions can have a tremendous impact on our lives, and everything else that surrounds us in this world, is beautifully presented in this story. How Ferdinand chooses to deal with his plight at being taken away to fight is, of course, the heart and significance of this tale. His choice of poetic action is a perfect lesson in morality and provides the lasting appeal for this book.I recommend this classic for all ages and peoples, especially in our troubled times. It has a wonderful philosophy of life message; and even if readers choose not to apply the lesson to real life, the charming tale of Ferdinand is worth reading simply for its power to delight and entertain.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a great tale of morality which encourages children to be themselves.

The prose is almost poetic and the black and white illustrations are entertaining. I've read that Munro Leaf was so inspired by the idea that he wrote the book in one sitting.

Ferdinand the bull just loves to sit and smell the flowers, but is pressured to become a champion fighting bull. In the end, he remains true to himself.

Instead, \\"he like[s] to sit just quietly and smell the flowers.\\" But one day, when five men come to his pasture to choose a bull for the bullfight, Ferdinand sits on a bee, provoking him to act so crazy that the men choose him for the next bullfight. When he arrives in the arena, he has to decide whether he will give in to the pressure to perform.The story is rendered in charming ink drawings and is exceptionally well written. The author makes gentle fun of the strutting bravado displayed by of the bullfight's participants, while Ferdinand's gentle response displays a unique kind of courage. Some parents will see this story as a treatise against the violence and cruelty of bullfights, while others will view it as an example of someone being true to himself. However you interpret it, this is an undeniably hilarious story that has been loved by children since its first publication in 1936.It is fairly accessible to older toddlers and will also be enjoyed by early readers. Since its original printing, a color version has become available, but some of the pictures are missing, and the blotchy quality obscures the detail in the ink drawings, so I prefer the black-and-white version."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Bought the book for the head of our maintenance crew ... who's name is ...

Youch!As much as I love the book, it does leave off the horrid reality about bullfighting, how bulls are tortured and killed. As a kids' book, maybe it shouldn't, but hopefully, children get fooled into thinking bullfighting is just a game.

This approach is a *whole* lot better than &quot;The definitive guide to Citrix MetaFrame XP&quot; E-book, which starts writing about pricing from page 2 or so, without any introduction into the thin client computing world.Chapter 6 and 7 (70 pages in total) focus on the Citrix planning phase (where to put the zone data collector, which database product to pick, migration paths, machine scaling, physical drive layout suggestions etc.), which is very useful material for people involved in Citrix projects, managers as well as technicians.Chapter 8 goes deeper into the actual installation of Citrix. From that moment on, a more or less modular approach is taken. You can freely skip chapters, since all are self-containing. Only very important things are repeated throughout the book (not copied, like Hipson's &quot;Mastering the Windows 2000 Registry&quot;). All necessary things a Citrix admin should know are then covered in a single chapter (TS user configuration options, Terminal Server connections, Deploying RDP and ICA clients, Security etc.).Chapter 21, Performance tuning and Resource Management, is a gem. As many SQL administrators know, performance tuning can be hard. Many practical performance testing highlights and hints for performance increase are provided though that can be put into practise almost immediately. The tips that are given can be divided into three broad groups:- known tuning methods (disable graphically intense screensavers, clean the Run registry key as much as possible)- lesser-known tuning methods (disable Office background grammar checking, disable Dr. Watson logging)- &quot;unknown&quot; tuning methods (disable paging out the Executive OS components)In the meanwhile, references are given to third party tools and web sites, so users can delve further into certain practical and theoretical aspects of MS/ Citrix XP.The author is short and consise when he needs to be (excellent top 10 lists about issues that are covered at the end of many chapters), and takes a more elaborate approach when necessary (such as when describing the loopback processing mode and possible licensing issues).IMHO two things can be improved:- More screenshots wouldn't have hurt. I had to write down the book's page number, and check out the setting at work the next day. This is not a big issue though.- There are some annoying typos which could have been prevented easily (HKEY_KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE really should be spotted). This is also a minor issue.All in all, this is a wonderful book. Technically accurate, easy to read, and serves as a good reference."},{"Title":"Inside Citrix MetaFrame XP: A System Administrator's Guide to Citrix MetaFrame XP/1.8 and Windows Terminal Services (2nd Edition)","review":"Very detailed information and easy to follow.

I bought this and one other Citrix reference book when I needed to design and install a 3-server farm -- the other one (\\"Configuring Citrix Metaframe XP for Windows\\"; Broomes, Khnaser, Crump and Craft; Syngress; 2002) was useless. However, this book gave excellent structure to the entire process, almost like a good cookbook.The first half of the book is about analysis, design, and installation. The second half is about fine-tuning and adding some of the more esoteric features that Citrix offers.The 2002 edition that I have was written for Windows 2000 Server, but I found that it was easy to adjust to Windows Server 2003. There may be new editions for 2003 now, I am not sure.The writing is clear and concise, with ample illustrations and screen shots. The author exhibits a dry and intelligent sense of humor that makes the book rather entertaining to read. Let's face it; it's not exactly the most entertaining material. But short chapters, with embedded checklists and summaries, make it easier to digest, without the distracting air of a \\"dummies\\" book.Why only 4 stars when the book was so useful to me? The subtitle of the book is \\"A System Administrator's Guide to Citrix Metaframe XP/1.8 and Windows Terminal Services\\", and I simply don't consider it to be a good administrator's guide, in the traditional sense. There is a ton of good information in here, but it's not laid out in classic reference style; the structure is A) planning and installation, and B) fine-tuning. So in that sense, I consider it more of an installer's reference than an administrator's guide. But I should point out that the chapter on Citrix and Microsoft licensing is the best I've ever read, simply for explaining what you need to buy (tough combinations), when to activate it, and what happens when you don't, and why.I hope this review helps you as much as this book helped me."},{"Title":"Inside Citrix MetaFrame XP: A System Administrator's Guide to Citrix MetaFrame XP/1.8 and Windows Terminal Services (2nd Edition)","review":"Book is interesting to read. Interesting facts and HOWTO's above citrix and terminal services"},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"I bought this book when it first came out, and read the whole thing in about two days. I found it fascinating and was unable to put it down. Yet there is just so much information in this book I felt overwhelmed after reading it so quickly, so I'm not sure that is the best way to read it.The book is very thorough, almost panoramic. It begins by rooting the Medjugorje phenomenon in Bosnian history, Church history and the conditions in the town of Medjugorje during the 1970's. It then discusses the events of June 1981, the earliest apparitions and how the Franciscans became involved. It goes on to cover the worldwide Medjugorje movement and many of the questionable characters involved in or tangentally related to it. The stories of couples and families torn apart by false seers and manipulative members of the movement are positively heartbreaking, even terrifying.The writing style is uneven; Jones has some interesting little &quot;catch phrases&quot; which he repeats over and over again throughout the book. For instance, regarding how the war in Bosnia effected pilgrimages to Medjugorje, he is fond of saying that the pilgrims were left &quot;all dressed up with no place to go&quot;. So fond, in fact, that he repeats that phrase about three or four times throughout the book! It was cute the first time, but pretty soon gets tiresome.He does the same with a few other phrases, giving the impression that this book may have been compiled from disparate works written over time. That could account for the repetition. IMHO, a writer should be careful not to repeat himself like that, since his readers will find it tiresome.My copy of the book contains numerous typos; of course, I purchased the first edition, so he may have corrected it since (I think he has changed the title as well). The typos give the further impression that the book was released quickly, without sufficient proofreading.I also wish Jones would have presented all the events of June 1981 a bit more systematically - day by day, hour by hour - so I could see how the Medjugorje phenomenon developed in the very beginning. I found that chapter a bit scatter-shot, though it did contain much information I had never heard before.A reveiwer below cited the &quot;guilt by association&quot;. Yes, Jones is guilty of that in this book. He goes to great lengths toward the end showing the problems with aspects of the Medjugorje movement: false seers, shady characters, cultlike manipulation, broken families, mishandling of donations, etc. etc. While this is all horrific and disturbing, it does not *in itself* prove that Medjugorje is false. Questionable characters have attached themselves to valid Marian apparitions (Fr. Gruner and Fatima, for instance), and false religious movements have grown from them as well (the Apostles of Infinite Love in Canada claim to be following the instructions of Our Lady of LaSalette). But that does not invalidate these apparitions.I do not believe that Medjugorje is a valid apparition, but IMHO the corruption in elements of the Medjugorje movement could well be quite separate from the falsehood of the apparition itself. I say that *after* reading this book; I don't think Jones quite succeeded in proving a connection between the two. Guilt by association is not always convincing.Even though the connection is not clear, this book still presents enough damaging evidence against the apparition itself to convince an orthodox Catholic that Medjugorje is false, provided they are not already partial to the apparition. I have read books both pro and con, and this one is by far the most thorough and convincing, even despite the rambling, repetition and &quot;guilt by association&quot;.One last thing; I did not appreciate how Jones characterized Pope John Paul II as an &quot;apparitions nut&quot;. I believe he was quoting someone else who said that, but he could have printed a disclaimer had he disagreed, and he did not print one. A little respect for the Holy Father, please!Anyway, I recommend the book to anyone who is really interested in the aspects of the Medjugorje phenomenon which supporters will not present. But try to pace yourself when reading it; there's a lot of meat in this book, so give yourself time to chew on and digest it all! And be prepared for some heartbreaking stories of broken marriages and cultic manipulation. This book may well change the way you think about Marian apparitions. If its cautionary tales keep people from credulous acceptance of every self-proclaimed &quot;seer&quot; who comes along, it will have accomplished much."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"After reading the negative reviews posted on Amazon, I approached this book with some misgivings, expecting it to be an unbalanced and vicious denouncement of the Medjugorje phenomenon. I was surprised by the objectivity shown by E. Michael Jones in this very thorough examination of events. Although the author does not repeat the well-known details surrounding the origin of the apparitions, he does attempt to respond to the many unanswered questions that continue to plague those troubled by the myriad of contradictions involved with this false apparition, such as why it has never been unambiguously condemned by the Catholic Church, in spite of messages that are an outright contradiction of Holy Scripture. Why does no one know about or heed the ruling and warning given by the Yugoslavian Bishops' Conference of 1991? E. Michael Jones gives an explanation for one of the most complicated situations in the history of humanity.As someone who is acquainted with many people who have suffered deeply from the cult-like nature of Medjugorje (broken families, suicides, and lost faith), I found it refreshing to find confirmation for what I already know: Medjugorje is a creation of evil, designed to divide and conquer the pious. As Fr. Philip Pavich says on p. 351, \\"If I were Satan, this is how I would get at the pious. Take something that is not only not on the level of divine revelation, but a lie as well, and then get all these pious people to promote it to the status of a divine oracle, and then get them to clobber the fellow who disagrees, even the bishop, get these seemingly pious people to offend against charity by attacking anyone who wants to preserve the integrity of divine revelation. The devil gets the pious to tell anyone who disagrees with them, 'You're doing Satan's work by opposing me.' This is the essence of schism.\\" How true! This is the heart of the Medjugorje phenomenon, with all the characteristics of a true cult. There is very simply no other explanation for how people who fast and pray can accept the lies being propagated by the so-called visionaries. Medjugorje people are an entity unto themselves, and their very insistence that one must believe in these messages to be saved is a contradiction of Jesus' good news of salvation.E. Michael Jones, far from being an \\"irresponsible journalist,\\" is the most responsible kind there is. He is someone who has the courage to oppose the status quo by presenting a true, although unpopular, exposition of the corruption behind one of the most far-reaching and destructive religious events in history. It is not surprising that he has suffered as a consequence, and that there are so few on his side. It is not possible to oppose the forces of evil without suffering the consequences, evidenced by the continued loyalty of the visionaries to an apparition that they by now know is evil. I applaud E. Michael Jones for his incredible courage. Those who care about eternal life rather than the fleeting pleasures of this world would do well to listen to the truth."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"Jones is very accurate. Contrary to a couple of previous reviewers Medjugorje HAS NOT been approved as an accepted apparition. Mr. Jones with his previous books has accurately pointed out the contradictions involved with these \\"seers\\". The Roman Catholic Church will NEVER rule on an ongoing alleged \\"vision\\". The Bishop of the diocese in which Medjugorje resides has issued at least two opinions that these are false visions and that the Blessed Mother is NOT making appearances in Medjugorje.In 1997 one of the \\"visionaries\\" claimed in 2000 there would be a public vision for \\"all the world to see\\". 2000 came and went.These men and women are no longer children. And I find myself curious as to where all the money that these \\"visions\\" has generated has gone.These men and women say good things and inspire people to turn to the Lord. It's possible the Blessed Mother appeared to them as children. But unfortunately over 25 years it becomes very difficult to keep the story straight.I thank Mr. Jones for staying on top of this all these years and working to make sure that the unanswered questions and contradictions see the light of day."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"I have no stake in Medjugorje. I'm Catholic. I've read up on apparitions. I've visited shrines. Medjugorje is a highly contested \\"apparition\\". I've read all about it.Because Medjugorje is so scandalous, I decided to read this book. My friend, a Catholic who visited the place twice, loaned me her copy.First, the copious typos make it hard to focus on the text. A proofreader is needed ASAP.Second, there is a lot of uncalled for attacks on various people. Labelling the seers' families as \\"somewhat dysfunctional\\" is unfair. (And even if their families are \\"somewhat dysfunctional\\", would such dysfunctions exclude them from having visions.) Calling Pope John Paul II an \\"apparitions nut\\" is just so juvenile and random. Yes, the Pope credited Fatima with saving his life after the assassination attempt. But does that make him some sort of fanatic? I don't think so! The author comes down hard on EWTN's Mother Angelica, simply because she promoted Medjugorje in the late 80's and early 90's! EWTN no longer promotes the \\"apparition\\", and in fact, its library has a document about the problems with Medjugorje.The seers are made out to be back-asswards types living in an equally back-assward part of Yugoslavia. Weren't Fatima's Lucia and her two cousins considered \\"simple\\"? Lourdes' Bernadette was \\"simple-minded?\\" Why pick on the Yugoslavian seers?Don't think that religious people are the only ones who get insulted. Ronald Reagan is wrapped up in the author's conspiracy theories. Reagan and the Pope worked together to bring down Communism. (Is that such a bad thing? Reagan is hailed as one of the greatest presidents in history precisely because he was able to bring down the Iron Curtain!)YES, there have been lots of frauds associated with Medjugorje. They are the ones who are doing the deceiving. Is this any fault of the seers? No! It's the fault of the authorities who might be manipulating the seers. And it's the fault of the frauds themselves. I'm glad the author mentioned the problems with Theresa Lopez and Vassula Ryden, esp. Vassula because her \\"ministry\\" is still very popular, despite it being unapproved.The history of Yugoslavia is included, and that was an interesting read.The author comes down pretty hard on the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, and I can't blame him. There's lots of odd stuff in that movement.Still, I'm glad I didn't purchase this book. It would have been a waste of money. I'm sorry my friend wasted her money on it. You can get the pros and cons of Medjugorje online. I'd recommend doing that, and then waiting for the Vatican's final decision.BTW, Medjugorje was disapproved by their local bishop sometime in the 80's. That should speak for itself!"},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"Mike Jones, editor of Culture Wars magazine, goes deep into the events surrounding the purported Marian apparitions at Medjugorje to show how lives have been ruined, families torn asunder, lies have spread, and ethnic and religous communities rendered, all in the name of peace. Must reading for anyone intersted in Medjugorje or friendly with anyone swept up in its vortex."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"A friend and I were asked to review this book for a magazine, but could not stomach it long enough to actually write the review.E. Michael Jones is one of the most irresponsible and illogical &quot;journalists&quot; in the world of Catholic publishing.Over the course of reading the book, a careful reader can't help but notice that the anecdotes are just sort of strung together, giving a less cautious reader the hazy sense that they might be connected. They rarely are. Jones wants to create the impression that a deception is taking place, but he can't seem to muster anything resembling solid, documented facts or reasonable arguments.Jones' worst tactic, used almost continuously throughout this book, is a form of ad hominem which I will call &quot;guilt by association.&quot; Here's how it works. Jones wants to discredit person X and his ideas. Person Y, a different individual, acts in a morally questionable or immoral manner. So Jones informs his readers that X and Y are acquainted, and may even be on friendly terms with each other. Jones uses the acquaintance of X and Y to assume that both people are morally corrupt and that the ideas of X are thoroughly tainted and unacceptable. Jones does not bother prove that X has done anything of which Y is guilty. Association is enough for Jones to discredit X.Of course, consistent application of the &quot;guilt by association&quot; argument would discredit Christ Himself.Allow me to close with this: I don't have any stake in whether or not the Medjugorje visionaries are legit. I've never visited the place, I've never read any of the so-called revelations, I've never read any books supporting or defending the so-called visionaries, and it probably won't change my life one bit when the Catholic Church finally says they're real or fake. My only concern is that E. Michael Jones' arguments and methods of argument are very nearly worthless, and people should not read him uncritically."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"The Medjugorje story is one that is fascinating because searching for the truth always is. This book tells the other side of the story, one I haven't seen anywhere else. The only disappointment was that there wasn't more focus on the seers themselves, like why Jakov left two seminaries. The hunger for signs - visible manifestations of the divine - is one that is old as history and won't go away but might be approached more cautiously after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"Sure Medjugorje has attracted some quite unsavoury adherents; particularly the American 'Medjugorje Mafia'.

There is a large amount of factual error in this investigation.There are some downright malicious allegations made against many of those whose have been positively inspirational - in particular Father Jozo Zofko.The dignity and integrity of the visionaries themselves acts as a counterbalance to some of the appalling claims in this sad and at times pathetic attempt to demolish Medjugorje.James Mulligan"},{"Title":"The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives","review":"The book seems bent on giving information that is not factual and twists the messages around to make them seem inconsistent with church teaching. When doing research on the actual messages in Medjugorje, they are consistent with Church teaching. The official ruling of the church states that Medjugorje is a Holy place and a Shrine. That should be good enough for anyone. Since the church has been studying Medjugorje and the messages, if there were anything wrong with the messages, it would have been condemned a long time ago as was bayside."},{"Title":"Determinants and Matrices","review":"An important reference as early source of some important results in linear algebra.

This work is a systematic approach to the ecclesiological and eschatological structures of the Catholic and Protestant Church.Hans Kung is an engaging writer who treats each subject with care and meticulous scholarly research. Protestant readers should not be put off by Kungs Catholic background, as Kung is fair and insightful in his critique of both Church traditions.Although 'The Church' is a scholarly publication written by one of the most innovative and clever theologians in modern history, 'The Church' is remarkable engaging and easy to read, despite its considerable length. This book is suited to both Church leaders and the layperson who are seeking a concise study of the nature and purpose of the Church."},{"Title":"The church","review":"There is no denying that \\"The Church\\" is a child of its time. Released in 1967 just two years after Vatican II, this signature work of Hans Kung was succeeded by a string of critical and controversial ecclesiastical works by its author. In the years immediately succeeding its publication, \\"The Church\\" played its role in the anguished debate over the very nature of Catholicism in the postmodern world.But this is now over four decades in the past. Those who used this text in ecclesial and university battles are now for the most part long retired or even deceased. Battle lines are still drawn, but the map looks strangely different. The question that remains now is whether removed from its post-conciliar setting, \\"The Church\\" has an enduring value, something to say that remains fresh in the contemporary setting.I finished rereading this book almost a year ago, and I wrestled with that thought myself until I came across the excellent collection of essays entitled \\"Vatican II: Did Anything Happen?\\" [2007] This is a wonderful and spirited defense of the necessity of the Council. It was inspired, I believe, by a tendency in the Vatican today to act and speak as if the great Council was a momentary blip that changed little. In point of fact, however, Vatican II was a moral necessity, given that Roman Catholicism and its sister communions had been utterly powerless in the face of the grotesque evils of two world wars and the Holocaust.Kung's work, like that of other war generation Catholic theologians of Western Europe, is a vision of a Church that indeed would have the moral credibility of character before the powers of this world. There is some striking similarity between Kung's methodology and that of Karl Barth several decades earlier; both define contemporary Christian experience as the outflow of the arrival of the Reign of God. The Church is nothing more and nothing less than the community of those who accept the Reign of God and gather to celebrate this wondrous overturning of history. Membership in the Reign of God is a dramatic, life altering decision. As Kung himself would remark in a later work, Christianity is the only world religion that calls its members to become like unto God.Kung's sources for the nature, mission, and structure of the Church are primarily scriptural, though as we shall see, Kung's use of the New Testament in particular is at times eccentric. It is not that he did not have other sources, for it is easy to forget over time that Kung was as thorough a scholastic as Karl Rahner, and his footnotes are as multiple and sweeping as those of the Theological Investigations of Father Rahner himself. It is also a reflection of that time that, if memory serves me correctly, English references are rare and American references nonexistent.Kung finds the New Testament not only a Rosetta Stone for deciphering the Kingdom, but also a kind of family history of the Reign's organic unfolding. He tends to contrast the freedom of the Pauline churches to experience the Holy Spirit in charismatic and unstructured ways, against the churches of the so-called Pastoral Letters where history and lines of authority are more clearly defined. While he can hardly deny the validity of such developments, clearly Kung wishes that there was room today for the Pauline vision of ecclesiology.Certainly an area of particular interest is the papacy. Kung examines Matthew 16 in contrast to Matthew 18. Both speak of the authority of the reign of God to forgive sin, though in the former chapter this power is personified in Peter, while in the latter the forgiving authority is a broader family power. Kung, of course, has never made a secret of his concern over papal centralization. In this work, he does allow that the historic Apostolic Succession has in its own way been a blessing for the Church, but I would not exactly call it a ringing endorsement, either.It hardly needs to be said that Kung's is a utopian view of the Church, but then one could say that the Vatican II documents themselves talk about the Church in this way. It may be that this radical freshness and pristine purity found in much of the Council's official language stands as a stark contrast to what actually was then and is now. There is much to the arguments of O'Malley, Schloesser, Komonchak and Ormerod in last year's publication cited above that the Church, almost unconsciously, must in this present day seek to minimize Vatican II as just another of the twenty-one councils to avoid a profound institutional schizophrenia.The graves of the millions who died in the 20th century carnage are witness to the fact that no church council of that century could ever be seen as \\"business as usual.\\" This, I think, is what those with long memories understand as the \\"Spirit of Vatican II\\" (a term, sadly, hijacked by the Council's enemies unhappy with parochial excesses.) It is the mind frame of the post-World War II era that brings such an edge to the writings of Kung, including our work at hand. It is the reason why \\"The Church\\" needs to remain on bookshelves, so that future generations will remember a day when the Church, its bishops and its theologians, came together in collective shame and guilt but nurtured by a pontiff of extraordinary hope and determination, to begin again at square one. Hans Kung and other participants of the Council did not seek to dismantle the Church but to rediscover it. \\"The Church\\" remains as one of the critical road maps of their quest...and hopefully, of ours."},{"Title":"The church","review":"The Church is not any building. The Church is not even any particular institutional structure imitating past secular structures such as the monarchical or the imperial.As this excellent and approved book presents: Our Church is the Pilgrim People of God. Our Church is the unfolding, on-going creation of the Holy Spirit. Our Church is the Mystical Body of Christ.In this scholarly, well-researched and considered tome (My Image Book reprint of 1976 covers 655 very full pages), Professor, Theologian and Catholic Priest, the Reverend Father Hans Kung explores the Bibilical essence of Church and how our post-conciliar ecclesiology may more honestly and integrally recapture that essence and Holy Spirit of God which entered through the window flung open by good Pope John XXIII at the beginning of his Ecumenical Council.It goes without saying that this book bears the Nihil Obstat (Nothing Obstructs its publication doctrinally nor morally) of the learned Doctor of Theology and of Legal Studies John Barton, Censor, as well of course as the IMPRIMATUR ordering its publication by the Vicar General of Westminister. It is in fact dedicated in the post-Conciliar ecumenical spirit to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Michael Ramsey. The search for ecumenism and the unity of our Faith was once a goal set by the Second Vatican Council.The great Catholic Priest and Bibilcal Scholar Fr. Robert McAfee Brown endorses this important work with these words (which I quote in part): \\"Kung's most significant and enduring work thus far, which is saying a lot ( . . .). 'The Church' seems to me destined to become the work from which both Catholics and Protestants will begin new formulations of a doctrine of the church.\\"Fr. MacAfee Brown is of course the famous mainstream Catholic scholar whom we must thank for such important works asSpeaking of Christianity: Practical Compassion, Social Justice, and Other Wonders.Further endorsement falls from the learned pen of the famous Father Avery Dulles, brother of John Foster, etc., who writes: \\"'The Church' is a very important and valuable book. It brings together an almost unbelieveable amount of exegetical and historical information, and effectively shows its bearing on the renewal of the Church today. Kung is profoundly committed to the renewal of the Church according to the Gospel. This authentic evangelical motif should make this book as appealing to Protestants as it is necessary to Catholics.\\"The orthodoxy of the theologian, professor and Reverend Father Dulles, later Cardinal, falls far beyond question, and his endorsement of this great book must bear much weight. Father Dulles wrote a good number of accepted texts, including the influentialModels of the Churchas well as several lesser known works includingModels of Revelation. Also \\"necesssary to Catholics\\" seriously seeking a deeper understanding of our Faith is hisThe Craft of Theology: From Symbol to System. See also his important work for the Woodstock Theological Institute.This profound and lengthy work, therefore, by Professor, theologian, Doctor of Theology, Doctor of Law, Doctor of Humanities, and Reverend Father Kung, bearing these bright shields of Imprimatur, Nihil Obstat and the public endorsements of at least two well-resepcted colleagues, presents his comprehensive examination of the nature and meaning of Church.He begins in section A by explaining the authentic esence and image of the Church, and the distortions of that Image. Section B explores the most exciting aspect for me: The ministry of Jesus, and his preaching the message of the reign of God. Notice throughout the use of the rather generic term Reign rather than the specific Kingdom of God, as the latter term imposes a secular misconception and distortion which is not found in translations of the Our Father, for instance, in tongues other than English: Adveniat regnum tuum, and might therefore more faithfully transmit the original sense of Jesus's preaching and teaching and mission.We then consider with Father Kung the foundation of the Church, the nearness of the reign, which remains already yet not yet, reminiscent of Saint Bernard's famous formulation of the soul seeking God in love, whom it already possesses. Then we enter the apostolic era of the earliest Church, which is compared with the reign of God. We see the ekklesia as congregation, community and Church, and how we serve.Section C explores various aspects of the Church structure, as People of God, as a Creation of the Spirit, and as Body of Christ. Section D presents Dimensions of the Church, its unity in diversity, its catholic (universal) identity, which causes some to declare no salvation outside the Church, a question Father Kung dares explore. He continues his examination of contradictions and paradoxes by showing the Church both sinful yet Holy, and how the dynamics of forgiveness and renewal maintain the vitality of our pilgrim Church. He finishes this rather Credo section with a treatise on apostolic succession. His final section looks at the offices of the Church with Christ as High Priest in whom we all share, the nature of ministerial service in the Church, and the meanings of the Petrine ministry. A summary epilogue concludes this great work, followed by a number of indices by scriptural reference, by name and by subject.Anyone interested in gaining a greater understanding of the nature and history of our Church must read this book, which strongly deserves an easily accessible spot on your reference shelf, bearing as it does so many endorsements, including by the officials of our Church. This book may be happily supplemented by his later work:The Catholic Church: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)"},{"Title":"The church","review":"Hans K&uuml;ng (born 1928) is a Swiss Catholic priest, theologian, and author, who was famously censured by the Vatican in 1979 (seeKung in Conflict,The New Inquisition?

It is not the so-called 'Catholic Church' which is remarkable for its extreme narrowness?\\" (Pg. 403)He observes that as \\"direct witnesses and messengers of the risen Lord, the apostles have no successors.\\" Apostleship \\"died out with the death of the last apostle.\\" (Pg. 456) He deplores that some readers in reading a book simply look to see if the writer is \\"for\\" or \\"against\\" the pope, and judge the entire work based on this one question. (Pg. 566-567) Nevertheless, he argues that \\"the ministerial principle of a single person is not contrary to Scripture.\\" (Pg. 589)Not too long after this book, he wroteInfallible?: An inquiry, and his path as an \\"outside\\" figure was begun. But this book is still fascinating as an illustration of the \\"progressive\\" direction that was NOT taken after Vatican II."},{"Title":"The Dreams in the Witch House: And Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Following a fascinating introduction by editor S. T. Joshi, the contents of the book are these tales:PolarisThe Doom That Came to SarnathThe Terrible Old ManThe TreeThe Cats of UltharFrom BeyondThe Nameless CityThe Moon-BogThe Other GodsHypnosThe Lurking FearThe UnnamableThe Shunned HouseThe Horror at Red-HookIn the VaultThe Strange High House in the MistThe Dream-Quest of Unknown KadathThe Silver KeyThrough the Gates of the Silver KeyThe Dreams in the Witch HouseThe Shadow Out of Time.I chided S. T., at last year's WFC, for naming this book after what he thinks of as one of Lovecraft's worst stories. I guess he likes the title more than ye actual tale itself. He writes of it, in his notes: \\"'The Dreams in the Witch House' was written in February, 1932. HPL's working title was 'The Dreams of Walter Gilman,.' Stung by the rejection of AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS by Fanrsworth Wright of WEIRD TALES the previous summer, HPL refused to submit the tale to Wright, but August Derleth, in spite of his low opinion of the story (see HPL to Derleth, June 6, 1932: 'your reaction to my poor \\"Dreams in the Witch House\\" is, in kind, about what I expected--although I hardly thought the miserable mess was QUITE as bad as you found it.\\" ...submitted it to Wright without HPL's knowledge or permission; it was accepted, appearing in WEIRD TALES for July 1833.\\"The story is, as Fritz Leiber has demonstrated, HPL's ultimate modernization of a conventional myth (in this case, witchcraft) by means of modern science. Leiber notes that it is 'Lovecraft's most carefully worked out story of hyperspace-travel. Here (1) a rational foundation for such travel is set up; (2) hyperspace is visualized; and (3) a trigger for such travel is devised.' Nevertheless, the tale suffers from plot holes and florid prose and cannot be ranked among his better later efforts.\\"Perhaps. The one very curious matter to me is the conventional treatment of Nyarlathotep as the Black Man of Witches Sabot lore. This dark lord, this Crawling Chaos, is such a rich and wonderful creation that I loathed to see Him treated so clumsily in this story, where he has a mere walk-on role that adds nothing to plot structure or atmosphere.Some of these tales are called Lovecraft's \\"Dreamland\\" stories, although only two or three of them actually occur within the Dreamlands -- the most interesting and delightful of which is the short novel, \\"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,\\" which Lovecraft never revised for publication (it was left, unpublished, in manuscript at the time of his death, as was \\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\"). Here we have two tales set in mist-soaked Kingsport -- my favourite Lovecraftian town -- the racist \\"The Terrible Old Man\\" and the so peculiar \\"The Strange High-House in the Mist.\\" \\"The Doom That Came to Sarnath\\" has the distinction of inspiring Brian Lumley to pen one of his interesting and entertaining Lovecraftian novellas (\\"Beneath the Moors, if memory serves right). \\"The Nameless City\\" is minor Lovecraft, and yet I find the story fascinating and return to it often. It was never professionally published in HPL's lifetime. I love the Gothic atmosphere of \\"The Unnamable,\\" atmosphere that one also finds in such stories as \\"The Hound\\" and \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter.\\" \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\" is a story that Lovecraft wrote in collaboration with E. Hoffmann Price -- I find it mildly interesting. The outre clock described in the story has also been used heavily by Brian Lumley, especially in his Mythos novel THE TRANSITION OF TITUS CROW.But this book is important in that this was the first collection of Lovecraft's work to include the corrected text of what is considered by many to be Lovecraft's supreme masterpiece, \\"The Shadow Out of Time.\\" The original manuscript, long thought lost, had been given to Barlow -- and it was found some years ago and sent to John Hay Library, where the core of Lovecraft's papers are preserved. S. T. Joshi worked on deciphering the text, with the assistance of David E. Schultz, and the corrected text was published as a single edition by Hippocampus Press. Its inclusion here is the tale's first appearance in a Lovecraft collection. It is a haunting tale, especially spooky.I love the annotations of the three Penguin Classics editions. They help to tell the tale of the histories of the writing of these tales, using quotations from HPL's vast correspondence, detailing when and under what circumstances the tales were written, &c; &c.; Here is S. T.'s fascinating note concerning the \\"minor\\" tale, \\"The Unnamable\\":Written in September 1923, \\"The Unnamable\\" first appeared in WEIRD TALES (July 1925). It is less a story than a fictional treatise on supernatural horror--specifically on stolid bourgeois unresponsiveness to the weird tale. As such it bears comparison with the IN DEFENSE OF DAGON essay of 1921...,where HPL first defended his brand of weird fiction as appealing only to \\"a very limited section of the public\\"....The story represents the first of several reprisals of the character of Randolph Carter, who first appeared in \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" (1919) and would return to experience adventures in dreamland in THE DREAM-QUEST OF UNKNOWN KADATH and its sequels. Carter's antagonist, Joel Manton, is clearly based upon his longtime friend Maurice W. Moe..., although the name may come either from a character named Manton in Ambrose Bierce's \\"The Middle Toe of the Right Foot\\" or from Manton Street in Providence. The story also explores the sense of lurking horror in New England history and topography, a dominant topos in HPL's later work. Influences on the tale may include the work of Arthur Machen..., especially the episodic novel THE THREE IMPOSTORS (1895), which features two characters debating at length on the nature of the supernatural, as well as Bierce's \\"The Suitable Surroundings\\" (in TALES OF SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS, 1891), in which a writer challenges his friend to read his horror tale under the \\"suitable surroundings\\" of a haunted house at night.Joshi has worked so diligently to give us Lovecraft's texts as H. P. Lovecraft wrote them and wished them to be preserved. Remember HPL's letter to his first editor at WEIRD TALES:\\"My Dear Sir: Having a habit of writing weird, macabre, and fantastic stories for my own amusement, I have lately been simultaneously hounded by nearly a dozen well-meaning friends into deciding to submit a few of these Gothic horrors to your newly-founded periodical. ...Of these the first two are probably the best. If they be unsatisfactory, the rest need not be read. ...I have no idea that these things will be found suitable, for I pay no attention to the demands of commercial writing. My object is such pleasure as I can obtain from the creation of certain bizarre pictures, situations, or atmospheric effects; and the only reader I hold in mind is myself.My models are invariably the older writers, especially Poe, who has been my favorite literary figure since early childhood. Should any miracle impel you to consider the publication of my tales, I have but one condition to offer: and that is that no excisions be made. If the tale cannot be printed as it is written, down to the very last semicolon and comma, it must gracefully accept rejection.\\"It was this kind of thing that drove HPL's first biographer, L. Sprague de Camp, bonkers:\\"Lovecraft had done everything to assure rejection of his stories: the haughty tone, the art-for-art's sake pose, the deprecation of his own work, and the mention of a previous rejection.\\" Poor de Camp; he, along with his buddy Lin Carter thought that Lovecraft's striving to write Literary Art was a foolish and pretentious \\"pose\\" -- and yet it was Lovecraft's striving for excellence in his writing that has assured his solid place in American Literature, with the publication of TALES from The Library of America. These clueless and ignorant critics cannot recognize sincerity in genre artists, which I find very strange and very sad. Thankfully, in S. T. Joshi Lovecraft has found the editor who realises his serious artistic intentions, and who has restored Lovecraft's texts \\"down to the very last semicolon and comma\\"; & thus S. T. has given us the corrected Lovecraft texts, beautifully publish'd in these fabulous editions from Penguin Classics. Superb!"},{"Title":"The Dreams in the Witch House: And Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Having read the two previous collections it was a logical step to go on and get the third (and apparently final)one. So what to expect with this book? Some really good stuff and some really bad stuff (my opinion).Various kinds of stories are gathered here, as was the case with the previous publications by Penguin; that is, there are some \\"macabre tales\\", \\"dreams and fantasies tales\\" and some \\"Great Old Ones tales\\".\\"Polaris\\", the first story, really gave me a bad impression. It's a short piece but its worthiness is just as short. The second tale is not great either. Fortunately this goes up with the third \\"The Terrible Old Man,\\" though it's nothing properly astounding.One of the biggest stories in this collection (100 pages or so), namely \\"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\\" is the only Lovecraft story I did not finish after having started it. But this one is just too much. It's a dream tale, lots of beautiful imagery with flowery descriptions, weird names of people and towns and god knows what else, etc... etc... The problem is that its length is way too much for a tale of that kind. The fact that it's all a dream completely kills any kind of suspence or tension or expections: in a world where cats can jump off roofs to go behind the moon to gather is a world where you expect absolutely anything. And that's where the weak spot is. If anything can happen then you're just expecting anything and whatever happens is not surprising. So that is not your usual Lovecraft story; but I expect some readers may like that kind of thing; it's not bad it's just so incredibly long that in the end the potential power of such a tale is flattened entirely because of its unfit length and crowding stuff. I only read half of it but after that my interest was so lacking that I just found it useless to go, besides I had lost the thread of what was going on.I would say this collection is slightly weaker than the two first ones. It's still worth getting if you like Lovecraft. I was just a bit disappointed by some stories in there that are really weak. Yet there are also some good surprises: \\"The Nameless City\\", a kind of pre-At the Mountains of Madness is a very interesting story; \\"In the Vault\\", however simple and classical it is, still is a pretty good tale.I'd recommend you check out \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" if you have never read any Lovecraft before and are interested in doing so. Otherwise this book is worth getting (even if some tales do suck).PS: the footnotes and individual presentations on each story is as always very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"The Dreams in the Witch House: And Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"While reading the penguin omnibus *The Call of Cthulhu* a few years back - my first foray into the Cyclopedean mnemonic-Coliseum of H. P. Lovecraft's oeuvre - it felt as if I were perusing fragments of a much larger cosmology, hinted glimpses of nightmarish mythology, an intuition given credence by the continual reference in the footnotes to other stories, most notably \`The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath.' As Lovecraft's work is usually self-contained, I continued through that first volume and the follow-up, *The Thing on the Doorstep*, and the gaps in my conception began to slowly and surely bridge together, fashioning an overall portrait of cosmic horror and lurking fear, gallows-humor and existential doom, all woven together by Lovecraft's gloriously-florid prose. Yet it wasn't until I held this volume, *The Dreams in the Witch House,* that I realized here was compiled at last the keystone and map to the underpinnings of the Cthulhu Mythos... and I recall, upon reading the first half-dozen stories, a sense of irritation, having just completed the Conan stores by Lovecraft's contemporary Robert E. Howard, recently published in their original forms and chronological order; why, I wondered, with the numerous printings of Lovecraft's horror throughout the decades, had a similar treatment not been done? *Dreams in the Witch House* spans the creative arch from the halcyon-phase of 1919 to very near the end, Lovecraft's second-to-last story \`The Shadow Out of Time' (1935). I surmised that if Penguin and the editor S. T. Joshi had compiled Lovecraft's oeuvre in a chronological fashion, then all that mystery, all that tension-filled \`unknown' from the first and second volume, could have been expanded, given a richer foundation.Not until I delved deeper into this third (and, I presume, last) Penguin edition that the slow realization as to the particular compilation came forth. *Dreams in the Witch House* is unlike its predecessors in several ways, most notably that it contains the bulk of Lovecraft's more fantastical stories, \`tone poems' of a mythology that expanded over the course of a pulp-fiction career, with the style differing from the \`standard Lovecraft' treatment - in that, a first person narrative of mortal man stumbling upon the secrets to a vaster and inhumanly horrific universe, and the consequences that ensue from these visions of the Void. Although these \`standard' stories filter throughout *Dreams in the Witch House*, around half the book is devoted to the more fantastic imagery inspired by the work of Lord Dunsany, and even the regular stories contain hints or progress themes from this concentrated legendry.Therein lay the quandary, at least for this reader. Lovecraft's gift for horror lay in his hinting at the hideous and horrific, a struggling-obtuse framework for that beyond human conception; due to the writer's refined technique, this usually imparted both a growing tension and curiosity as to the mystery presented. Even when maddeningly diffuse, Lovecraft managed to reveal just enough to satisfy and stimulate, to give shape in the reader's head of the daemonic reality, despite his protagonist's oft-whimpered reluctance to reveal concise detail. That was Lovecraft's genius - in showing not enough, but just the right amount - a literary technique by and large failed by his predecessors and that, in this day and age of shock n' draung, seems downright antiquated. Yet for me it is the hint that haunts the most, as I find most modern horror with non-psychological basis a paltry swine-trough for necronerds and the emotionally stunted, a tawdry romp within the confines of Western culture's death-fixation through violence and adolescent revenge wish-fulfillment (the slasher/gore genre in general).So - with the revelations of this volume - a mythology that grows through \`The Doom that Came to Sarnath', \`The Cats of Ulthar,' \`The Nameless City', \`The Unnamable' - and culminates with \`The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath' - I found the magic dissipated with revelation, the climax of so much sinister suggestion found somewhat lacking in a mythos-construct eerily resembling a macabre Oz. Not to say I didn't enjoy \`Dream-Quest' or its related stories in this realm-within-a-realm; I generally enjoyed every story of the three Penguin collections, ever-stirred by Lovecraft's prose and resultant imagery. This was simply a case of shattered illusions, the Pandora's Box opened to personal regretIt came clear by the end of *Dreams in the Witch House* that this collection contained a stronger thematic development than the previous two compilations, with the developmental flow between \`Unknown Kadath', \`The Silver Key' and the inferior follow-up \`Through the Gates of the Silver Key' into \`The Shadow Out of Time' - with nearly ten years separating this last from the former entries - giving a sense of apotheosis to Lovecraft's \`Cluthu Mythos'. And it is this final story that, for me, seems to represent the absolute best of the author's work. Although the structure is very similar to \`At the Mountains of Madness,' the concluding novella \`The Shadow Out of Time' begins with an overview of the dimensional / space-time theme and progresses into an evocative yarn of alien-haunted beauty, disturbing in a sense that few of Lovecraft's tales managed to impart on this reader.At last I understood Joshi & Penguin's intent in combining the more mythical and fantastic elements of Lovecraft's work into a concluding volume. Although the first two compilations can be considered more necessary in terms of story-craft and classical status, *The Dreams in the Witch House* nicely dovetails these two volumes and, in its own way, explains all. Venture with caution, however, lest you wish those illusions - of fitful mortal explorations into alien cosmology, of the delight in the horror of the unknown - revealed and subsequently shattered.Also, a note: the cover is similar yet different than that presented above. Curious..."},{"Title":"The Dreams in the Witch House: And Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"This third collection of Lovecraft stories from Penguin Classics contains some excellent material, including \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\" and \\"The Shadow Out of Time,\\" but many of these stories are not among Lovecraft's most impressive work. The editorial apparatus supplied by S. T. Joshi doesn't really help much either. Most of Joshi's notes, for example, consist of factoids and tidbits of information with very little critical insight. This is typical of Joshi's editorial work for Penguin Classics (see his unimpressive work with Algernon Blackwood and M. R. James especially) and it does no favors to the material. One might compare China Mieville's far more exciting and insightful introduction to the Modern Library Classics edition of Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness--Mieville offers a helpful appraisal of Lovecraft's style and thematic concerns; Joshi offers information with no critical filter. Lovecraft deserves serious attention as a major writer of horror and science fiction. The uneven quality of the fiction included here and the fannish style of its editor unfortunately are not a positive step in this direction."},{"Title":"The Dreams in the Witch House: And Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Well, it's Lovecraft... what more is there to say?If you're thinking of buying this book, you should first of all go and read a few of his Cthulhu mythos stories, to see if you can stand the over-written, artificially archaic style that Lovecraft often uses.As for the \\"horror\\" in Lovecraft's writing, you need to provide much of it yourself. Lovecraft probably uses the terms \\"unnamable\\" and \\"indescribable\\" more than any other adjective. (OK, so maybe he uses \\"carven\\" and \\"graven\\" too much, but that is in the category \\"artificial archaism\\".) Though in one story, Lovecraft takes a refreshingly self-mocking look at his writing style, where a writer of pulp horror has a conversation with an old friend and schoolmaster.I would not recommend this book to readers under 20 years of age. Not because it is too scary, but because I think that teenagers will probably find this book dull.Joshi's notes are complete and very helpful in most cases, especially those explaining how Lovecraft used names and personality traits of friends, relatives and historical figures, and how he based his fictional towns and houses on real sites.However, they sometimes become tedious when explaining simple references between one story and another (to The Cats of Ulthar, mentioned in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath).The most annoying, in a book like this, are the typos. There are not very many, but still three before page 100 in a book of this age (i.e., that was typeset long ago, and has had time to be corrected) is sloppy.

Also the chapters on Campaigns are very very good (to me, better than the ES book on this aspect). I actually won a few campaigns using the guidance of this book that I can't win before. If you are starting as a single player and want to win the campaigns, I recommend this book.

I would, nevertheless, encourage this book for players who plan to play this game online against other people. In truth, the single-player campaign strategy is top-notch as well, but the key differentiating factor between this book and the others is that is was written entirely by on-line real-time strategy players and experts.Section 3 on Civilizations, Section 4 on game features, Section 5 on Advanced Unit Control, and Sections 6 through 9 on planning, building, defending, and expanding your empire are all really crucial for someone who is good versus the computer to read BEFORE venturing onto the internet and feeling like a deer stuck in the headlights on an oncoming battering ram.Most good single-player players do not realize the enormous chasm between expert at single player and intermediate at multi-player in skills. Playing versus other players is the only way to make the leap, but this book helps that transition.Even Chapter 11, on multiplayer etiquette is a must read for the online neophyte.On the other hand, if you yourself are a top-100 player, this book is more interesting as a snapshot of ThumP, Methos, et al.'s thinking as the game was released. The downside, is of course, that strategy thinking evolves. When the book was written, for example, Teutons were thought to be a very good civilization, but with sufficient weakenesses to keep them balanced. Now, most games ban the Teutons b/c their TCs are too strong. This book notes the TC strength but publishing deadlines prevent it from discussing the next two months of game evolution.All strategy books should come with a free &quot;tune up&quot; addendum online, three to six months after release.I'd give this book 5 stars if it had that feature, but otherwise, no written computer-strategy book can ever learn more than 4 in an online world.Andy &quot;AndyHRE&quot; Schwarz, contributing writer"},{"Title":"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings: Prima's Unauthorized Strategy Guide","review":"I received the book through Air Mail three days ago and I just began reading yesterday, but I already recommend it.

There is great insight on what Christians were doing and how the Church developed in Africa, the Middle East, and most amazingly in Asia. As a Seminary student, it was refreshing to read about the diversity and globalness of the Christian faith. The book makes a strong defense on how Christianity is a global developement and that it is more than just a Westernized Religion. As an American Christian, I think this book gives a valuable perspective that challenges us to look at the Church and its past in a new light.

I also appreciate the clarity of expression, making this an easy page-turner. The material both strengthened my faith and raised challenges for reflection. For this, I heartily recommend it.That said, I hope that for the next edition, that the authors get an editor: material gets repeated, sometimes almost verbatim between sections; there are distracting spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The repeats mean that the reader can use the book as a rapid reference aid for open book tests, which I appreciate, but some might find it off-putting.Finally, although I found the drawing out of the heroines of the faith to be quite helpful and eye-opening (example: that Jerome's woman colleagues probably had a larger hand in the Vulgate translation than heretofore imagined), at times this felt like a feminist affirmative action program.That said, I commend the book to all with curiosity about just how broad the world Christian movement has been through history."},{"Title":"History of the World Christian Movement: Earliest Christianity to 1453","review":"This book was the first required reading for my \\"foundations of church history\\" course in a theological studies master's program at University of Dayton.

The authors collaborated with a wide range of different \\"flavors\\" of scholars in the text's creation. Furthermore, the authors also include the experience of women in their text in such a way that it both gives voice to ancient women without overwhelming the entire narrative. However, Catholic readers should note that this text is written by Evangelical authors, and thus their understanding of ecclesiology is radically different from what Catholics and Mainline Protestants may be used to. For example, the authors make very little use of the word \\"church\\" - it hard exists in the text! Christianity instead is seen as a movement (not that there's anything wrong with that). Furthermore, the authors note their surprise at the fact that there are relatively very few first hand accounts of conversion from the first century...something that may be disconcerting if one's understanding of Christianity is based on personal, defined experiences of conversion.

Authors take readers beyond political, cultural, and geographic perspectives of fundamental Christian history. This work makes a strong defense for Sanneh&#8217;s theory of &#8216;Christian translatability across cultures&#8217; that Christianity is a global development and not just as a European arm. In this work the authors have recognized women&#8217;s involvement and contribution in the entire process of Christian expansion, which is an encouraging aspect for women in missionary enterprise. Women have played a vital role in the translation work (Vulgate) than people would generally imagine.Reading through the book one may notice redundant verbatim between sections, which is not bad (maybe, more beneficial for non-western readers to keep themselves on track). The authors also draw conclusions at the end of each chapter which help readers on the story line.

It looks promising at the outset because of the large number of scholars who have contributed to the book. It incorporates scholars from different cultures and institutions to attempt to bring together an ecumenical view of Church History. Unfortunately that goal is never achieved. The book wanders aimlessly through church history, never clearly identifying what time period they're trying to cover and making much of what they're trying to present incoherent. This is mostly likely the result of so many different voices trying to get a say. There are better church history overviews, such as Justo Gonzalez's two volume \\"Story of Christianity.\\" There are some good sections here and there, such as the section on Islam, but this is a book better left on the shelf."},{"Title":"History of the World Christian Movement: Earliest Christianity to 1453","review":"I received the book within 2 days of purchase and it was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"History of the World Christian Movement: Earliest Christianity to 1453","review":"Dale Irvin and Scott Sunquist's History Of The World Christian Movement presents an introductory volume which covers earliest Christianity to 1453.

I was left feeling that I knew Mr. Goodwin, and contemplated finding him and making him my husband, primarily so we could travel together."},{"Title":"Gunpowder Gardens","review":"This book is WONDERFUL! Be forewarned, however: you WILL begin to guzzle litre after litre of tea during the reading of this book. Mr. Goodwin gives an absolutely wonderful first-person account of his often hilarious travels investigating the tea trade, from its' beginnings in Canton to the present day. A MUST for anyone who loves tea - and I'd rate Mr. Goodwin's writing style on a par with Pico Iyer's. A good read, full of humour and information..."},{"Title":"Gunpowder Gardens","review":"This book was also published in paperback in the United States under the title A Time for Tea: Travels Through China and India in Search of Tea (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991). Informed and entertaining, the book is a combination travelogue-history; the author visits China, India, and a few other tea-related places (Boston, as in Tea Party), all the while telling us how tea is grown, processed, and drunk; how it was first discovered; and how it came to be exported to the West. I found it totally engrossing. Had it been written by an American, I would class it in the category of New-Yorker-style writing: intelligent, witty, light - yet informative. I suppose the book may now be out of print in the American version, but it's certainly worth tracking down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gunpowder Gardens","review":"A Time for Tea: Travels through China and India in search of teaJason Goodwin, 1991Where's the Tea? 2*I enjoyed one of Jason Goodwin's more recent books, 2006's mystery novel \\"The Janissary Tree,\\" even giving it a 5* review. A little dry in the writing, perhaps, but with interestingly presented historical background, sort of a travelogue to a different time as well as place. So I was primed to enjoy Goodwin's 1991 actual travel book, especially since I am a tea enthusiast of long standing and it is subtitled \\"... in search of tea.\\" It is hard to come across good information not filtered through merchants' catalogs and websites, and I was looking for some boots on the ground reporting on how the teas are grown, manufactured and enjoyed in these major tea growing regions, and some good information on the teas themselves and their varieties.Sadly, I am frankly puzzled by the previous Amazon reviews of this book. I'm at page 125 (out of 272) and have just encountered the first substantive mention of tea ... and it's not the author's own experience of tea, or new information that he has uncovered about tea, but extracts from the collection of aging references he just now tells us he has been carrying around with him.And this is another problem I have with the book -- it's almost half way through that we find Goodwin has actually done some prior research, possibly extensive, on the subject. Up until now it seemed that he had simply inhaled a typical Brit's knowledge of tea along with his mother's stewed cuppa, and set off as a classic Innocent, a blank slate in search of illumination. Similarly, it is also nearly half way through that we find he reads and writes Chinese and speaks one dialect (though he doesn't mention which), almost as an aside when he is describing how speakers of mutually unintelligible dialects can still communicate in written Chinese (which is why, incidentally, Chinese movies often have Chinese subtitles).I'm not even that interested in the tea trade per se, especially the trade of centuries gone by (though I'm sure the subject has its own fascination), but the tea itself. Unfortunately, the historical tea trade seems to be what the author is keenest on, the minutae of the grading systems of centuries gone by (and not actually telling us how the teas were graded, but merely standing in awe of the number of potentially distinguishable grades), rather than distractions such as what the bloody brew tastes like. I get no feel for the actual experience of drinking, tasting, tea until the very end of his travels, on p. 255, where he describes the tasting of a fine Darjeeling.OK, so it's not primarily a book about tea, but how accurate and deep is the odd spot of actual information about tea itself? Following the comment of a previous reviewer, I looked up Lapsang Souchong in the index, and before even getting to the Lapsang specifics in the referenced pages found this: \\"Grading tea [into uniform sizes by sieving] is done partly to improve the appearance ... and partly to offer a range of liquoring speeds: the smaller the leaf , the quicker it brews.\\" (p.166) Well, appearance is a matter of aesthetics, and finer leaf teas do brew more quickly, but it's not as if there's a huge demand for 2 minute vs. 4 minute brewing cycles. Rather, having tea of uniform leaf size ensures that it brews evenly, that fine particles don't overbrew before the coarser leaves release their flavor. And the Lapsang specifics a bit later consisted of the astounding revelation that it is indeed smoked (after \\"fermentation\\", actually oxidation, a process common to all black teas). I wonder what the heck the reviewer told her Irishman that is not common knowledge? Much of the other information he provides (mostly culled from his traveling library) is questionable, incomplete, or at least no longer applicable. These from pp. 123-125:-- \\"We [westerners] judge [tea] by the colour of the dry leaf, rather than the colour of the liquor in the cup. Some teas we would call green give 'red' liquors.\\" Maybe true of centuries gone by, but the black / green divide these days seems entirely based on fermentation (oxidation) or lack thereof, not leaf color. \\"Black\\" Darjeelings are often (where appropriate) described as having a green leaf. I have never heard of a \\"green\\" tea with a red liquor. Maybe he's thinking of the Chinese description of what we would call \\"black\\" tea as \\"red\\" tea, based on the color of the infusion of at last some black/red teas.-- He describes gunpowder tea but doesn't mention why the leaves are rolled tightly (to preserve freshness).-- \\"Formosa Oolongs are more black than green.\\" Actually Taiwan (Formosa) produces a full range of \\"fermentations\\" (oxidations). The \\"greener,\\" lightly fermented, varieties appear to be more popular there, although the typical export \\"Formosa Oolong\\" is the more oxidized version.The author does provide an interesting description of tea manufacture in Darjeeling, at least some from first hand observation (pp. 217-219) and of the various seasons of Darj teas (219-222), first and second flushes, autumnal teas (though I would not agree with his source's characterization of first flush teas as inferior -- I've found myself favoring them as my appreciation of Darjeeling increases). But by now we're a bit gun shy. How much is unique to the estate he visited, how much common practice throughout? (And what about the green and oolong Darjeelings, admittedly uncommon?) How much, perhaps, even gleaned from Colonel Money's famous 1877 essay \\"Cultivation of Tea\\" which he references?In summary, if you hope to learn a book's-worth about tea itself, or how it is grown and processed, you will probably be disappointed, as I was. I did skim and sample the rest of the book as well, and there's just not that much tea there.But to be fair, A Time for Tea is also billed as \\"Travels through India and China ..,\\" so how does it stack up as simply a travel book? Alas, it's not a style I'm particularly fond of. The language and attitude are quintessentially Brit, and it mixes an odd assortment of historical, cultural and geograpical factoids and opinions with his actual experiences and observations. And somehow his initial hiding -- or should we just say de-emphasis? -- of his preparation, research and linguistic skills seems a cheat, or at least gives a wrong impression of his expedition. Perhaps it's that I was looking for something else, but even as a travel book it doesn't grab me, although from my sampling it does pick up in the India section. Your mileage may vary."},{"Title":"Gunpowder Gardens","review":"Goodwin takes us on a journey of exploration, history, geography, social life and tea-drinking in all the right places. I've been a full-time tea-drinker since I was weaned as a baby in the UK and have learned more about tea from this book than I ever thought I wanted or needed to know. The author writes in such a way that the whole book and his journey, become a live instruction in the countries, lives and producers of tea, while making it all so pleasurable that one hardly thinks of the lessons being imparted at the same time as participating in his adventures.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in tea, whether as a beverage of choice, a lesson in the economics or social and cultural studies of the indigenous populations of the tea-producing countries...or just for the fun of it all."},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"Life is tough if you're immortal. That seems to be the general message of Rumiko Takahashi's Mermaid Saga, starting off with &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest.&quot; It's creepy, dramatic, and after reading it, you may never look at a mermaid picture the same way again.In the first story, a strange young man named Yuta is travelling through Japan. He's one of the few human beings who has eaten the flesh of a mermaid and become immortal -- most of them die or turn into monstrous &quot;lost souls.&quot; He finds a mysterious village made up of vicious old women -- and a young girl named Mana, who has been made into an immortal without her knowledge.Then it's flashback time, to Yuta's encounter with a young pirate girl named Rin several centuries in the past -- and a strange woman who wants the mermaid flesh for a mysterious reason. In the present, Mana and Yuta are taken captive by a white-haired young woman, who has been fed mermaid's blood -- and now she wants to switch bodies with Mana.Takahashi clamps down on her humorous style in &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest.&quot; There's no pratfall humor, cute characters, or funny scenarios involving alcohol, nudity or magic spells. There's blood, amphibious &quot;lost souls,&quot; some very nasty revenge plotting -- oh yes, and mermaids who make barracudas look cuddly.And Takahashi weaves in some rather melancholy material about immortality. Sure, most people think it would be fun to live forever, but Yuta reveals that his wife aged and died while he stayed the same, and he tells Mana not to adopt a kitten because it will only die on her. And the romantic involvement with Rin is clearly doomed from the start, since Yuta would outlive her as well.Mana and Yuta are a lot like Takahashi's other lead couples -- they start off on shaky ground, since Mana is basically a spoiled teenage brat, and Yuta is much older, with a lifetime of sorrow behind him. And her supporting characters are astoundingly vivid, like the ruthless land mermaid, or the old/young woman who was fed mermaid's blood.Rumiko Takahashi strays into darker waters with &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest,&quot; an imaginative and suspenseful dark fantasy collection. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"Men and women seek out the flesh of mermaids because it is said that if you eat it, you will be granted immortality. Of course, what they don't know is that there is also a chance of instant death, or even worse, of being changed into a horrible ghoul. Yuta learned this centuries ago when he and some of his fellow fisherman, curious to see if the legends were true, decided to eat the flesh of a mermaid. While some of his comrades died instantly, others changed into soulless beasts. Only Yuta was given the gift or curse of eternal life. Yuta doesn't want it. He wants to grow old and die like normal people. So he sets out on a quest to find more mermaids because he has been told that only a mermaid can reveal to him how he can become a mortal man again.During his wanderings he comes upon a village of murderous old hags who seem to have mermaids living among them. You see, they can also change into human form and walk on land. He learns that they are keeping a young girl named Mana imprisoned there her whole life and have fed her mermaid flesh for some dark reason, making her immortal too. It's up to Yuta to figure out some way to save both their lives.The second story in the book is a flashback to an earlier period in Yuta's life when he encounters some bloodthirsty pirates out to catch a mermaid for the sly wife of their chief. Left for dead, Yuta is found by a rival but much more civilized pirate clan and a love story develops between him and their defacto female leader.The last story in the volume, &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot; takes us back to contemporary times with Yuta and Mana. Mana, not knowing about automobiles and such because she has been a captive all her life, walks in front of a truck and is taken in by a nefarious doctor in the employ of a family who owns &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot;, on whose grounds, a mermaid is alleged to be buried.This was a very well-written manga. I wouldn't say it was for kids because it has a lot of gore and more than a little nudity. There's a thread of sadness through the storyline when you realize that Yuta and Mana are truly alone in the world. I don't really get Yuta though. He has a chance to stay with the queen of the pirates but refuses simply because he doesn't want to settle down in one place. If he lives forever, what's wrong with living out a life with someone you love? This manga had a lot of elements to it: horror, love story, and adventure. Be warned that Volume 1 does leave you hanging at the end on a cliffhanger.I would also recommend Highlander on dvd. Also, similar themes are dealt with in Interview With a Vampire novel and movie."},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"I have no idea why I skipped over this manga. I love all of Rumiko Takahashi's titles, but the one she created as a \\"hobby\\"--Mermaid Saga--is the only one I missed. It is a very sad story--basically, it's a tale of love, immortality, and of course, adventure. Consuming the flesh of a mermaid grants eternal life, but being alive forever can be a blessing or a curse. Immortal lovers Yuta and Mana have been alive for a very long time, but neither wished for this--in fact, they both wish to die a normal, natural death. Becasue of this, they are both searching for the mermaids because there is a rumor that only the mermaids know how to reverse the immortality spell upon their victims. This is a good story, and the art is simple, yet lovely. However, if you don't like horor (-ish) stories with more than a little bit of romance, (or you arn't a fan of Rumiko Takahasi) then don't read it."},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"Mermaid Saga is something I've been longing to read since I first saw reviews for &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot;. Now, the reason I had not already purchased it is because I didn't have it in my area, and I didn't feal like ordering from Amazon so, I waited patiently and Viz republished it!!!Now, I AM VERY familiar with Rumiko Takahashi, but I have NEVER actually read her work, not to say I haven't wanted to, other things have just topped my list lately. But this was one of the things that topped my list, so as soon as I knew it was republished, I bought it. I know enough about Takahashi to know that she normally does humorous things, like &quot;Ramna 1/2&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. But even though this is quite serious, it is a very intriguing, unique, and engross tale of immortality.This story follows a man(Yuta) and a young woman(Manna). Both of them have eaten the flesh of a mermaid in there life. Which in this, if you have EXTREME luck, gives you the &quot;gift&quot; of immortality. All others whom don't have the &quot;luck&quot;, either 1. turn into a &quot;lost soul&quot;(A hideous monster), or die(personally I'd rather die!!!). There are 3 stories in this one: Part 1 and 2 of &quot;The Mermaid Never Smiles&quot;(Where we first meet Yuta and Manna, and the mermaids/immortality), part 1 & 2 of &quot;The Village of the Fighting Fish&quot;(A story that tales of Yuta's past), and the 1st part of &quot;The Mermaid Forest&quot;(A story following Yuta and Manna after TMNS). All the stories have to do with the same people, but the second story is more of a back story, I think that one is probably my favorite, but all of them are awesome, and make me excited and impatient for the next volume!!!The art style is your classic Takahashi, but it is beautiful. I have come to appreciate and love her art style with &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot;. The translation, especially for Viz, is excellent. Not all of Viz's translations are bad, but they seem to hit or miss a lot. ;PSo, anyways, if you like Rumiko Takahashi, manga, or good stories in general(and don't mind some graphic violence), then you will undoubtedly enjoy this volume of &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot;.God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy"},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"I got hooked on Takahashi's work when I found Inuyasha (which, incidentally, is also the first anime series I followed). Just recently I found this earlier work of her's.It is fantastic! Her loose yet detailed drawing style is incredible. The story is magnificent (Even if it does bounce back and forth in time from one episode to the next.) Takahashi fans will love it. People who never heard of Takahashi will be drawn into the club.One thing for the uninitiated. These mermaids don't wear bikinis. So be prepared for quite a bit of upper-body nudity. Nothing that struck me as erotic or anything like that, but it is there.Oh, and the volume ends on a cliffhanger. Buy volume 2!"},{"Title":"Mermaid Saga, Vol. 1","review":"I've only read a few pages but this book is good.It is basically about Yuta a man that ate the flesh of a mermaid and is now immortal.In his quest to look for a mermaid,he meets Mana, a clueless but good looking chick with no idea that she ate the flesh because of an older woman gave it to her and claimed it was a new fish they brought in,that's all i've read for now!Don't miss out on a great book!!"},{"Title":"The Puritan twins,","review":"This edition in the Twins series was rather confrontational for me to read.

I can only guess that being in uncomfortably close contact w/ Koreans inside the prison and Thomas' relatively young age at the time (he was 23? or so?) allowed for that.On top of all that, I realized that that there is a connection between Cullen Thomas and myself.You see, after I got my MFA from NYU and had dug myself into a financial hole by making my 16mm feature film debut w/ FREE COUNTRY, I scrambled to find some source of employment and was hired as a staff writer for CURRENT BIOGRAPHY, a reference publication that's published out of a strange building in the Bronx, some 10 minutes away from Yankee Stadium.For the next several years, I'd trek to a cubicle in the Bronx and write 3-5 page bios of prominent people in the news based on newspaper clippings compiled for each person. It didn't pay much, but I got to read a lot of newspapers and actually learned a lot.I also stole time from my workday and started writing my first novel BOY GENIUS there in that little dark cubicle in a forgotten corner of the Bronx.Anyway, to make a long story short, it turns out that Thomas, too, had worked at CURRENT BIOGRAPHY as a staff writer after serving his 3.5 years and being sent back to the U.S.I have a hunch that Thomas was there just before or after my own tenure there. Who knows? Maybe he got the job that I left or vice-versa??Whatever the case, I've since written two novels and Cullen Thomas has published BROTHER ONE CELL.Kudos to him!!As for all those other aspiring writers out there, the lesson here is a simple one.Go to NYC.Go to the Bronx.Get a job as a staffwriter at CURRENT BIOGRAPHY.It's better than an MFA."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"Well worth the read. Its amazing how cruel and evil these overseas prisons can be. Cullen, I am so glad you made it home. I also watched the Locked up Abroad episode. If I had known you were there, I would have written to you to help you keep your spirits up and you are so lucky you have gotten to come home. I recommend this read to find out what is going on overseas in those prisons and I urge people to advocate for people who make mistakes and who are then treated so badly. Hash, big deal, here its a misdemeanor and no jail time unless high quantiies. Its grown and used over there so they can put ppl in prisons like Cullen. Its all a setup game for foreigners so they can extraxt money from us. Anytime a foreigner is caught and sent to an Asian prison they smile ear to ear because they know thier country will benefit from it somehow some way.Please read so we can advocate for better treatment on crimes committed overseas for our fellow americans. And Cullen stay in the US."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"First things first. If your name is listed in red ink, and almost everybody else's is in black, it does not mean that you've won a prize. Do not try to collect your package from the window. Cullen did and he wound up serving 3 and a half years in a series of Korean Houses of D.Ever since I read a Giant Robot article about Asian and Asian-American inmates stockpiling ramen, ketchup packets, soy sauce packets and other odds and ends to create ersatz versions of the dishes they craved, I've been fascinated with prisoner resourcefulness. In this respect Brother One Cell is a very satisfying travelogue. Cullen is a big, unseasoned foreigner, not yet fluent, completely inexperienced as a criminal, who must learn to survive as a prisoner - how to talk to people, how to make sure he gets his mail, how to deal with mosquitos, extreme cold and fluorescent lights that stay on 24 hours a day...Even more satisfying is the transformative mental and phillosophical journey upon which the author embarks, at first unconsciously and then with growing determination. The appreciation and grace at which he eventually arrives is a good reminder for those of us who've been spoiled by taken-for-granted freedom, cooshy living conditions and Get Out Of Jail Free cards we didn't necessarily deserve."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"This memoir succeeds because it taps a contemporary romantic vein. Indeed, Thomas describes how as a child he summons an archetype he calls the \\"Jolly Marauder\\"--the spirit of the adventurer. As an adult the call to adventure comes by way of a teaching job in Korea. The ensuing experience in a Confucian prison is refracted thus through the literate, 1st hand account of the Western individual.Where it succeeds is that true to its romantic impulse, the narrative doesn't simply rely on the stock plot of white boy in foreign jail. The narrator instead brings us to the place where the human spirit is pitted against the hard walls of the institution--it's socio-politically complicated, physically harrowing but ultimately a spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"This book is a must read, especially for all high school students and college kids to understand the full meaning behind, consequences of one's actions! Brother One Cell is a compelling tale of a young educated man who is wondering through Asia, in search of direction in life (which is very common for a young man having just graduated from college). Cullen makes a few reckless decisions that eventually place him inside the Korean penal system for 3 and 1/2 years. As you move from chapter to chapter the reader uncovers that Cullen's tale is not about being self-absored and angry about his current situation, but you experience the day to day life of an American living in the Korean prison systems with all of the confucian overtones that this new life encompasses. From having to learn the native language to having to play a brawl ball style of basketball for the Korean Gang sponsored teams, the reader retraces an experience that the author articulately shares with all of us. There is no glory in this story but it is a real story of life's ups and downs. The author walks you through a well written emotional tale that few Americans will ever experience. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"I read this book about 10 years after a friend of mine started teaching English in South Korea. In 2000 I went to visit him and met several of his friends who taught English there as well. You would be anazed at how many of these guys had mailed small amounts of marijuana leaf or hash to themselves. Nothing on the scale of what the author did, these guys were mailing themselves several grams not several pounds. But it made his story very real for me. When questioned most of these English teachers were so naive that they said that Korean Customs officials wouldn't know what has was if they saw it. Sounded like an excellent way to get deported.

Armed with an English major and big plans, Cullen took a job teaching English to school children in South Korea, quickly realizing that it was an insufferable grind. So he came up with a new plan: smuggling hashish into the country from Malaysia to finance a proper tour of the world. A friend had done it successfully, but Cullen got caught while collecting his contraband in the post office and was sent to prison for three and a half years. I've always been drawn to prison and war memoirs because they are like life only intensified, so you read looking for lessons about survival. Brother One Cell could be dark, but it is full of humor, poetry, and philosophy. From his cell window, Cullen could see a tree in the courtyard where he played basketball with murderers, thieves, drug dealers, and human traffickers. The tree kept getting cut down and down and down, but never lost its grace and dignity."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"I've learned so much from Cullen, for example: how to take one day at a time; also, what a satisfying exercise it is to wish for the happiness and joy of someone with whom you have a conflict. That is the ultimate forgiveness. Many other lessons come from this beautifully-written, amusing and (often) heartbreaking story. I wept when Cullen talked about lying down on the floor of his tiny cell and covered himself with fall leaves sent from home by his girlfriend. Congratulations to the author for a surprisingly mature and heartfelt memoir about a crushing event in his life. Amazingly, it not only left his soul intact, but created a spiritual master with the power to heal everyone who reads his book."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"The true value of this book is the insights that author Cullen Thomas offers into South Koreans and their unique culture.Cullen's story is also compelling, without any of the fluff and navel-gazing that is so often found within the pages of so many 'true life stories.' Even after being imprisoned in South Korea for nearly four years, he still regards his jailers in a positive light. He also readily admits to his guilt at the crime for which he was convicted.The one thing I found disturbing about Cullen's book was the fact that he was laboring on behalf of South Korean automakers while he was in prison, assembling circuit boards for dashboards. This doesn't seem quite right, although he bears no ill will towards anyone, and in fact, considered working to be something of a blessing, far preferable to being locked up in an isolation cell twenty-four hours a day."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"Another successful attempt at crowding five pounds of material into a ten pound bag.

I had to get it shipped to me here in Korea through a book importer. I couldn't wait for it to arrive because I was so impressed with the magazine article that I had high expectations for the book.My expectations were fully met. I've been interested in Korea for about seven years now, coming here twice as a student, and now living and working here while studying Korean. I've read several books about Korean culture, economy, etc, etc. None of the previous books I have read were able to paint such a vivid and profound picture of the culture I have come to love, in spite of its flaws.Somehow, by experiencing a side of the country that we rarely hear about, he is able to understand the essence of Korean society and illustrate it in ways that rang true with my own experiences while simultaneously shedding new light on aspects that I still struggle with. In particular, it was interesting reading this book while settling into a job as the only non-Korean full-time employee of a Korean company. Not that prison compares to company life in the least.This book is good on several levels. Other reviewers have already discussed the merits of the book as a memoir, etc, so I wanted to praise the book specifically as a book that relates to Korea, though perhaps not as many readers will be interested in this aspect of the book. I hope a Korean translation is released, because I think it would be an interesting perspective for Koreans to read about as well."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"Cullen Thomas writes a strangely affecting book about his time in Korea. He goes there as a typical young American, no goals, not exceedingly smart or particularly stupid. Just a nice kid, really. He makes the mistake of underestimating the Koreans and gets caught shipping hashish over international borders. Somehow, he thinks the Koreans should notice that he is really a nice kid and that he hasn't hurt anyone. He is so presumptious, naive, and condescending to the Koreans that it is staggering. He is honestly surprised when he is found guilty of doing exactly what he did (and actually is found guilty of a lesser charge of \\"using\\" rather than \\"selling\\"). His time in prison is fascinating as he meets many interesting people and finally comes to accept responsibility for his own fate. I rather admired the Koreans, who certainly have a better penal system than we do (given the opportunity to apply to serve his last year in the States, he doesn't want to).

To sum up just how that review errs, this book is not at all \\"uneventful\\"; the entire point of the memoir is just how humbled Thomas *did* feel by his experience; and while he does comment on ethnic diversity in the prison, he by no means sees his fellow convicts as \\"losers.\\" Please don't do yourself a disservice by assuming that this book is nothing more than some whiny, poorly adjusted, rich boy's lament.As for my own reactions to Brother One Cell, I feel that everyone can take something from it. While receiving a prison sentence is obviously no small deal, the appeal of this book is broader than many might assume. Some readers who never had to deal with a jail term may still find that it strikes a chord, have they ever found themselves faced with a prolonged set of difficult circumstances far away from home. The soul-searching that Thomas does, the way he articulates his pain over being kept apart from his loved ones, his insistence on \\"going it alone\\" despite his feelings of isolation, and his discussions of the fear of losing himself (on a fundamental and psychological level) are all of universal interest. He talks at length about the internal change that leads him to value the most mundane of acts -- things that he does not have in jail -- such as reading whatever he wants, looking at members of the opposite sex, walking around outside, and so much more.I feel that there are probably a number of people out there who could relate to the types of emotional and psychological changes explored and documented in this book. He even mentions (in varying amounts of detail) experiences such as phantom pains, flashbacks, and his unique relationship with Korea and feelings about the time he spent there. The author starts off by showing us the aimless vagabond he once was, allows us to accompany him very intimately through his periods of rage and depression following his arrest, and concludes with a sense that Korea is now very much a part of who he is.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the following-prison memoirs-unique glimpses into seldom-seen aspects of Korean culture-anyone familiar with Korean culture who is interested in outsiders' impressions of it-stories of self-discovery-culture shock-autobiographical accounts of the profound personal changes borne out of unrelenting hardships faced in relative isolation (as well as the changes in an individual's perspective on said hardships as time wears on)The latter reason to read this book appeals not only to those who have been forever changed by circumstances that their loved ones will never truly know, but it could also be of immense help to anyone trying to understand their loved one's experience and the depth of the impact it has left.Brother One Cell is fascinating--this book is raw, yet compassionate and, above all else, honest. Just as other reviewers have noted, I too can see this book taking a place on required reading lists; it is only a matter of time before it becomes a classic."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"The author of the Publisher's Weekly review seemingly didn't read the book in its entirety. In my opinion there is little except plot in that review that correctly addresses the book that I read. The last statement that Thomas was \\"unable or unwilling to be humbled by the experience\\" is amazingly off the mark.The book was so good I didn't want it to end - I tried to make the book last longer, and when it was done I wanted more. It's not \\"just another prison book\\", if there is such a category, but it's so reflective and uplifting and hopeful, not just for the incarcerated, but also for anyone who has faced persistent difficulties. Thomas experienced an initiation that he endured with grace. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"BROTHER ONE CELL is an extraordinary memoir ...The characters are complex, and the plot is both powerful and subtle. I can see this as required reading in high schools across the country. It is not only that good, it is that important. The writing is honest, straight forward, painfully introspective but never self pitying. I agree with the starred Booklist quote that Thomas had to overcome language barriers, unfamiliar foreign customs, extreme codes of social hierarchy, and almost no individual freedoms, \\"as well as his own personal demons, to get to a place of higher understanding--something that, amazingly, he seemed to accomplish.\\" The reviewer from Publisher's Weekly must have been reading a different book because he/she couldn't have been more wrong by saying that Thomas \\"is unable or unwilling to be humbled by the experience.\\"Equal parts heart-wrenching drama and heart-pounding suspense, this narrative unfolds in a way that is both achingly personal and overwhelmingly universal. Thomas is a complicated character, frustratingly naive at the beginning of his tale and enviously self-aware by the end of it. Like any twenty something searching for self, Thomas makes mistakes but unlike so many of us, his mistakes provide us all with a greater appreciation for freedom and beauty and one hell of a story."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"Loved this book. As a prison memoir, it does not shock or scare. Korean prisons, despite their lack of heat, cannot compete with Thai, Turkish or American prisons on the fear scale. This book delivers much more; it is the best that I have ever read on the subject of foreigners negotiating, stumbling, fubmbling and bumbling their way through South Korea. Thomas captures the maddening dualities, how he is constantly faced with both special treatment and petty humiliations. One minute, he is in awe of the maturity, cohesion, the genrosity, gentleness and, above all, the charm of Koreans. The next he is driven up the wall by their uniformity, closed-mindedness, bullying, brutality and pride. Every foreigner that has lived in Korea on Korea's terms has lived Thomas's story. Obviously, few have lived as much on Korea's terms as Thomas. And fewer still have written about the experience with more intelligence, even-handedness and wit.The most touching and disturbing part of the book deals with the author's friendship with a character identified only as Green. Green, married to a Korean prostitute, is serving time for murdering his own half-Korean children. Upon his parole, Green is deported and immediately relocates to Koreatown in Los Angeles, finding a home where outsiders are not supposed to have a place. Why would he choose to get as close as he possibly could to his former captors? After reading Thomas's extraordinary book, you will understand why."},{"Title":"Brother One Cell (Unabridged)","review":"This book is riveting.

Its a little bit different from your usual 'caucasion-gets-busted-for-drugs-in-asia-and-spends-time-in-hellhole-prison' book as the prison in South Korea is by no means as extreme as the ones you read about in Thailand etc.I kept turning the pages pretty easily with this book but the one gripe I have is that the author feels a need to constantly describe EVERYTHING in such intricate detail. For example he will walk into a room and before before you find out what is about to happen he will spend 3 pages detailing every little thing in that room: \\"and the smell is like this, and the sound is like that, and there was this on the floor which reminded me of this when I was a kid back home...\\" etc (that is not a real phrase from the book, just an example of course). I know that some people like this kind of stuff but it happens every page and I believe it gets in the way of the actual book itself.

It's not the greatest novel ever written; it's not even the greatest love story ever written, but there's just something so true & touching about the feelings it invokes.

In her \\"real\\" life, her marriage falls apart due to her husband's infidelity and she falls in love with Andrew Macdonald, the son of a man who was convicted of espionage with the Soviet Union in 1961. The novel's setting is thirty years later, and reading it today, parts of it are somewhat dated, but that doesn't spoil the dramatic effect. The time travel aspect is handled superbly. As mentioned, time-travel novels are not a favorite genre of mine, but I found this one is really superior in that way. This is one romance novel the reader can picture as a movie; it's vividly described. All the emotions are honest."},{"Title":"To Catch the Wind (Dreamspun)","review":"I've always loved books that include REAL historic information in the guise of a fictional story.

While an interesting period piece, it is not quite up to the standards he set in his earlier classics, such as \\"Lost Horizons\\" and \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\". However, it is still quite well-written and worth a read.\\"Time and Time Again\\" is the story of a modest 20th century hero - an ordinary man in the diplomatic service. Some of the chapters are titled 'nothing much to complain about', 'run of the mill', and so on. It's a story of the heart and mind of a very human man. With scenes ranging from Paris to Connecticut, London to South America, and bright with wit and incident by a master storyteller, it mounts to a startling, but credible, climax.If you are already an admirer of Hilton from his other works, you may find the subtler style of this work a little pedantic at first.

Such was the case with The Interventionist which is both a goldmine and a classic in one.If you work in a congregation, or are a congregational champion, one of the best things you can do is to buy multiple copies of this book. Keep two for yourself--a paperback copy to read and a hardback copy to save as a collector's item. Then give a copy to each key leader in your organization or active network.There are two reasons why you ought to invest in this book. First, it has an invaluable conceptual framework for doing church in a way that results in a vital congregational life. Second, it is the definitive work of Lyle Schaller in which he shares more than forty years of experience in congregational intervention.The key concept the book teaches is how to ask the right questions! For you the key question at this moment should be, how many copies of this book shall I buy?"},{"Title":"The Interventionist","review":"The InterVentionist is packed full of valuable information for anyone who is concerned about resolving problems within the church. Schaller examines issues and offers suggestions from the angle of the overall perspective, all the way down to detailed questions to ask in specific situations. Very thorough and realistic!"},{"Title":"The Interventionist","review":"Most of the reviews of this book were glowing and enthusiastic with praise. I felt differently about this book; I felt it had too much information and each chapter provides so many questions, sub-points, and issues; I felt overwhelmed reading the book.Here are the chapters of the book:Ch. 1 Who are the Interventionists?Ch. 2 What baggage do you carry?Ch. 3 Twelve Questions for the InterventionistCh. 4 What Do You Bring?Ch. 5 What does the Client Expect?Ch. 6 What are the Lines of Demarcation?Ch. 7 European or American?Ch. 8 Seventeen SyndromesCh. 9 What are the Central Organizing Principles?Ch. 10 Evangelism or Intervention?Ch. 11 Diagnostic QuestionsCh. 12 What Happened to the Context?A. Good PointsLyle Schaller draws from his extensive years in experience as an interventionist and parish consultant. He wrote this book for future pastors, or parish consultants who might need to serve as an interventionist for a church that is experiencing problems, decline in membership, or conflicts which negatively affect the effective ministry and growth of the church. The interventionist is a 3rd party consultant who comes into the church, gathers all the key leaders and influencers and asks them pertinent questions about their history, their vision, their organization of the ministry, the key roles of the leaders, and their decision-making about the ministry, about facilities, etc. that impact the church.3 of the most helpful chapters in this book to me were:Chapter Three -- Twelve Questions for the Interventionist: what are the key questions that the interventionist should ask the church staff of the church they are serving as a consultantChapter Nine -- What are the Central Organizing Principles of the Church -- each church is built on an identity and focuses on certain aspects in order to keep its members coming to the church. What is it? Is it the word-sacrament-liturgy, is it the pastor, a common missions focus, meaningful worship experiences, supportive relationships & networks, evangelism, world missions, Christian contemporary music/drama, healing ministries, etc? (Schaller lists 43 central organizing principles)Chapter Eleven -- 393 Diagnostic Questions was helpful in providing some key questions the interventionist should ask the pastoral staff, the youth staff, the governing board, the worship and music department, ex-members, etc. I felt chapter 11 was helpful. However, Lyle Schaller provides 393 questions to ask a church -- I'm not really sure if in an actual interventionist situation one would ask all of those 393 questions.B. My Constructive Feedback toward this Booka) This book would be more helpful if the author were to describe more simply what the role of the interventionist is, provide a simpler model or strategy for helping a dysfunctional church to turn itself around, give a picture of what a healthy, growing church looks like, describe workable models for helping the church to build unity, make good decisions, pursue the right goals, and build up a unified, effective leadership team.Instead, in each of the 12 chapters in this book, Schaller provides over 20 guidelines and questions for the interventionist to consider and to analyze. It is quite overwhelming.b) This book is too narrowly focused on the European - American model of church. Being from an Asian-American church, I felt that Lyle Schaller's description of the model for the church in chapter 7 (European or American) was too limited and too focused on two ethnic groups; it didn't seem to apply to my church. This book may not apply to other ethnic groups (e.g. Hispanic, Asian, Middle-Eastern, etc). The church in North America is no longer confined to the European-American model. I hope that Schaller will be more comprehensive and more inclusive of other ethnic groups which make up the church in America. The demographics of the church in North America is changing so rapidly -- the church in North America will increasingly incorporate more Hispanic, Asian, Afro-American, and Middle-Eastern constituency.I hope that Lyle E. Schaller can simplify this book and expand the model to include churches from other ethnic minorities. It will be much more helpful for people like me who do not belong to the European-American model of church.Let me give an example of what type of book was more helpful for me. The recent book The Missional Leader: Equipping Your Church to Reach a Changing World, by Alan J. Roxburgh and Fred Romanuk was much more helpful.Part One The Context and Challenge of Missional LeadershipThe authors provide 6 critical issues for missional leadership, talk about how to effectively go through transition in leadership; it provides the big picture for what a missional congregation looks like, and then provides a missional model.Part Two The Missional leaderThe authors describe the missional readiness factors and the nature of leadership, the character of a missional leader, how to cultivate the people of God for a missional future, and how to form a good environment to turn around the culture of the church; they also talk about how to get the congregation to be missions-minded, and lastly, they describe the steps to building a good leadership team.I liked the Missional Leader book more than Schaller's book because it provided a model, a good picture and description of what a God-centered missional church, congregation, and leadership looks like, and provides sound guidelines for moving from A to B. This is much more accessible and easier to comprehend, then to go through 50 questions and 50 subpoints for each chapter."},{"Title":"The Interventionist","review":"The Interventionist (1997) by Lyle E. SchallerIn The Interventionist, Lyle Schaller has written masterpiece for those aspiring church consultants, ministry leaders, and pastors alike. Focused on helping change agents bring health to a congregation, Schaller advocates the consulting by questions approach and is diligent at \\"peeling back the onion\\" of church stagnation issues. Of the twelve chapters in the book, eight of the titles are direct questions to the reader. Though not one of the question titles, chapter three is labeled \\"The Twelve Questions for the Interventionist\\" and includes inquiries about a consultant's role, defining the church's reality, and clarifying symptoms and problems.Some of the more pertinent sections I found valuable as a new consultant, include chapter three, as I have mentioned, chapter four \\"What Do You Bring?\\" and chapter eight, \\"Seventeen Syndromes\\". Like Schaller I am a church consultant, but these chapters among the others in the book will be valued for the \\"church champion\\" interim pastor and itinerant parish worker alike. It is good to be clear with the church on structures of accountability and expected follow through with action plans. An appropriate diagnosis and recommendation can only be made once the right questions have been asked and internal research completed. This is where the intersection of \\"What Your Bring\\" encompasses personal experience, an understanding of the surrounding community and interventionist methodology with questions to determine the real issues instead of congregational complaints. If you are consulting a church then there must be a reason why you are there.Also, having just returned from St. Thomas, an Anglican/Baptist church in Sheffield, England, Schaller's discussion in chapter seven, \\"European or American?\\" was very beneficial. In this chapter, Schaller describes the common differences in theology and methodology of North American churches that are English influenced versus those that are \\"American made\\". Of course there are always exceptions to generalizations and Schaller is quick to admit that. One of the denominations that seem to have transcended both the English and American traditions is the Southern Baptist Convention. Despite having its roots in the New England migration of Baptists from the British Isles, and though considered an exception to the European or American debate by many religious researchers, Schaller discloses his consideration of the Southern Baptist Convention of today as \\"largely an American creation\\" (p.95). Having been raised in a Southern Baptist church, I have been able to witness the many transformations the church has undergone to continually reach the city and those in its context.Schaller's work is still relevant to helping churches as it was when first published. As an authoritative researcher and church consulting practitioner, there is much wisdom to be gleaned from his experiences and labors in The Interventionist. This is a book that I have already returned to many times, and I am sure I will continue to refer back to it as I venture further along my ministry call."},{"Title":"'Injuns!': Native Americans in the Movies (Reaktion Books - Locations)","review":"No in depth analysis of why the 'injun' image persists throughout American and European history.

Imagine then my shock and delighted astonishment to find \\"Wanderer In The Perfect City\\" to be an almost complete re-issue of his \\"Shapinsky's Karma, Boggs' Bills,\\" a beautifully made volume (printed by the North Point Press, seemingly defunct now, alas) of beautifully written \\"passion pieces,\\" so-called in that they're focussed on artists singularly focussed (alternates: obsessed; crazed) upon a visionary (alt. quirky; really quirky) purpose that consumes and sustains their lives, their artistic being. A better review than this one would now list some examples of what I've just written, but unfortunately for you I'm only writing this review; and to be honest, a list of \\"those kooky artists and their kooky dreams!\\" would be a disservice to the sympathetic care Weschler employs in these portraits.Reading the original edition of \\"Shapinsky's Karma, Bogg's Bills\\" was one of my watershed discoveries made at the time of life when everything is a discovery. \\"Shapinsky's Karma...\\" was an eye-opener for me, an inspiration; it was also the second hardcover book I'd ever bought, a weighty commitment for a boy like me, but a most fortuitous one. (The first hardcover I ever bought was \\"Heretics of Dune.\\" _That_ wasn't nearly as inspirational.)Coming across \\"Shapinsky's Karma...\\" again in this new form and fourteen years later, is therefore an occasion of some contemplation and a little rue: to remember the impressionable kid I first reading that beautifully blue tome; and to see it again in this perfectly fine edition, a little faded, a little dated. Some of its subjects who languished in relative obscurity back in 1988 have become well-known, like Boggs and Spiegelman; a great many others seem to have simply faded away. Perhaps this is an indirect demonstration of passion and its curatives, its flutterings and gutterings.This new edition differs from the original in that the 1988 piece on Mark Boggs has been pulled; Weschler has expanded it into book-length. It's been supplanted with a piece on, I think, Ben Katchor, or whoever the \\"Mr. Knipl\\" cartoonist is."},{"Title":"A Wanderer in the Perfect City: Selected Passion Pieces","review":"The one thing that strikes me most about Weschler's writing is that he allows his subjects to talk. His quotes are long. One good thing about this is that the reader really gets to know the subjects well. It's almost like a Q&A; format. Thus, there is very little room for subjective opinions in Weschler's writing; he tells it like it is.This style leads, ultimately, to long articles -- one is almost 70 pages, the length of a short novella -- each naunce of the topic is covered from multiple perspectives, giving the reader a complete picture.My favorite article in the book is about a former rocket scientist turned Wall Street broker turned circus clown. Weschler chronicles the decision of one MIT grad to live his life-long dream of attending clown school. Along the way, Weschler convolves Aerospace engineering, bond trading, and circus performing, and allows the reader to see why each activity is just as difficult as the next.Recommended for all aspiring non-fiction writers.

Spinoza is a strange and interesting philosopher. His life sticks out in the history of philosophy. He not only philosophized, but he lived his philosophy. Q.E.D.II. After an assassination attempt, Spinoza managed to get excommunicated from the Amsterdam synagogue in 1656. Q.E.D.III. Spinoza turned down prestigious university posts and instead made his living grinding glass lenses. At the same time he composed a classic metaphysical system that he also applied to a political system. Q.E.D.IV. Spinoza was one of the first philosophers to claim that the aim of the state is individual freedom. Q.E.D.V. Though Spinoza's metaphysics belong to a different time, it is an example of how a theory of existence can be applied to a manner of living and being. Q.E.D.VI. This book provides a good but very short introduction to the life and philosophy of one of the most interesting philosophers in the history books. Q.E.D.VII. Spinoza managed to live a very humble life and still attain fame and recognition in his own time. He corresponded with Huygens, Newton, Leibniz, and other eminent people of the 17th century. Q.E.D.VIII. Spinoza's works were so controversial they were either not published during his lifetime or published anonymously shortly after his death. Q.E.D.IX. Spinoza's metaphysical system was based on pantheism, which posited that everything and everyone is God, so that if you hurt another you hurt yourself. There are corollaries to the modern Gaia hypothesis in this. Q.E.D.X. This book will leave you wanting to know more about Spinoza and why he wrote in a strange numbered aphoristic manner.

Strathern tells the story of Spinoza's lonely struggle to be true to his vision of God and Nature. Strathern writes of the famous excommunication from the Portugese Jewish community, the humble life of the lens-grinder, the loyal friend ready to take on mobs to protest against the assassination of the politician DeWitt, the supreme rationalist seeing all ' with the eyes of Eternity.' Spinoza who maintained his meditation was the meditation of a free man and so' a meditation on life and not on death' had a pure vision of God as Nature as All-in- All. His appeal to Goethe and English Romanticism came in part from this. His God is All, and yet sublime and impersonal if not like Joyce's paring his fingernails, then certainly not like the Old Testament Hebrew God intervening to prevent Abraham from taking the life of his only beloved son. In other words the God of Spinoza is a God very much of the philosophers, and not one which Pascal a figure of comparable intellectual intensity and aesthetic greatness would have abided.Strathern shows a clear admiration for his subject, and a respect for the subject- matter of his thought.

I thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 17 month old son who gets to listen to them to as his bedtime stories. One night he kept me up until 2am until I turned the tape back on! Normally he just gets to listen from 8 - 10pm. I would like to encourage Audio Scholar to produce more of these types of edutainment audio programs on tape or CD. In many instances I wouldn't mind seeing the programs extend to 4 tapes or CD's. I love listening to scientific books on my way to work and also love to share them with my 17 month old son as his bedtime stories. My budget for this type of audio edutainment is $1,000 a year and the more science and physics books abridged the better. I would love to see the following subjects abrigded to audio for distribution through Amazon.com. Maths, sciences, physics, astrophysics, geology, any and all space related topics, gravity, unified field theory, electromagnetics, electronics, microproccessor design, optics, micro-optics, electro-optics, light and the theory there of, satellites, satellite orbital mechanics and related theory.

Without his quick action, commercial developers, already coveting this national treasure, would have invaded the canyon's floor. Not until eleven years later did Congress make it a national park, an act that provided funds for development and preservation unavailable to national monuments.According to Hal Rothman, the designation of national monument--decided at the discretion of the president--was the saving grace for many natural and archaeologically significant sites as debates on national park designations languished in Congress. But lacking sufficient financial backing, national monuments inevitably ended up taking a back seat to the national park system in the early twentieth century.Looking at the history of the national monuments, from the passage of the Antiquities Act of 1906--allowing for presidential designation of monuments--to the present, Rothman traces the evolution of federal preservation. He shows how laws, policies, personalities, personal and bureaucratic rivalries, and a changing cultural climate affected preservation efforts. And he illustrates how the national park system has functioned and changed over the years as public officials have tried to implement federal policy at the grassroots level.The Antiquities Act, he contends, has been undervalued and ignored by contemporary observers and historians. In fact, he demonstrates, it is the most important piece of preservation legislation ever enacted by the U.S. government. Without it, many significant sites would have been destroyed as a result of congressional inertia and indifference.Rothman examines the evolution of this vital legislation, originally designed to preserve archaeological sites in the Southwest but later also used to maintain other significant prehistoric, historic, and natural features. He explains how the act became less significant as New Deal financing became available for the park system in the 1930s; how expansion and reorganization of the National Park Service brought more money and status to national monuments; and how, by the 1960s, national monuments had been integrated into the modern management system for park areas. Set in the context of the regulatory century, this book offers important new insights about how the American past has been preserved and packaged for the public.This book is part of the Development of Western Resources series.From the Back Cover\\"It is high time that a historian analyzed the role of the Antiquities Act of 1906 as a tool for historic preservation. This story is replete with heroes and villains (or at least obstructionists). It is a judicious view of the debates over the fate of our public lands.\\"--Charles B. Hosmer, Jr., in Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography\\"Rothman makes a persuasive case for giving the monuments their earned place in the history of preservation. He has a particular talent for choosing revealing case studies.\\"--Patricia Nelson Limerick in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History\\"No one interested in the national park system, the national monuments, or the history of archaeology can afford to ignore this book--or will want to.\\"--Stephen J. Pyne in Pacific Northwest Quarterly\\"Rothman has full comprehension of the environmental movement and deftly weaves the history of the national monuments into the unfolding of the bigger story. A major work for all interested in the environmental and historic preservation movements.\\"--Melody Webb in the Journal of Arizona History"},{"Title":"The English Presbyterians: From Elizabethan Puritanism to Modern Unitarianism","review":"As the title says, this book is a study of the development of Presbyterianism from the Cromwell era to roughly World War II. This was a story of a rapid decline (in my view) from the confessional establishment of Presbyterianism with the Westminster Assembly to Unitarianism to oblivion. The book does not reach the reestablishing of English Presbyterianism in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of England and Wales in the last decade.According to these authors, the loss of confessional orthodoxy began with Richard Baxter, who held that orthodox Calvinism was inherently antinomian. He therefore opposed the application of strict doctrinal examinations to candidates for the Presbyterian ministry. He suggested that the standard should be belief in the Bible alone. In fact, this was what led to the rapid rise of Unitarianism in the early 18th Century. The first Unitarians claimed that they believed in the Bible alone, a perversion of the Reformational sola scriptura, rather than any supposed traditions of men, such as the Trinity. They held that the application of standards of orthodoxy was equivalent to a new Inquisition.Those who held to orthodoxy tended to drift over to the Independents, so that a schism developed between the two traditional branches of Calvinist dissent. The authors appear to support the anti-confessional criticism of the orthodox Independents and Presbyterians on page 216, where they say, \\"newly-revived evangelical zeal produced a theological exclusiveness which led them to betray the catholic ideals of Baxter and Doddridge to which the Presbyterians alone remained loyal.\\"An application of British (mainly Scottish) ecclesiastical developments to later American events can be found inThe Erosion of Calvinist Orthodoxy: Drifting from the truth in confessional Scottish churches. This book is much more recent and is written from the perspective of an orthodox Presbyterian.One last comment: this book is very dry. I say this even as one who enjoys ecclesiatical history which most others would find dry."},{"Title":"Competitive Dominoes: How To Play Like A Champion","review":"At last!

Where is the missing Lady Rathbone? The love story between the haunted Lord Rathbone Janet is also endearing."},{"Title":"Lost Ladies of the Windswept Moor","review":"Published in 1990 LOST LADIES OF WINDSWEPT MOOR is a story written similar to JANE EYRE. A gloomy house, mysterious secrets, and a brooding man haunted with a dark past is married to a madwoman. Enter Janet (Jane) who is to refurbish some paintings that Lord Rathbone (Rochester) owns. Janet, nineteen, is mesmerized by John, Lord Rathbone, and Cheviot Chase (Thornfield Hall). The lord is a much older man who has been married twice; his first wife passed away under mysterious circumstances and his second current wife is insane. He is often moody but I still felt compassion for him.It has been awhile since I've read a gothic but LLOWM was pretty good. Written in the first person the story is closer to 3 1/2 stars. I had a bit of a problem with the infusion of some modern ways. Some characters call each other by first names and the relationship between Janet and Sarah (the housekeeper): one minute Sarah is a friend, the next she is a subordinate. Lastly, there were some moments when Janet had some doubts about John; those times were peppered toward the last third of the book when she LOVED him intensely.If you have ever read a gothic romance before you know the anguish and consuming, burning sensations between those who love each other. Still, it was a good mystery/romance. Janet and John are slowly drawn together despite their different social stations. A possible secondary romance, bickering among other guests at Cheviot Chase, and the shallow upper class and deception. What more could you ask for in a gothic?\\"You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.\\" ~~ F.

Steve Geppi of Diamond Distribution provides the introduction to this volume and relates his own life-long love of Archie Comics. One thing immediately noticeable about this volume is the cleavage on the girls, which was once completely banned back in the earlier days. As with the last couple of volumes the editors selected those stories which documented the many trends and fads from the decade of the 80's.In \\"In the Swing\\" from 1981, Veronica dons the preppie look in a nostalgic look back to the fashions of the 40's.\\"Bo Woe\\" has Vernoica undergoing treatments to give her hair the \\"Bo Derek\\" look from the film \\"10\\" with braids and beads. Problem is her new hair won't allow her to go out a boat date with a young playboy since she can't get her hair wet.\\"The Punk\\" from 1983 visits the punk music scene as Jughead cuts his hair into a Mohawk and begins calling himself Captain Thrash. Archie does his best to try and save his friend from the punk scene but Jughead has an ulterior motive behind this radical change.In \\"Break Dancing Break\\" from 1984, The Archies are told that the only way that they can get some new gigs is to cut a video. They have a hard time trying to come up with something catchy in their video until they enlist the aid of a group of street breakdancers to help them out.\\"Trivia Travesty\\" finds the gang playing the hottest new board game, Trivial Pursuit but things turn bad for Archie when his answers lead him to getting caught for two-timing Veronica with Betty.\\"Wheel of loot\\" is a spoof on the popular TV gameshow Wheel of Fortune as Betty stands-in for Vanna White as the games letter turner.In addition to these stories the book features stories on other great and no so great trends of the 1980's including the Urban Cowboy craze, ET the Extraterrestrial, Roller Disco, and Flash Dancing. Even a Michael Jackson-like pop star shows up in the book. As with the other books in this series we also get a couple of cover galleries with sample covers of the 1980's. I've had a chance to review all seven volumes in the Archie Americana series and the set stands as a great testament to the popularity of the Archie character, still going strong after more than 60 years. Throughout all the volumes the editors did a splendid job of choosing stories that were topical and representative of the various time periods. Highly recommended for any Archie fan!Reviewed By Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 5: Best Of The Eighties Book 1","review":"Ok, I love the whole series and loved reading this one as well.

The terminology may have changed since the compilation of these &quot;pathologies&quot;, which range from lustmurder, &quot;contrary sexual instinct&quot;, (homosexuality) frottage, masochism, sadism, sadomasochism, ideal sadism and pederasty. Though presented in a spare, descriptive, purportedly detached tone, it cannot be denied that Krafft-Ebing's purpose is not to offer an objective analysis, but to assume also the role of a guardian of moral order: a prognostician and theraputician of the deviances and illnesses that menace society. This role can only be fully understood in the context of his time, which unambiguously asserted the type of patriarchal masculinity and the sanctity of the monogamous bourgeois family. Under this standard, any &quot;deviance&quot; from these norms was not to be simply addressed by curative means, but also punitive ones. It would be interesting to put into contraposition the rhetorics and paradigms of Krafft-Ebing and Foucault, who, in more recent years, provided masterful and penetrating insights into the epistemic and discursive formations that have been used in modern society to regulate and police sexual behaviour, as in the nineteenth century's obligation to pathologise homosexuality as an &quot;aberration&quot;, a category rejected in the mainstream of the West. Though it must be of great interest to students of forensic medicine and clinical psychiatry, this study would also be equally appreciated by non-specialist readers who are interested in the subject of sexual deviance."},{"Title":"Ransom of Red Chief","review":"I had to read this last year for my English class, and thought that it was going to be just another lame story like all the other &quot;classics&quot; the public schools make us read.

Instead of a well behaved rich kid they get a wild, red-haired hellion, that insists on playing Indians, and sacres one of his kidnappers so much that they finnally take him back to his father, thinking that they'll just get rid of him then and there. Well, instead of a reward the kid's father says that if they pay him a hundred or so dollars he'll keep his son back for a while and he won't tell the neighbors that they brought him back until nightfall.

Some of his insights about physical phenomena millenia before the invention of real scientific instruments are astonishing.The other is that he is unrelentingly honest and rigorous. His premise is that we only know what we can find out from our senses and our reason. This is immensely liberating from all the causistry, tradition, authority, and sentiment of both culture and counter-culture.To the ultimate rationalization for religion, &quot;Well, it is a comfort for the simple.&quot; he responds, &quot;Truth and honesty are better than comfort.&quot; He dismissed death as nothing, and proved his point by showing legendary courage in facing his own."},{"Title":"Adventures in Odyssey Passages Spring Sampler","review":"If you enjoy the adventures in odyssey series you will really enjoy these passages stories.

The original hardcover Crowood Press, (Crowood Aviation Series) was published in Britain in 1998. It was printed on slick, heavy, coated paper stock with a good lines per inch resolution for very good photo reproduction. The paperback 2005 edition looks like they shot the plates off of the printed book rather than the original films. (Pre-digital I assume.) The photos are blotchy, blocked up and difficult to see any details. (Similar to poor copier copies.) The paper it is printed on is of much poorer quality. Some of the photos were even printed upside down, though they were correct in the original hardcover. Frankly, skip this one and look for the original, maroon-colored cover showing a painting of a British Liberator MkI attacking a sub and a photo looking down on a US B-24D. It is far superior in quality and worth hunting for. Mr. Bowman's writing is topnotch.

Instead of dying from getting tortured, he is rescued (and healed) by aliens and taken to Volarn, where Eric is reunited with his sister Olga. Now what? Return to Earth?Princess Kasha can't stand the fact that women are brought to their world to try and boost their flagging population growth, but more so because she know she will never be able to have her own mate. When the earthman catches her fancy, she see's him as a way too have a romantic distraction. Only Eric won't settle for anything less than marriage when all she wants is an affair.Myra Nour takes us back to the planet of Volarn where even a crown princess can be in the military. HEART OF THE DRAGON, to me, moves quickly, however, there are long passages with very little dialogue. While this lets the reader see more of the sights, I did find myself wishing that the characters would tell me what they were seeing. But don't plan on skipping paragraphs because a lot really does happen.I really like Kasha as a heroine. She is in the Getra (military) where it is her skills and abilities as a warrior that she is admired for not awarded to her because of her status. At the same time she is still a woman and even though a little stuck up (she is a princess), she is able to realize she wants more than the lonely existence she has allowed herself (she has an interesting secret!). It was fun to watch her grow emotionally and in the end fight for the chance to love Eric.There is a dragon in this story that Kasha and Eric find while out trying to track down an animal that is killing small children. Eric finds the dragon as a baby and names him Puff (after Puff the magic dragon...) however rather than being magical, Puff slobbers quite a bit, takes control of the story (for a little while) and had me laughing my head off. HEART OF THE DRAGON, while actually referring to Eric, is worth reading, if for any other reason, Puff.The people of Volarn have a Tarthra joining (which is initiated by the men) and will insure a love match. Because Eric is from Earth he cannot initiate the Tarthra, so in Kashas' eyes how could they suit? The romance between Kasha and Eric is sweet as Eric really tries to teach her that how two people feel about each other is very important, that there is more to a relationship than a physical joining. I got more than a few chuckles as Kasha tried to sway Eric into having casual sex, and Eric grouped with Jarvic, her cousin, quite frequently to avoid her. It was a roll reversal of a sort which I thoroughly enjoy in stories!Fast paced and witty, HEART OF THE DRAGON is a wonderful story that I really enjoyed. While you can read the story alone, it takes place after LOVE'S CAPTIVE and Serena and Rhamus are in this story; so if you are like me you'll want to read them in order so you won't spoil the first story by seeing the happily ever after.And what is going on with Jarvic? So I'm anticipating the third book in this series!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Petite Romantique)","review":"Now, usually when I see \\"green beret\\" and \\"alien princess\\" in the same plot description, I tend to drop the book like a hot potato. In this case, however, I also saw \\"dragon\\" and decided to take a chance. I should've trusted my original instincts. I don't like him, and I strongly dislike her. The story line was vaguely interesting, but doesn't really grab your attention and kinda jumps from place to place. We've met, but the readers will get bored with that eventually so let's take a ride out into the wilderness, well this can't be fun to read about, let's find a dragon! Overall it was rather boring and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, got close, but then it began to seem more like torture than a simple reading, so I gave up. I don't recommend this, but I will say that there are some who would enjoy it. It wasn't my cup of tea, but others might find it more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Pentax Classic Cameras: K Series M Series Lx Series Spotmatic Series","review":"The book includes a brief history of the company that made the classic, and some say, best cameras to come out of the 1960's. A sincere attempt to provide detailed coverage of the Spotmatic, K, M and finally, LX series of cameras is moderately successful for those who are familiar with these cameras. A good portion of the book is given over to general photography concepts and techniques. This provides a good refresher course and a handy reference. In many instances, tie-ins are made with various Pentax models, and overall, Pentax owners will find this book very useful. Collectors with considerable experience, both in making pictures and with these cameras will, however, be disappointed by the broad strokes used to describe the details of individual models. Many details, important to serious collectors and those making purchasing decisions, are overlooked. For example, the Spotmatic II is described merely as a Spotmatic with a hot shoe. Significant differences exist and are ignored. If you need every book written about the early TTL SLR Pentax cameras, then this book is a \\"must-have\\". If you need a book that is useful from a general standpoint and discusses early Pentax cameras too, this book comes with a good recommendation. If however, you want a definitive work about one of the most influential camera manufacturers and their products, you will do well to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Pentax Classic Cameras: K Series M Series Lx Series Spotmatic Series","review":"This book has alot to offer. First of all if you don't have your owner's manual for your classic Pentax this one covers the operation of your camera in great detail (btw, you can download the manuals from Pentax's website for free). It also gives you detailed specifications about your camera, it's history and comparison between models, information about new batteries (since the original Mercury ones are not available anymore), and so on.The book has detailed pictures of each camera and uses the pictures well to illustrate the particular feature the book is discussing. The book also provides information on accessories which were made for these cameras. It is written in very easy-to-understand language (not overly technical) so it is comfortable to someone new to photography, and it even explains a bunch of photography terms in the back of the book. The great thing about this book is that it tells you how to use your camera and take pictures with it as if you were new to using SLR's. For very experienced photographers, this book may have less to offer, but the history and camera specs for so many cameras in one handy book may be especially useful nonetheless."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Pentax Classic Cameras: K Series M Series Lx Series Spotmatic Series","review":"Easy to read and most informative text.

As the sub-title explicitly states - this book is about THE cultural crisis of our time and yet it was written 50 years ago. What Weaver does very well is distill the multitudes and complexities of impressions about \\"what's wrong out there\\" into a cohesive, thoughtful, but by no means simplistic analysis. In essence he states that man has lost sight of culture as a field of endeavor, a forum for the pursuit of personal nobility, and has given up on himself in the process. He opposes the modern idea that culture is a byproduct of man's existence not the expression of his ideals.Weaver does not have a problem with science, as mistakenly stated in a previous comment. He has a problem with scientism. He understands man in terms of potential and mystery, both of which are necessary and both of which may be abused as well as improved. He understands that only through a conscious return to cultural aspiration can mankind hope to withstand the assault of barbarianism. In his closing chapter he sums it up concisely and eloquently.\\"...culture is a protection against fanaticism both of the political and the religious kinds.\\" These are words we need to hear in our immediate context. The book develops the background and analysis on which this conclusion is reached.It is well worth the effort needed to read and understand this book."},{"Title":"Visions of Order: The Cultural Crisis of Our Times","review":"This book marks the third in Weaver's series, following Ideas Have Consequences and The Ethics of Rhetoric. Some of his arguments here are similar, but he communicates them much more clearly in this volume. Visions of Order also contains some of his best writing. His essays The Cultural Role of Rhetoric and Gnostics of Education both eloquently expound an orginal insight that complements his work very well. Weaver writes about the problem of modern liberalism. He sites areas where liberal thought rejects the notions of culture and form, and he defends the order in conservative communities which he feels best provide a home for man."},{"Title":"The Zulu War (Men at Arms Series, 57)","review":"Angus McBride is one of the best Military Illustrators on the scene.

I do not believe that such a couple has enough time together to truly get to know each other and feel that the physical attraction(lust)is all they have going for them,and do not like to see such couples marry,as that is a poor basis for marriage and seldom lasts for long. Plus in this case Bret is another hero that I really could not fall for.He is waaay too arrogant,and gave nothing of himself to Allison so that she could be confident of his feelings,so instead she felt like a fool,for her feelings!I made the mistake of reading the synopsis for book 3 Valiant Hearts and see it is more of the same,so I am stopping right here!For those who love ANGST filled romances and war/adventure stories,this series would be a good read."},{"Title":"Lions of the Desert (Egypt Trilogy #2)","review":"This book has alot of great parts in it.

Having read all of the Esmay Suiza series, I've found each book to be unique and excellent in its own right, and this one is no exception. The well-thought-out strategy and fast-paced action of the earlier Esmay Suiza books are what initially drew me in. Upon concluding the last chapter, I suddenly realized that there hadn't been nearly as much action as I had hoped for. But oddly enough, I didn't feel the least bit disappointed. I had cracked open the cover looking for battle action and glory, and instead found romance, interpersonal conflict, and political manipulation. Upon digesting the book, I realized that I was quite satisfied, even if I had paid hardcover price. I picked up this book expecting to find resolution to some of the unresolved plotlines from previous books. I was not disappointed, and honestly, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my plot predictions often proved incorrect. Had I known this book was low on action scenes, I wouldn't have read it. But I'm GLAD I was ignorant, because I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I started reading a book the other day that was so awful I literally hurled it into the trash can without finishing it. &quot;Against the Odds&quot; will not be joining that book, and is currently serving as a bookend for a growing collection of Elizabeth Moon books on my shelf... It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Against the Odds (2000) is the seventh SF novel in the Familias Regnant series, followingChange of Command. In the previous volume, Esmay incurred a dispute with Barin's family. Then the mutiny was announced and all Navy personnel were called back to their ships. Esmay and Barin were married by a magistrate and both their families complained.In this novel, Esmay Suiza is a Lieutenant in the Regular Space Service and the wife of Barin Serrano. She and Barin are together onboard a civilian ship in transit to their ships.Barin Serrano is a Junior Lieutenant in the RSS and the husband of Esmay. He is also the grandson of Admiral Vida Serrano. He and Esmay are celebrating their marriage on the Cecily Marie.Heris Serrano is a Commander in the RSS and the grand-niece of Vida Serrano. Because of the emergency, she is assigned to command another ship, the Indefatigable.Gustaf Aidersson is a Professor and a weapons scientist. Gussie is also a member of the Society for the Preservation of Antique Lore.Margiu Paralt is an Ensign in the RSS and a native of Xavier. She is Gussie's bodyguard on Cooper Mountain.Goonar Terakian is the captain of the Terakian Fortune, a family owned freighter. His cousin Basil is the second in command of the ship.Arash Livaldhi is an Admiral Minor in the RSS. He was the commanding admiral in seventh sector since Vida Serrano was suspended pending the results of her rejuv tests. Upon her return, he takes command of the Vigilance, the former ship of Heris Serrano.In this story, Gussie and his colleagues are stranded on Stack Three. Thinks to Ensign Paralt, they have gotten word of the mutiny out to th world and beyond. Now they just need to lure down a mutineer shuttle to evacuate the facility.Goonar docks his ship at Falleta Station. After attending a musical -- and falling into lust with the female lead -- he is hurried back to the ship by Basil. Goonar follows his second's lead, but they are going to have a discussion real soon.On the way up to the station, Basil tells him that a Benignity diplomatic shuttle is within the system. As their shuttle takes off, an auto shuttle follows them into orbit. Later, Goonar allows station security to inspect the auto shuttle.Then the Benignity representative wants his forces to board the ship and conduct a more thorough inspection. Goonar refuses and takes his ship away from the station with the security team still aboard. Then he has the discussion with Basil.Esmay is trapped by an ID booth on Trinidad Station. Station security comes to take her to the commanding officer. He presents her with discharge papers upon the order of \\"Admiral Serrano\\". Esmay immediately thinks of Vida and is rather upset.Esmay contacts the Terakian Fortune and mentions the name of Hazel Takeris, whom the RSS had rescued from the New Texas terrorists. Goonar talks to her and allows her passage to Castle Rock. He refuses all repayment, insisting that her presence is an honor to the Terakian clan.This tale has the RSS mustering its ships to retake the Cooper Mountain system and defeat the mutineers. Heris takes the Indefatigable out to search the jump points near Cooper Mountain. When the mutineers start raiding merchant ship for naval supplies, Arash and the Vigilance lead convoys.Meanwhile, Esmay is back on Castle Rock fighting the discharge. Her friends -- and reputation -- help her thread through the maze of Navy bureaucracy. Then Vida Serrano sends a few brisk messages and the morass is cleared.This is the last volume in the Familias Regnant series. One would really like to have more, but theVatta's Warseries is very similar.

She outdoes herself here and presents us with a believeable, exciting, dangerous SF universe. I thoroughly recommend this and indeed any of her works."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Against the Odds is the final book in the Seranno Legacy series. It's a space drama involving several families over several years. You get a little bit of action, a little bit of romance, planetside shooting, space ships, and military strategy. The series features strong female lead roles. The cover art for the books is very silly. But don't let that turn you off.Here's the book order if you are intersted: Hunting Party, Sporting Chance, Winning Colors, Once a Hero, Rules of Engagement, Change of Command, and Against the Odds.I started reading in the middle of the series. But, after reading that book, I went to the library and started at the beginning. I wish E.Moon would write more books about the Heris Serrano character."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This book which is really the second half of Change of Command does an excellent job of bringing this series to a satisfactory conclusion. I enjoyed reading it and it is up to the authors usual high standard.Let us hope that Elizabeth can be pushed into writing a new group of stories in this universe!"},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Elizabeth Moon's strengths are characters and action. In Against the Odds, she brings both together and gives us a nice adventure. Certainly she has brought her characters a long way over the course of this series.Occasionally, I found the speechifying of several of the characters to slow the narative. Although fully in context, I think we could have done with a little less of this. Also, while it seems to be the style these days to jump around amongst widely spread characters, narative threads, and physical location, I think Moon detracts from, rather than increases, the story's momemtum by relying on this device so much.Moon is a compelling writer and AGAINST THE ODDS is certainly worth the reading. Given the chance, it should be read after CHANGE OF COMMAND although it can certainly stand on its own."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Don't think of this as a sequel - think of it as the second half of Change of Command. (Definitely read Change of Command first!) Here, Moon does a great job tying up loose ends. The kids have grown up and are ready to kick some gluteus maximus of their own! Plenty of action and adventure, with some thoughtful points on the effects of rejuvenation on society. Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Elizabeth Moon has create a wonderful universe, believe military characters, and compromised its appeal with &quot;Against The Odds.&quot; This addition to the series does not have the raw excitement or passion of Moon's previous works. The story fills out the intrigue, broadens the character development of Esmay Suiza, builds a base for a wonderful follow up book,but will disappoint fans of the series. This is no &quot;Once a Hero&quot; nor &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, so if you love the series and have to read it, wait until its in paperback. I wish I did."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"In this the final book of the Serrano/Suiza series we come back to much of the promise we saw in the first 4 book! But we are still left hanging at the end!! This author has a bad habit of writing endings that while assure us of our favorite charcter's current status leave us hanging for the long term. While this series did have promise and was entertaining, I can't help but feel it was an attempt by the author to compete with David Weber's Honor Herrington series. It is an attempt that failed on two fronts. One the author is no where near the same caliber as Weber when it comes to writing about battles, tactics and military personel and politics. Second the author tries to make stage much of her story on character drama and and skip on the tatics of war, at the same time creating a drama that in several of her stories brings the general flow of the story to a screaming halt! I'd say this book is worth the reading time and the price of the book if only to finish off the series. But on the other hand the book itself is pretty good. But as a whole i'm disappointed with the series as several of the books just seemed to shoot the guts right out of it...or shoot it off at the legs whichever you prefere."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"I always look for uninterrupted time to read Elizabeth Moon and this was no exception. The story moved quickly in comfortable yet umpredictable patterns. The ideas may not be entirely new but the characters made me feel 'at home'. The action was mature, adult adventure with satisfactory outcomes.I look forward to another of hers."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This is the latest book in the Heris Serrano series, though Heris is not the main character. The book stands on its own, but the previous volumes would help fill in the background of the story. The heroine is Esmay Suiza, a Fleet officer who is not Fleet by birth, coming from an agricultural planet with a rather stuffy governmental system. (There has been only one previous Fleet member from that planet in the history of the Fleet.) There is a mutiny in the Fleet to fight, as well as incursions from the Bloodhorde (a particularly nasty group of pirates) and the Benignancy, a religion-based culture which is based on True Belief. The action is non-stop, and fascinating, but the characters are the element in which Elizabeth Moon excels. There are no stereotypes here: all the characters are living, breathing humans. Some you will love, others you will like, still others you will hate, and others you will pity. Altogether this book is one it is hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Esmay Suiza knows that marrying Barin Serrano against the wishes of both their families will have consequences, but she doesn't anticipate being dismissed from the Fleet on the orders of a Serrano admiral. As Esmay makes her way to Castle Rock, in hopes that her friend Brun Meager-Thornbuckle (of the Familias Regnant) may help, she has no idea that Barin has come close to dying in battle. Traveling aboard a trade-ship that doesn't normally carry passengers keeps her insulated from much of what's happening in the rest of Familias space, as the Fleet is torn apart by mutiny and Brun's family finds itself under attack from within.This seventh volume brings the Heris Serrano/Esmay Suiza series to a rousing conclusion, as the characters we've come to love find their places in the universe and their meticulously drawn society meets its greatest crisis. I'm disappointed that the author leaves several plot threads unresolved (or at least not clearly so), but it's an excellent read just the same. Especially the last poignant, downright haunting chapter."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"I loved Once A Hero, thought Change of Command just okay, but this book was absolutely awful. Save your $$."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"_Against the Odds_ is the seventh and apparently final book in Elizabeth Moon's series about the Familias Regnant. The Familias Regnant is the term for a large area of colonized worlds in a future galaxy in which humans seem to be the only intelligent species. There are several other confederations of worlds. Familias space is ruled by a number of aristocratic families, fairly but not entirely benignly. The novels cover a period of perhaps a decade, or a bit less, in which radical changes occur in the Familias government, moves in the direction of greater democracy.On the whole, I found the series very good reading. There are weaknesses: Moon tends to paint her villains too blackly, for one thing; and her plots seem to be driven a bit much by coincidence. But the stories are very exciting, the action is well described, and the main characters are very engaging, we really care about them. Bad things happen, usually with real costs, as well. The first book (_Hunting Party_) is nice but a bit light. I felt that the series hit its stride with the second book (_Sporting Chance_), and maintained a high level through the following three books (_Winning Colors_, _Once a Hero_, _Rules of Engagement_). The sixth book, _Change of Command_, was a serious disappointment. By this time Moon had several significant plot threads from previous books that she wanted to track, all involving different characters. Plus she added an important new thread, a mutiny with the Fleet by disaffected officers of extreme villainy. _Change of Command_ is a very disjointed book, jumping from thread to thread, sometimes with essentially no sense of connection.This final book, _Against the Odds_, is something of a return to form. It's still not as good, in my opinion, as the four central books, but the thread gathering in _Change of Command_ has by _Against the Odds_ at least resulted in the major threads all being sufficiently well associated so that even though this book also jumps all over the place, the various plot threads are all pretty much linked. The basic action of this book is the attempt to suppress the mutiny that began in _Change of Command_. In addition, some political assassinations which happened in that book have left an unsettled political situation, which needs to be resolved. And finally, Esmay has been discharged from the Navy for basically silly reasons, and she wishes to get reinstated and join the fight against the mutineers. There are still some structural hiccups: the Free Trader plot sort of peters out halfway through the book, while the closing segment of the book is really a separate, late-introduced subplot, which at least serves to unite Esmay and Heris for the final action, but which otherwise seems a bit of an arbitrary addition. And there are quite a number of, I thought, unlikely coincidences. But all that said, the book is a solid and fun read, and it does a good job of closing off the main series threads, while not wrapping everything up too tidily.I certainly recommend the entire series for anyone who likes colourful space opera, with engaging characters and neat action."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This installment of the Familias Regnant series has redeemed my faith in Elizabeth Moon. The previous book (Change of Command) was spotty and was more of a &quot;set-up&quot; for the events that take place in this book. I must agree with one of the other reviewers, they should have been one book. We get to see more of the irrepressable Cecilia deMarktos, and Heris Serrano of course. This book is about youth growing up -- the younger characters (Brun, Barin, and Esmay) all come into their own, parallelling the maturing that occurs in the Familias Regnant as the issue of the &quot;diamond ceiling&quot; of rejuv is tackled. I was very surprised by some of the events that occured in this book, and found the ending to be rather touching.I was hesitant about this book because the previous one just wasn't up to standard; however, I figured that _Change of Command_ was setting the stage for the next installment, and took a chance. Am I glad I did!"},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This is another one of those books, which I expected to enjoy far more then I did. I am probably one of the few people reviewing this book who thought that Change of Command was a superior novel to this one. I did enjoy the novel but had several issues with it.My first major issue was probably the time lapse since Change of Command. One of the problems with reading a series as it is written is that you have lag time that fogs your memory of the detail of the previous novels. The only way to avoid this issue is to either reread the previous book(s) whenever a new one comes out or to wait to read the series until it is finished. I am pretty sure that I would have enjoyed this book more is I had read it one week after reading Change of Command rather then 3 months later. Elizabeth Moon weaves a universe that if nothing else is complex.The other major issue I had was with character believability. I had a hard time understanding or believing the motivations for the actions of many of the characters, especially secondary characters. These character issues led to problems I had with the plot. When the characters no longer behave in a believable manner then the plot ceases to make sense. Many of the actions seemed so pat and trite. I know the closing bar scene was supposed to be stirring but I found nothing short of silly.Overall I was not completely satisfied with the novel and can't say that I am sad to see this series come to an apparent end. An adequate novel I do not regret reading but I am sure I will not read again."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This is a good job in bringing coherency back into this series, something nearly everyone thought was wrong with _Change of Command_. Esmay Suiza has finally grown out of her victim-character (that's a relief), and we get to see more of Heris Seranno in action. Even Lady Cecelia gets to have a good whack at the bad guys again.Don't start the series with this book; go back to the beginning and read them all. You're in for a treat if you do. Along with Weber's Honor Harrington series, this is the best space-opera currently running."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"This book ties up all the loose ends from Change of Commands. Here you have Esmay Suiza fleshed out and acting as a leader/captain in her own right, and all of the &quot;Children&quot; growing up. Where Change of Command was disappointingly unfinished, Against the Odds completes it. These books really should have been one novel -- and if you haven't read Change of Command, this one will be very confusing. However, Elizabeth Moon's characterization compells the reader to continue, and the characters continue to win your heart."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Having just finished the last book of the series, I can't help but paraphrase that old TS Eliot quote \\"This is the way the series ends - not with a bang but a whimper\\". On the whole, I enjoyed the series very much. The Heris Serrano trilogy was well written and (despite a strange preoccupation with the minutia of breeding horses) contained many memorable sequences. Esmay Suiza was, to my mind, an even better heroine than Heris and her first two books are in my opinion the strongest in the series. But then it comes to the last two books, and it just seems to be a mad rush to get to the last page. Elizabeth Moon has lots of good plot ideas throughout the series - The Benignity, the Bloodhorde, the mutineers, the problems on Altiplano, Sirialis and Copperwalls, the Rejuvenant vs, Aegist problem, the NewTex Militia etc., but she seems to have tried to cram in as much as she possibly could, and the effect is to leave far too much up in the air. What happened to the fugitive confessor? Why DID Arash Livadhi do what he did? What happened on Sirialis? All these questions (and many more) go unanswered.In my opinion, Elizabeth had enough plot ideas to fill twelve books, not just seven. And if she didn't want to write so many, one can't help but feel she should have left half of her ideas out in the interest of streamlining the story.Having said all that, I enjoyed the series and will adding her, alongside David Weber and John Ringo, on my list of American authors who deserve more UK recognition."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"It is hard to say what makes a book better than another and how much of it is personal preference and/or author's style. In the universe of the Serranos and Suizas, I give this book a thumbs up.I liked this book the most because it flowed so well. It was fun to read, I cared about the characters and was there with them as the story hopped from sub-plot to sub-plot. In the previous book, Change of Command, I was most disappointed because the sub-plots seem to take me away from the story and not into it.I have to say, the ending did take me by a surprise a bit. As if the story had a lot of mini-endings throughout the book and simply chose to end after one of them. Also, then ending scene was actually very well written to evoke emotion, however I agree with a previous reviewer who questioned whether events appropriately led up to such a scene.And lastly, as the book itself mentioned in the beginning, most likely this book won't be nearly as enjoyable as it was to me if you haven't read some of the previous books.Read the previous books in the series, they are fun."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"I'm trying to be absolutely fair to this book and series. I have no rave to give it, but I won't smack it around harshly either. I like the fact that Esmay Suiza finally gets to act with proper confidence, and I loved the jailbreak more-or-less led by civilians. I liked the ship-board scenes.What Moon does right is her action. No one has to display superhuman abilities, even with extremely high tech there is no deus-ex-machina. The politics are half-way reasonable. But only half-way. For one thing, at no point in these books have I believed the society shown could be ruled as discussed. It's just not reasonable, because power doesn't move as shown. Compare, for instance, the Familias Regnant with David Weber's Manticore.I liked the bargain Brun (who is almost a reasonable character in this book) has to make for power. Achilles' choice, indeed. Moon's discussion of what might happen in a society with a rejuvenation ability was quite good.My problem with this book is the same I've had with a couple others: complete anti-climax as an ending. There is no satisfying denoument. It all ends in a bit of a muddle, with no resolution of the real problems, and (sorry), a terribly unearned tear-jerking scene at the end. Yeah, I have some absent friends, and it brought them to mind, and I snivelled. But it isn't real.The title made no sense, but titles are not my thing. At least Moon works on the grammar, so it doesn't drive me nuts, and her style is always clean.She needs to work on her endings, though."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Someone implied this book is the end of the Familias Regnant series. I'm not so sure about that, but the end is, indeed, very satisfying. It has a sense of conclusion that few other books in the series had.The pace is pretty good for about three fourths of the book, but it gets bogged down in the middle. Also, some of the threads in the story are a bit weak, meaningless. Looking back, I can see why they were there, but one does get a sense of &quot;and the point is?&quot; while reading it.New readers should stay away from this book until they have read the rest of the series, though. Or, at the very least, the Esmay Luiza books of the series."},{"Title":"Against the Odds (The Serrano Legacy)","review":"Like Change of Command, this is not exactly a stand-alone book, and I would not recommend it as your very first Elizabeth Moon read. But oh, it's a lovely finish to the Familias Regnant series (which began with Hunting Party).I'm not ashamed to admit I cried at the end. To absent friends, indeed."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"This book is designed to be graphically catchy and has a compelling title. It doesn't really add any substantive ideas to the experience of someone who has already gone through the writing and submission process. I don't need someone to discuss sexual etiquette at writers' conferences or what type of Christmas greeting to send to my peers and business contacts. It might be fine for some recent college graduate or someone without any real world experience but if you have done the classes, attended the conferences, had a limited amount of success with free lance material and have been rejected countless times you already know just about everything printed here.

Do you never bother to go to writing conferences? Do you never look at Publishers Weekly? Were you shocked when the editor you've been pursuing for months signed a book deal with someone who is the son or daughter of one of their colleagues? Did you haul your 500 page, coffee stained manuscript to another author's signing and expected them to read it? If you can answer \\"yes\\" to any or all of these questions then you're a crack pot and you are not going to make it.Publishing is a tough business and Ms. Niles does a fine job in showing that to aspiring writers. My only complaint is the design of the book. It's supposed to look like old yellowed newspapers which is ugly and hard to read. Other than that the book is great.

Many novice writers contact me and I seem to repeat the same things over and over again. Now I can just hand those aspiring scribes this book!Compact and clever, this is a quick read--but don't be fooled, it is also a comprehensive overview. Get it if you want to know the real story.

Unlike some folks out there (who inhabit what she calls \\"Happy-Happy-Nice-Land\\"), Niles is frank about the fact that the unpublished writer will not find a supportive environment out there.This book deals with the nitty-gritty: everything from unspoken industry dress codes to critique groups that harm rather than help. It clues you in to the fact that literary or storytelling merit is only one consideration in attracting an agent or publisher. There are sections on pitching, book doctors, conferences, and the fine arts of ass-kissing and self-hyping; and the last chapter comes right out and says what most books dare not even whsiper: \\"Many of us won't make it.\\"This little volume is full of pithy, witty wisdom.

She tells about when she was first a novice writer and attended a presentation given at the local library by a literary agent named Carolyn Swayze. Niles was certain that if she could \\"just find a way to talk to Ms. Swayze privately, tell her my story, I was positive she would want to see the book. I was so convinced of this that I brought all 487 single-spaced, red-inked, coffee-stained pages along with me\\" (p. 16). Instead of a private consult with the agent, by the end of the evening Niles realized \\"I lost my writing virginity and realized I was a \`crackpot writer'\\" (p. 17). As a result of what she learned from the literary agent, Niles researched the ins and outs of the publishing business. She realized that she could share loads of information with writers, and this book came to fruition.In a clear, often cutting and usually humorous manner, Niles explains why so many writers do not get published and what they can do to improve their odds. Most of the reasons writers don't get their books in print have to do with the major gaffes they commit. So, for instance, Niles tells us \\"Many Writers Fail Because They Are Trying to Sell in the Wrong Markets,\\" and she offers an amazingly simple solution: Get out of the house and 1) go to the local bookstore; 2) imagine a book like yours; 3) go find it; 4) look around at what section you are in. Quite simply she says, \\"That's your market\\" (p. 34).Whether providing a list of Pros and Cons about the different types and styles of publishers or describing what makes a good query letter, Niles is delightfully brief and funny, more to the point than most other \\"How-To\\" books. She writes about the fact that \\"Hiring A Pro Doesn't Guarantee Success\\" and that \\"Some Agents are Dishonest from the Get-Go.\\" She often provides resource information, for instance for organizations such as the Association of Author Representatives and the Writers Guild of America.I found myself laughing out loud at times as I read. It's an odd shaped little book, about 6-by-6 inches, but the graphics, sidebars, and quotations are great! I particularly enjoyed the first quote, from Frank Lloyd Wright: \\"I'm all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools. Let's start with typewriters\\" (p. 15).Having worked slush piles for two publishers, I can attest to the fact that the advice Niles gives is accurate and insightful. This is exactly the type of book that should be read by any new writer or by anybody having trouble getting work accepted. I know that I wasn't aware of a number of the \\"brutal truths\\" early in my career, and any writer will be helped by reading Niles' no-nonsense advice. \\"Truth 6: Writers Are Like Popcorn: Publishers Buy Them by the Bucket and Eat Them by the Handful\\" (p. 41). If you want to avoid being a temporary popcorn snack-or being passed over for some other treat-read this book. ~Lori L.

The pages contain \\"newsprint\\" type writing around the edges - making it difficult to focus on the content being presented.Second, I was quite dismayed to find the author of this book happily announcing that her first novel had been published by PublishAmerica. That's the sign of someone who really doesn't know enough about the industry to be writing a book about writing. Ms. Niles had the opportunity to go with a POD press or take up an agent on an offer of representation, but she didn't want to rewrite her book AGAIN. Well, rewriting is the name of the game, and obviously she's doing the newbies no favors by not making that point clear, by admitting she chose to go with self-publishing (and don't give me the whole \\"I, as a PublishAmerica author didn't pay a cent to get published\\" - do the research on PA, and you'll discover how that \\"publisher\\" is viewed by the writing world - writing organizations don't accept publication with them as credit toward being published) and not to do the hard work of revising and rewriting that is often so necessary to achieve success in the publishing world.Self-pubbing works for certain niche books - but not for novels. (Yes, yes, there are exceptions to this - but they are EXCEPTIONS, not the rule.)Finally, much of the information presented in this book (Rules for conference behavior, how to choose a writing class, critique groups, pitching tips...) is available, free of charge, via writing articles on the internet.So again, starving writers, save your money. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":". . . the truth hurts. A lot of people who want to become writers and screenwriters approach the business with great intentions but naive expectations. The publishing and film industries do offer genuine opportunities for new entrants but due to the heavy workloads of editors, agents, and producers, they are quite demanding in what writers must deliver to warrant serious consideration. This book presents many of the \\"brutal truths\\" about the business in an honest but not cynical way that many books about entering the business either gloss over or ignore altogether. Furthermore, learning these truths can help writers understand the high level of craftsmanship required to break into the industry as well as the machinations that underlie the process of getting published. Some of truths in this book are so brutal you are unlikely to see them discussed at length in other writing books. Examples include writing instructors who are woefully inadequate, that retaining an editing service won't necessarily enhance your chances of having a publishable product, and sleeping with an editor, agent, producer, or big-name author is unlikely to result in a deal. However, some of the truths are not so brutal. For example, being a genuinely nice person who is not out to manipulate every contact or constantly seeking favors can pay off in the long run. Ms. Niles was very helpful to me during two Willamette Writers conferences and when I learned that she had written this book, I couldn't wait to buy it and post a review on Amazon. The publishing world is not really a mean and nasty place but it helps to know the pitfalls in the landscape. Reading this lively book is a much more enjoyable way to learn how to overcome the obstacles than stumbling into them."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"While this book contains useful information, there is one glaring error writers need to be aware of. Ms. Niles says that once you've had a project rejected by an editor at one of the six major conglomerate publishing houses, \\"That rejection is on file with all the companies under the conglomerate's roof.\\" That is generally not so. The \\"companies under the conglomerate's roof,\\" known as imprints, each function separately and a submission to one imprint generally does not have an effect on how the others might react. Don't believe me? Ask an agent.The overall reasoning in the book comes across as sound. Unfortunately many writers do starve, not because of a lack of talent but due to the iron law of supply and demand. There is far, far too much of a supply of written material compared to the demand for it. Very few people are frequent book buyers. Some may buy a book occasionally. Unfortunately most Americans never darken the door of a bookstore or purchase books in any other way. The odds in the writing business are just plain tough and writers need to find creative ways to beat them."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"When I first saw this title, I knew I had to have it. Probably like many people who have purchased this book, I too am in the midst of writing the proverbial \\"great American novel.\\" I have been at it for as long as I can remember, but I have been serious about it for the past two years. At times I feel like I am just about to finish a first draft, but only a few moments later I wonder if I have accomplished anything at all. Thankfully I have been in writing workshops with great teachers and participants, and I live in Boston which is a great literary city.While the book is titled SOME WRITERS DESERVE TO STARVE, and sounds negative in tone, I read it with the feeling that while some may deserve to starve, it may be a choice more than anything else. Elaura Niles writes about publishing from the perspective of a writer, and discusses in depth the brutal, ruthless, and more often than not thankless world of publishing. Her work is intriguing. It keeps writers from getting disillusioned by presenting the reality of publishing today. Dispelling the myths is helpful, at least to me, for it gets me to be more serious about my writing. It did nothing to dispel my dream that my words will be immortal, but it helped me realize that every time I sit down at my computer, the words that flow may not all be the immortal words I hope to leave behind, and if I want to leave something behind, I better be prepared to work. The book is also frank enough to keep me serious, so that maybe, twenty years after I'm gone my niece and nephew will not be going through my personal belongings and find a manuscript box with my words and think \\"poor Uncle Time, he always wanted to be published but...\\" Instead, they'll proudly show others Uncle Tim's novel in published form.The book assumes that readers have either completed a manuscript and are revising it or preparing to market it, or are at least at work on something substantial. It gives suggestions about writing, revising, finding agents, determining if an agent is honest, writing conferences, critique groups, and the do's and don't of contacting editors, agents, and other involved in publishing. It is humorous at time, and sharp at other times, but always honest.As I've mentioned in many reviews of writing and publishing books I have reviewed, I am at work on a novel and have yet to have anything published. When I read about writing I try and mix insights from great writers, some theory, and practical advice about publishing. When I am published I may have a better idea of the value of this book, but from where I am now it seems solid to me."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"Elaura Niles, Some Writers Deserve to Starve: 31 Brutal Truths About the Publishing Industry (Writers' Digest, 2005)While the best thing about this little book is far and away its snappy (and all too true) title, that's not to say that what's between the covers here isn't good. Niles takes a different approach to the \\"how to get published\\" book than most writers, choosing to highlight the stumbling blocks, the barriers, and the other things that make the road to publication an obstacle course. She guides you through some of them, but the important thing here is that now writers know they're there, even if there's nothing they can do about them. (How many books on how to get published will tell you, without varnish, \\"Nepotism happens.\\"?)A valuable, often amusing little book, and worth your time if you've gotten to that point in your writing career where you're about to shop a manuscript. ***"},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"I seem to recall that the reviews of this book, which was published by Writers Digest, polarized readers into \\"love it\\" and \\"hate it\\" camps. That usually indicates hard truths that aspiring writers don't want to hear or believe. Yep, such is the case here. Niles also writes with humor that can bite. It's a short easy read, I agree with all she says, and I happen to like the \\"unusual packaging\\" you'll see mentioned if you read the reviews on Amazon.But, well, it's also the same advice I've been giving out on my website, free, for the past 6 years. Maybe you want to buy this, read it without cracking the binding or folding the pages, and then give it as a gift to another aspiring writer you know. Every time I think I'm reading something that we all know, I stumble onto many many aspiring authors who don't know it, so I guess that's why we need books like this one. It's accurate and it's clever. What more can we ask?"},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"This review of Elaura Niles book, \\"Some Writers Deserve to Starve,\\" is mixed. Much praise goes to the author, not so for the format. The book's layout left much to be desired. I found the layot far to busy with its distracting side bars and columns, and difficult to remember the 31 key points. Elaura Niles has written a real eye-opener for aspiring authors. Some reviews suggest the book presents the cold, hard facts, but I didn't find her commentary cold at all. It not only offers a realistic view of the publishing industry, but in a generous spirit, Elaura gives stunning examples of how to go about such things the e-mail query. The right and wrong style of queries is worth the price of the book. A well crafted query can take hours, even days, yet Elaura spells out the how to write one in an easy to follow format. Her advice on critique groups and etiquette foster growth within the critique group. Most of all I admire her straight forward, zippy style that blends reality and humor. Kudos to the author. This book will be around for a long time."},{"Title":"Some Writers Deserve to Starve","review":"This book is quite a bit smaller than I thought. It's of a size as the bathroom reading joke books, but there is actually a good deal of valuable information in this little book. Elaura Niles writes about 31 common misperceptions of the publishing industry and gives writers seeking publication advice about agents and publishing and how to present oneself and good tips. There is very little info regarding actually producing a good manuscript, but if you have one then this book can help prevent you from falling into some traps and missteps while seeking publication. It's a decent and short book that is worth checking out.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Man From U.N.C. L.E., The","review":"Another story for us fans who loved the show. I have found after re-watching the series as I am doing, the books are overall better at keeping things moving along. So much more detail, which the series understandably was short on at times. Another thing I like about the books is in general they are an easy read, I can usually get through a book in a single day."},{"Title":"Man From U.N.C. L.E., The","review":"Again another hardback book for the series and I enjoyed the characters, plot and action...good for all ages, but for those who remember the series, a welcome."},{"Title":"Man From U.N.C. L.E., The","review":"This is one of two Whitman \\"Authorized TV Adventure\\" books published for children in 1966. These books were more sophisticated compared to \\"The Calcutta Affair\\" which was a much smaller book and illustrated with comic-like color pictures. The two Whitman books were illustrated with brown & white drawings, and sold for 59 cents each when brand new. \\"The Gentle Saboteur\\" is Albert Stanley, a demolitions expert working for the British branch of T.H.R.U.S.H. (\\"Technical Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity\\"). Stanley's mission is to land at JFK Airport in New York City and plant small but powerful explosives at major public monuments like the Statue of Liberty. The explosives he carries are nuclear but produce no radiation - an oxymoron in the real world but just fine for the story! Stanley is apprehended by U.N.C.L.E. agents before he does anything deadly, but T.H.R.U.S.H. is able to kidnap both Ilya Kuryakin and the son of the British Ambassador to the United Nations to exchange them for Albert Stanley. The two hostages are taken to the extreme eastern end of the Hamptons on Long Island and held in isolation in a windowless cell on the grounds of a luxurious mansion. Napoleon Solo is given the task of driving Albert Stanley from Manhattan to the Hamptons in order to exchange them for Kuryakin and the boy. T.H.R.U.S.H. plans to murder Solo, Kuryakin and the boy, but Pamela Hunter (the young and beautiful Blonde T.H.R.U.S.H. agent who kidnapped both Kuryakin and the boy) has a change of heart and defects and frees both prisoners. In the meantime, Solo had swallowed a special U.N.C.L.E. formula back at HQ in Manhattan which would allow other U.N.C.L.E. agents to track his movements for 24 hours - another neat example of U.N.C.L.E. technology! The U.N.C.L.E. agents move in on the mansion, overpower the two T.H.R.U.S.H. agents posted there and it's left to a near-naked Napoleon Solo (T.H.R.U.S.H. had forced him to strip down to a pair of swimming trunks and sunglasses) to get Leslie Tudor, the head of the British section of T.H.R.U.S.H. Solo succeeds, and surprise, surprise for 1966 - Leslie Tudor turns out to be a woman! This is a great book and no less sophisticated than the adult U.N.C.L.E. novels of its time - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pounding Hooves","review":"Absolutely wonderful! A great story about a girl, Lori, who loves horses but her mother is against them, especially oweing to the fact that her last pony broke her dad's arm. Lori is in love with a neighbor boy from school, and this boy acquires a beautiful Palomino Arabian mare named Storm, who hates and fears humans, due to abuse. The whole story details Lori's struggle with falling in love with Storm, trying to raise money to buy her, and the rich girl at school who wants both Storm and the boy Lori loves. MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Pounding Hooves","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. It was and has always been my favorite horse story.

If you like horses, find this one."},{"Title":"Pounding Hooves","review":"When I first finished this book, I sat back and tried to digest the message that the book gave. It was deep and strong: love. Not the kind of love between a man and a woman, the love that occurs between friends. I thought that this book was very special, and I will always have a place for it on my shelf."},{"Title":"Pounding Hooves","review":"I read this as a kid and liked it. This is not my favorite horse novel though, by any means. I read lots and lots of 'girly' horse novels as a kid and I would rate this one as slightly above average. It's about a girl named Lori who tames a 'wild' Arabian mare named Storm. There is conflict when a rich girl wants to buy Storm and on top of it wants to steal the boy who Lori likes. I found the ending a little predictable. It was readable but didn't really capture my fancy and I found myself bored. The plot was not terrible but it lacked origiality and the characters seemed a little fake. I felt like I was reading a fiction story and it lacked that special 'magic' that makes a reader feel like they have entered the world of the character. I think this is a decent read for a horse-crazy girl. I enjoyed it but I don't think it's a book I will read again...One other note, there is a big hole in the story: Pure Arabian horses never come in the color 'palomino' it's not in their genetic makeup. They lack the 'dilution' gene which makes this possible. A light chestnut can look similar to a palomino and even sold as such to people who don't know better, but it's not the same gene. Just thought I would mention this because Storm was supposed to be a palomino Arabian. It really bothers me when writers don't do their research!"},{"Title":"Pounding Hooves","review":"Pounding Hooves is a wonderful story about a young girl who truly finds herself.

At the same time he is also trying to romance a lovely young lady, and of course he wants her to think he is great father material, even though in private he thinks the boys are little monsters.You've probably seen this plot in movies and sitcoms, perhaps this book was the original which inspired them."},{"Title":"Helen's babies","review":"I could not stop laughing while I read this book.

The premise is great, but the execution is absolutely hilarious. I have to wonder if the author perhaps had mischievous kids. He really nails this one, and I'm curious to know what (or who) inspired him to create this masterpiece featuring kids who have turned causing trouble into an avant-garde art form.This book is a load of fun. The characters are unforgettable and will remind you of people you know in real life. What's even more unforgettable is the elaborate and highly original mayhem that the kids cause, which they always manage to do at the worst possible time.What I loved the most about this book was its comedic brilliance. The author could have written a book about a couple of mischievous kids, and it would have been funny. Adding a hapless bachelor as their babysitter is even funnier. But having a hapless bachelor as the babysitter of mischievous kids he cannot control, and adding a love interest whom the bachelor is trying to convince that he is great father material, and having her keep showing up when he's in trouble way over his head with the kids, is comedic genius.I highly recommend this book. It's \\"falling out of your chair laughing\\" funny, and you can feel your troubles drift away as you read it."},{"Title":"Helen's babies","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. I've read it several times over the years and my fourteen year-old daughter has read it aloud, to me, twice. We laugh ourselves silly, re-read countless passages and use some of the phrases in everyday life when being nutty. It's such a worthwhile read and anyone with children can appreciate how spot-on Habberton's description of little boys (who are well-intended) can get into trouble (with hysterical results). A CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Helen's babies","review":"This book is a riot. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read. Harry, a childless man, agrees to take care of his two nephews, Toddie and Budge, only to find himself in way over his head. At the same time he's trying to convince a lady he's romancing that he would be a great father, but every time she sees him with the kids they're causing him more trouble than he can handle.This book became an instant sensation when it was published. Originally aimed at adult readers, it became a major juvenile literature success overnight, and it's still very popular with kids today. That's no surprise with it being so hilarious and with the kids always being the ones who come out on top.As for adult readers, I think we can all relate to Harry's predicament. There's been some time or another in our lives when a rambunctious child has gotten the best of us, though in Harry's case, it's happening non-stop and at the most inopportune times.I loved this book. The predicaments that poor Harry finds himself in are unbelievably funny, and Habberton paints such a vivid picture that you can easily envision the zaniness. Every time I pictured each particular mess that the kids had gotten Harry into in my mind, I could not keep from bursting out laughing."},{"Title":"Helen's babies","review":"Worth a look for an insider's view to the state of bachelor/nephew relations amongst the New York society set.

She was the first female Prime Minister of any Muslim nation, and the Pakistani equivalent in many ways of Indira Gandhi, including, unfortunately, the manner of her death.This book does not give much insight into the various controversies and scandals of Bhutto's life -- being written more as a school-book variety biography, it gives basic facts about Pakistan, about Bhutto's family and her own life, and gives a few bits and pieces of her own quo0tes and writing. Unfortunately, there aren't many books available on Bhutto (and somewhat ironically, there is an upcoming autobiography due to be released in April 2008).One would do just as well at the moment to scan the various internet sources for information about Bhutto, but for younger people who should remember this person, who in many ways was inspiring and hope-ful, it could be worthwhile."},{"Title":"Benazir Bhutto: From Prison to Prime Minister","review":"wanted daughter of east by Benzhir bhutto but it was a little expensive so i came on this..

An architecture that mainly revolved around the seriousness of the International Style, its theories peaked in 1958 with the New York City Seagram Building, a glass-covered, steel skeleton-framed skyscraper. Mies van der Rohe's \\"less is more\\" principle became the guiding light for a large majority of American architects in the mid-twentieth century.In response to the perceived dogma and humorlessness of the International Style, a Popular Modernism began to take hold in Southern Florida. An \\"Architecture of Joy\\" was born, which of course was decried as frivolous and crass by the architectural establishment. In Miami Beach, resort architecture was already well underway, and its vacation state of mind easily stepped into this style. It was uniquely American, futuristic, and fun, full of audacious angles and lines, pastel colors, synthetic materials, cheese-hole and accordion folded walls, stainless steel, boomerangs and stairways to nowhere.Popular Modernism is known by various names, including Populuxe (popular and deluxe) and Googie. In Miami and Miami Beach, it is called \\"MiMo,\\" an abbreviation of Miami Modern.This is a wonderful book that covers its subject well. Its not so large that it becomes uncomfortable to read while sitting in an easy chair but still large enough to deserve it's place on the living room table. The layout is exceptional and reflects the playfulness of the subject without becoming a confusing mishmash. The font is a bit uncommon but lends itself to the spirit of the endeavor. The text by Eric Nash and Randall Robinson is crisp and informative. Oh, and the photos are a great!Once in a while an architecture book comes along to show us how it's done and this book is one."},{"Title":"MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed","review":"Excellent survey of MiMo architecture, past and present.

Like all rich Cuban kids my grandfather brought the family to Miami Beach a few times a year for shopping and business and loved the architecture of Miami of this time. ( They were at the Carillon Hotel on Miami Beach when the Batista regime collapsed New Years Eve (1958 -59 ) There has been such hoopla to preserve Miami Beach's Art Deco building while many of the mid century modern masterpieces are being torn down or in the case of the Carillon Hotel mutilated beyond recognition. This book is a must of any lover of Miami and it's history."},{"Title":"MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed","review":"As an architecture student in Miami, I absolutely love this book. It's extremely useful to help understand some of the SoBe culture and architectural history. A great reference!"},{"Title":"MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed","review":"There's a school of thought, so to speak, about Miami that holds that no matter what it does it will be tacky in the end. Having grown up there, I sort of agree. This charming book, with smart illustrations, doesn't at all make one reconsider such a view, rather puts it in the mountains out of molehills category. Its pointless to think of the architectural spasms pictured therein as having artistic merit or not. I testify that I actually purchased this volume at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, where it was displayed showing the South Pacific Motel on page eighty-eight. Stopped dead in my tracks in by the sight of this book in the NGA bookstore in what is arguably not only Washington DC's greatest museum but perhaps the world's. Having grown up in the Morningside Neighborhood of Miami which is right off Biscayne Boulevard, I know a thing or two about not only the South Pacific Motel and but also the others. It's to this book's credit that it manages not to convey the character of these places, which from the priveleged world of Mornignside houses, so close yet so far away, always seemed nothing but completely sleazy. An Artforum online review of Art Basel referredquite naively and stupidly to the idea of Miami in scare quotes.This makes no sense to anyone who knows Miamibecause Miami has exquisitely beautiful houses, full of the best taste, which rely on the same stylistic tropesas those buildings of the worst taste many of which are featured and cleverly described in the text. Miami in scare quotes --\\"Miami\\" -- would seem to fit this book if anything at all. The too-clever will see in all this an easy point about the erasure of standards, the triumph of kitsch and so on. Miami will always have poles between the classy places like the Rubell Collection and CasaLin , and the pseudo-classy like the the new concert hall they put up on Biscayne, a place that deserves scare quotes if there ever was one, This book makes clear that some of the architectural elements were borrowed from Las Vegas. Doesn't that lend credenceto the idea that these distinctions are fatuous when applied to such places. Washington DC is known for its John Russell Pope buildings, Miami for its Morris Lapidus creations. Doesn't that say it all? Lapidus' famous stairway to nowhere at the Fountainbleu is perhaps the best representation of all this. You can make distinctions, ascend or descend on the stairway of taste, but this stairway does not get you any higher than you've been before."},{"Title":"MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed","review":"Less weighty than I had hoped, and because of its chatty style much more difficult to read than I had hoped (don't people employ editors any more?)

Fortunately they capitulated. This book is an exercise in gross self-indulgence and unprofessionalism. It's not only that it's illegible, but it's loaded with postage stamp sized pictures (literally) that are tinted red, blue, green, yellow....etc. It's as if a child pasted a disparate bunch of pictures in a notebook and made an attempt at writing prose.

There arent many projects either. The book seems like an excuse to show pretty furniture pictures.If you like country furniture, try &quot;Country Pine&quot; from Bill Hylton instead. Much more projects than this one and more construction hints and tips."},{"Title":"An experiment of time","review":"The author of this book admits that if anyone else had told him of their precognitive dreams he would have had no difficulty dismissing them as coincidence. However, the fact that he himself spontaneously experienced a number of striking examples of such phenomena changed everything. As well it should have, for if we can make contact with the future it means that the entire foundation of our shared conventional assumptions about reality and existence are simply wrong.The author, one of Britain's first aeronautical engineers, designed a series of experiments to attempt to repeat such contact with future events by way of dream. First he used himself as subject, and then he brought a larger number of ordinary friends and acquaintances in. He found that if careful attention was paid to documenting the details of one's dreams immediately after waking, and carefully reviewing and comparing those dream records with later events, then almost everyone has this ability to some extent. Most of us tend to ignore this fact out of some ingrained habit of thought. Later, it was found that this ability to contact the future isn't strictly limited to dream consciousness. It was found that while waking, people could open themselves up to seemingly random impressions that were later documented to agree with future events (such as concentrating on a book that one had never read before- and receiving definite \\"hits\\" on the contents and specific words and phrases- that go way beyond chance.) Further analysis of dream material also showed that we made \\"contact\\" with past events in our lives about as much as we did future ones. Once freed of our habitual way of assuming time as linear (and one way) and the world as strictly three dimensional, the mind seemed to be capable of intermittently ranging past and future in an unfocussed state. The conclusion was that both past and future exist in a higher dimensional framework- and since we can access them- then probably so do we.The first part of this book is primarily empirical, while the second is primarily logical (an elaborate model- complete with diagrams- explaining multidimensional mechanics.) The first part is much more readable. As for the second, as ingenious as it is, I cannot but help think that a cerebrum concentrated in third dimensional consciousness is inadequate to explain higher dimensional realities. We can experience the fact that there must be more to our ordinary conception of reality, but to truly understand it is another matter. Yet, the day will come for us all when we no longer intersect with this three dimensional world- and then we will be free to focus our concentration on the higher dimensional extent of our being.The only restriction in breaking free of our conventional time-consciousness is shaking our selves free of our ingrained habit of seeing the world. Once you have personally experienced such precognitive events, or perhaps synchronicity, then this is much easier- and their frequency increases. It isn't enough to wish or believe- you have to KNOW....This is the original first edition of this classic."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"Lukac, wow! Where did he come from! OBC is a must read! A world of suspense, horror and fantasy ... or is it? Edge of your seat page turner, once you start you won't be able to stop until you've read the last sentence. And when you finish, you'll turn to the beginning and read it again. A piece of literary art that will leave you breathless, looking over your shoulder and begging for more."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"Stephen Lukac's Oogie Boogie Central is a novel that cannot fully be taken seriously. It was written for the sole purpose of entertaining its audience, something it does quite well in fact. This over-the-top thrill-a-minute ride is so entertaining that it makes you keep on turning the pages.The book concerns the little voices you often hear in your head. In this case, they are real entities that are residing inside the head of their host. The hosts are called gatherers. Alex is one of them. But you also have hunters, people that can only hold one other resident inside their heads. The hunters are violent and hungry for mayhem.Add to this mix a security guard who's on the trail of the serial killer that has entered the mind of a hunter, and you get a bloodythrill ride that never has a dull moment.I really liked the characters and they way they acted and spoke. The dialogue is amazingly witty and real. This book has it all; suspense, horror, mystery... It seems that the whole of it could easily have come crashing down. The book is very busy at time, so busy in fact that you sometimes have trouble following what everyone is doing. But amazingly enough, every time the story blurs a little, Lukac brings everything back into focus.Oogie Boogie Central is like one of those great B-movies that you want to keep watching over and over again, but with a little more heart and style. I really enjoyed the ride it gave me, and probably won't soon forget it either."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"I read Steve Lukac's &quot;But Then Again, You'll Have This...&quot; before reading this book, so I was already familiar with his dry wit and pleasantly off-kilter way of looking at the world. In his first novel, &quot;Oogie Boogie Central&quot;, this talent is applied to the telling of a story that is in turns intriguing, amusing, unsettling, but at all times entertaining. Lukac transports us to a universe where Charleston, WV, has a subway system and people have a tendency to get into other people's heads...literally. His characters--especially store detective Milo, his wife Sharon, his friend Keith, the villain of the story (who goes through several metamorphoses over the course of the novel), and the gang of mental entities that leap from person to person as the story goes on--jump off the page and make you wonder if you haven't met them somewhere before. The interplay between these characters is what made this story so appealing to me...this interaction indicates that Lukac has spent a lot of time observing people from all backgrounds and noting how they react to one another and to various situations. The story, which defies categorization (Horror? Adventure? Mystery? Satire? A little of everything, really...) is like a roller-coaster: anticipation mixed with a little trepidation, followed by a wild ride with ups and down and more than one unexpected twist, and at the end those who have truly enjoyed the ride are yelling for more. Count me in that group!"},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"At various times OBC is a horror novel,a thriller, a fantasy piece and a disturbing ride through the territory of mental illness.

If you have enjoyed books by veterans such as Skipp & Spector and Brian Keene, or up and comers like Kelli Owen, then M. Stephen Lukac\`s storytelling will definitely satisfy.OOGIE BOOGIE CENTRAL is easily one of the more original horror novels I have read in a long time. Between the overall concept of the Hunters and Gatherers and the implications of other weird goings on in West Virginia, the novel feels like a great starting point for a larger body of interconnected works. Worldbuilding is something I really enjoy, and I hope we get to see more of Lukac's creation.As mentioned in an earlier review of OOGIE BOOGIE CENTRAL, there are tonal similarities between OOGIE BOOGIE CENTRAL and BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU'LL HAVE THIS. The humour and wit Lukac displays in his non-fiction is readily apparent in his fiction, with the real payoff being terrifically organic character dynamics and dialogue.The one non-genre writer that came to mind as a comparison, and in hindsight I should not be surprised, is Andrew Vachss. Philip Ducalion may be the the most obvious point of comparison, but the notion of what is horrific also struck me as being influenced by Vachss.Having said all this, you will be entertained, I assure you. As for myself, I can't wait to see what else Lukac has in store for us in Oogie Boogie Central"},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"It's hard to classify this book under just one genre. Horror, mystery, thriller? Yes. The only thing you should expect before reading this is to be entertained, because you'll have that and so much more. From the witty dialogue to the page-turning plot twists, Lukac keeps you coming back for more. His voice is strong and clear, and I believe we definitely need to see more work from him, ASAP."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"I picked this book at the recommendation of a friend, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It takes place in Charleston, WV (which completely thrills me, because I grew up in WV) and involves a strange mix of multiple personalities, serial killers, life after death, and shop lifters. Lukac's writing is clear, and the themes and ideas introduced in this novel are incredibly intriguing. I can't wait to pick up Oogie Boogie Bounce, which I've heard is even better than this book.My only complaint of the book as a whole is the character Philip Ducalion. He is a very important character - I won't say why because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it. I just felt as if he was developed enough. He wasn't introduced until later in the book, and then I wasn't sure why he was introduced. It was all very unclear to me, and still is even though I've finished the book."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"It's not often a horror novel can be called delightful, but this one sure is! With warped characters, hilarious scenes, and honest-=to-goodness scares - what else could you call it? Truly a one of a kind find! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"Don't let its warped title stop you from taking a hellacious ride through insanity and back! OOGIE BOOGIE CENTRAL is an awesome debut: a complex, gripping novel that turns Multiple Personality Disorder into a psychic battlefield. There is an undeniable 'splatterpunk' influence (in the style of Schow, Skipp and Spector)--a good deal of strong graphic violence, but it's no mere slash-fest. Milo Tucker and Ted Munsch are the most offbeat hero and villain seen in quite some time. A fascinating premise and unique characters make OOGIE BOOGIE CENTRAL well worth the read."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"This was an easy, entertaining read. Not that I want to take away from the author's work; I would describe J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter) and Jim Butcher (The Dresden Files) in the same manner. In fact, I would say that if you enjoy Butcher, Lukac should be right up your alley. I read this book a few years ago and still tell people about it. Can't wait to get the new sequel, \\"Oogie Boogie Bounce\\"."},{"Title":"Oogie Boogie Central","review":"Twisted, warped, funny as hell, and 100% original. There has NEVER been another book like this one, and you DO NOT want to miss out. It's worth the cover price for page 149 alone, where I laughed so hard I had an accident..."},{"Title":"Skorzeny's Secret Missions","review":"This is a gripping account of Commando warlord Otto Skorzeny's various WWII missions, the most famous being his rescue of Benito Mussolini. The exploits of SS Major Skorzeny, \\"the most dangerous man in Europe\\", earned him a reputation that survives to this day, and this account explains why. Because they labored under a severe material and military disadvantage, the Germans had to be more daring and resourceful than the Allies, and Skorzeny's military career testified to that. They actually had set a plan in motion to assassinate Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt at Tehran before a security leak forced it to be aborted. In addition to the very interesting details of his various meetings with Hitler, Skorzeny relates his part in the overthrow of the Hungarian government, the Mussolini rescue, the July 20 coup attempt and the false flag operation in the Battle of the Bulge, among others. It's too bad he couldn't have written about his escape from an Allied POW camp and his subsequent adventures in the underground, but the man did have a price on his head at the time of publication. One thing I haven't figured out is if he wasn't denazified until 1952, how did a wanted man get a book deal?"},{"Title":"The Best of Enya (Easy Piano Series)","review":"This Book is awesome. If you do not have the best piano skills but can play a little you will be able to play it. But, if you are an excellent piano player you will still enjoy it and be able to play it. My sister and I both got this book. She is more advanced than I am but we both enjoy playing out of it. If you are looking for some fun piano music to play this would be an excellent choice!"},{"Title":"The Best of Enya (Easy Piano Series)","review":"Enya piano music ain't generally easy, but this booklet gives a basic feel of the sound of the pieces without providing the complex and nearly impossible to play nuances that make Enya's music unique. I took up piano after quitting many years ago and this was a good way to ease back in. I recommend Enya's Shepard Moons and Watermark books as the next two steps to being able to play and appreciate her music. They are quite faithful to the recordings. I would stay away from the Amarantine and Winter Came books until the very absolute last. Enya isn't the queen of sharps and flats for nothing and beginners will hate that so many notes are altogether off the staff in upper and lower octaves and if you start with either of those books, you'll probably become very discouraged."},{"Title":"The Best of Enya (Easy Piano Series)","review":"I love Enya's music. So I thought I would like to play it on my keyboard. The problem is that on some of Amazon's books it says look inside this book. I do wish they would let you look at maybe one page to see if it is at the playing level that you are at. I know it says easy piano but there are people who produce different easy piano books for instance Dan Coats is easier than this book."},{"Title":"Marsha","review":"Marsha is one of my very favorite books. All of Margaret Maze Craig's books are excellent. This is a \\"Malt Shop\\" era book, but with somewhat more adult writing than you'll find with Anne Emery or Rosamond du Jardin (I think Margaret is the best of this crowd).Marsha is the story of a seventeen year old who has always been in her sister's shadow. When she meets the boy of her dreams, she has to fight both her family and her own self image to learn that she is her own person and deserves the love that's offered to her.If you like the sort of story told in Molly Ringwald movies like Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Marsha","review":"I have owned this book since I was a teenager. The story is interesting and very mature. It is especially good for young women who compare themselves to others. I am 63 years old and still occasionally pull this book out of my shelf and read it again, the story is that good!"},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"Is this a western with a romance in it, or a romance set in the west? I don't know, but it sure is a lot of fun! Even though I don't often read in either of those genres, I found it very entertaining, and look forward to reading more in the series.I read the free Kindle edition, ASIN B000JQV3Q0 with a publication date of November 1, 2005. No formatting issues that I noticed. The original edition apparently had illustrations, which are not included. However it's not clear whether illustrations are included in the Kindle versions you need to pay for, either. In fact, the description for at least one fairly expensive paper reprint edition states that illustrations are not included. Until a paid version with illustrations is available, I'm perfectly content with this freebie."},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"This is a terrific escape book, one that deserves a &quot;10&quot; rating for its entertainment value. The characters are appealing, the language is incredibly clean by today's standards, and there is much laugh-aloud humor. &quot;Chip of the Flying U&quot; is tremendous fun!"},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"This book is just a cute little book definately from a time gone by. Easier read than a Lamour, but still a pretty solid western, even by today's standards."},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"As a Montanan cowgirl myself, I found Chip of the Flying U truthful and entertaining. The characters are real and the story is innocent. B.M. Bower knew the characters she created and it shows."},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"I grew up with Chip of the Flying U and have throughly enjoyed re-reading it. I will enjoy having this book as well as the Megapack to re-read at my convience."},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"I was given this book by my father in the 1950's. I just renewed my reading of it thanks to the new e-book tablet craze. I have since read almost all of B.M. Bowers books. They are a great read for books that are close to 100 years old. Ms. Bowers writes about the start of the \\"Western\\" era and the tranportation changing to autos and the beginnings of movies.No shoot um up cowboy books but real life in Montana and other locals at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Chip Of The Flying U","review":"I read this book many years ago and it is still a fun read.It is from a time that is now far in the past."},{"Title":"Pioneer Aircraft: Early Aviation to 1914 (Putnam's History of Aircraft)","review":"Its refreshing to find a book that shows how many different people from far flung fields it took to finally build a workable aircraft. Yes the Wright Brothers played thier part but they did it by standing on the wealth of information created by others. The exciting period from 1908 to 1914 when every week breakthroughts and records tumbled is very well covered by this book! This is a must have book for any true student of early aviation.I am Steven Harvey author of IT STARTED WITH A STEAMBOAT and I greatly enjoyed this book and hope to read many of the other books writen by Putnam."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"Loss is a lifetime companion, though a topic that most of us feel uncomfortable discussing. This is especially true when a friend experiences a loss -- a shattered marriage, a serious illness, loss of a job, or even a death. We awkwardly offer consolation, impossible platitudes, and sometimes say nothing at all, because we just don't seem to know the most helpful words.This book reveals an authenticity that can come only from someone who has truly listened to those who have had their hearts broken. It respects another's heartbreak without offering simplistic solutions or outrageous theological directives. It allows readers to feel their feelings without having to &quot;fix&quot; them or put on a brave front. It's the kind of book you want to keep on a night table or in your purse to read over and over again.I highly recommend this book as a source of wisdom to keep for yourself or share with another. It is suitable for countless occasions when we feel helplessly short of consoling words but want to be a compassionate presence to another."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"I have bought many copies of this book over the years to give to friends and family who have lost loved ones. I always get excellent feedback from them about how much it helped them and that it was easy to go through when their minds were not processing well. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"I truly love this book and have given it to many friends who have lost love ones. I heard that it went out of print so I got on line and order 25 of them. Everyone who ever received one said it was very comforting at a most difficult time in their lives. If it has in fact gone out of print, I hope the publisher brings it back."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"As a fairly young widow, this book was given to me and has been my inspiration. I give it as a gift to those who are grieving the loss of my husband - as a sibling, a friend - when I have difficulty acknowledging their loss due to my own grief. I also send it to friends who are experiencing grief & loss of their own. It says what I can't say and enlightens them too accept that what they are feeling is \\"normal\\", (whatever \\"normal\\" is in grief). Beautifully written, calming, reassuring and full of compassion and love, this simple little book holds a powerful message."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"This is perhaps one of the best books I have read on grief and loss. It is short, simple and speaks to the heart. It offers a calming reassurance that all those things we are truly feeling as we embark on this uninvited journey are as they need to be. Perhaps one of the most treasured gifts we can offer is that of a listening presence, no judgment, no quick fixes and the willingness to hold that sacred place where one can go to heal on all levels. What I have discovered and what this book confirms are those times when a hug, a listening ear, a touch on the shoulder mean so much more than the most eloquent of words that are generally stated because of a deep discomfort of the one offering them. Give your loved one this book instead and it will speak to what is in your heart and find a way to theirs."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"I have given Mary Farr's book to a number of friends and relatives who have lost a loved one. I think it speaks to the sorrow, and the angiush of death. Some friends have told me how much it meant to them in the days and months following their loss."},{"Title":"If I Could Mend Your Heart","review":"This was given to me after I lost a loved one and was so comforting. It really speaks to the emotions and thoughts of early grief. I order these in bulk now, and as a hospice nurse I will pass along a copy to those family members who I feel would benefit."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"I actually bought two of these for Christmas gifts to go with two blue bird houses I had bought for Christmas gifts. I couldn't help but read almost all of the book before wrapping the two of them. This book is the perfect gift for anyone who has blue bird houses. It give the reader all the information needed to keep the blue birds 'happy' as far as cleaning, location, mounting and more. The book is filled with basic information any bird watcher would need as well as information to educate anyone who is just starting with blue bird houses."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"I found this book to be very informative. I have followed the info given and now have two Bluebird houses full of chicks. One female is on her second brood. Her first brood all lived and fledged. I keep an eye on the nests everyday ,as suggested , Do be careful of the parents because they will attack if you go to near the nestbox. I have a bump on my head to prove it. Do makesure they have access to water. They drink quite often and love to bathe. Food, ( mealworms are easy to find and they love them )Shelter, ( nestboxes ) and water, ( birdbaths )are the only requirements they need. I live in NH and have never been able to get them to winter here but I have a lot of berries ( sumac ) this year so will give another try.

The photographs are outstanding. Most of all, this book is a wonderful comprehensive collection of bluebird information: from learning more about this gentle creature to building boxes and monitoring them. There is also a helpful Bluebird Nest Recording Chart for nest-monitoring enthusiasts. The authors not only share their knowledge but also their love for the &quot;bird that carries the sky on his back.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"Once you have a bluebird visit your backyard, you WILL be hooked...and you'll start looking for anything and everything to lure them back--it sounds crazy, but I think every bluebirder started this way! I read just about everything I could find about them on the internet, and you can find tons of information there, but sometimes I'd rather consult a book or two--The Bluebird Book is one of my two.Actually it is pretty basic, and I thought it was too basic at times, but the further I read there was still a lot of good information about bluebird behavior, feeding habits, preferred habitat, nesting, nest boxes, predators of the bluebird, predator prevention, and what I didn't see anyplace else...bluebird language! But I think what kept me reading was the fantastic photographs--the photos will draw you in, and if you weren't too serious about doing the 'bluebirding thing', you will be after starting with this book. What it lacks in \\"complete reference\\" will certainly prompt you to take the next step of getting another more advanced book, pouring thru bluebird internet sites, or setting up a nest box or two in your yard. Just a note--depending on where you live in the US, parts of this book may not apply--but that is the same for other bluebird books also; don't get discouraged over it. Most bluebird books cover Eastern, Western, and Mountain bluebirds all at once, and what works in the east, may not work in the west, or south, for example.The other book that goes into great detail on just about everything bluebird related is the Bluebird Monitor's Guide. This should be your next book if you can find it. Excellent stuff, expands on what you learned in the Bluebird Book, and lists many lessons and lessons-learned, easy and hard, from average folks who became very passionate about bluebirds.After starting with the Bluebird Monitor's Guide, The Bluebird Book filled in a few areas and had some good detailed photos. And all the photos will have you wishing to have these beauties grace your neighborhood. Another note--there's also a Stokes video about bluebirding...I haven't seen it, but much of what I've read about it online is not very positive. Stick with this book and the Monitor's Guide and you will have plenty of solid information about bluebirds, setting up PROPER nest box(es), and providing a safe environment for a bluebird family, or any native wildbird family for that matter. Please be a responsible bird landlord!"},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"This is just one of the many popular bird books written by Donald &amp; Lillian Stokes. The &quot;Stokes Bluebird Book The Complete Guide To Attracting Bluebirds,&quot; in my opinion is one of the top Bluebird books now available. This page size glossy book, of 96 pages, has a as many color photos as it does pages.The written material is both easy to read and understand. And will be as interesting, and as educating for the beginner as it will be to the expert. The photos not only are exceptionally beautiful, but help to visually explain what has been written.The book is broken down into three sections. The Stokes write about the three types of Bluebirds. Then how you can attract the Bluebird by improving their habitat. And of course the best basic materials used with the Bluebirds in mind. Learn also about those birds who compete with the Bluebird, and also their predators. Then learn of the many areas of a Bluebird's behavior, like the how and the when of their breeding.If you want an easy to read book with all the Bluebird basics, plus the beauty of large, clear, up close Bluebird and other photos. This is a book you will want to add to your library."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"Great reference - gives information on everything from migration to nest site selection to nest building (and differentiating between BB and other bird nests), courtship behavior, what they do if one parent dies, raising the young etc. There's a new book out by Cornell's Lab of Ornithology (Bluebird Monitors Guide I think its called) and it takes all of the info here to the next level but I still come back to this one for the ease of use, straightforward info. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"This is certainly one you will want to add to your collection. Having been a birder for well over fifty years now, and a collector of books on the subject, I found this one to be well worth the cost. As pointed out by another reviewer here, some of the information in this book is quite basic. But that is okay! Everyone has to start somewhere and this is one of the best books I know to get that start. This is not to say that an \\"expert\\" will not be able to get anyting out of this work...that is silly. But, like any work on the subject of birds, this one needs to be supplemented by other books on the subject and field guides.The photographs in this work are wonderful, some of the best I have seen and the text is clear and concise, which is sort of a trade mark for this writing team. There is a great amount of useful information in this relatively small volume, and with it, and a couple of the other recommended works here, you should be able to become quite an authority on the subject. This particular bird is a favorite of mine and I find any work that promotes it's well being a good thing. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"Four bluebird houses and several bluebird feeders stand on our property, and I already own four bluebird books. Yet this bluebird book by Donald and Lillian Stokes looked like something I'd want to add to the collection.After buying and reading this classic bluebird \\"bible\\", I've moved this volume to the head of the class.The reader is treated to a myriad of glorious bluebird photographs and insightful information about eastern, western, and mountain bluebirds. Just about everything one would want to know about the bluebird lifestyle, diet, and interactions is in this book. I like that the authors include a suggested list of bluebird favorable plants, bluebird feeding habits, and even a plan for a simple bluebird house made with a single 1\\" x 6\\" plank of wood.Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book. The information within is just as pertinent now as it was the day the book was published. The magnificent bluebird photographs alone are worth the price of admission. I highly recommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"The Stokes bird books major in the sheer delight of discovering the bird in question. The 1991 STOKES BLUEBIRD BOOK carries this tradition forward without missing a step.The book's three sections explore 'The Birds', 'Attracting Bluebirds', an 'Bluebird Behavior'. The first section introduces this captivating bird by way of poetry and observations made about it, mostly when the species was more plentiful than it is today. The Stokes then present the 'Eastern', 'Mountain', and 'Western Bluebird' varieties.The second section details what we've learned about compensating for the habit destruction that has made Bluebird numbers drop precipitously in recent times. I bought my copy after undertaking the Quijote's quest of adding a bluebird house to my Indiana front yard. It was immediately fitted out by a male house wren whose spouse chose other digs.A final section, comprising nearly half the book's pages, follows these birds through their life stages.Through 96 pages, the authors' prose cannot veil their admiration for these birds and their sheer delight in sympathetic proximity to them.It all adds up to a winner."},{"Title":"The Bluebird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting Bluebirds (Stokes Backyard Nature Books)","review":"This book has great pictures and answered all of my questions re bluebirds.

I think it still sets the standard on the intimate relationship between sexuality and spirituality from Christian authors. Nelson rightly repudiates those in the Christian faith who want to claim spirit but not flesh, of which there are millions. His chapter on gayness and homosexuality remains the best in explaining the reasons the reasons for full acceptance in the Church. Though so-called conservatives will shout at the top of their lungs that there is liberal bias, it is clear to me that Nelson is simply trying to live out the Gospel as he sees it. In my view, nobody before or since has done it better in regards to the connection between sexuality and spirituality."},{"Title":"Embodiment: An Approach to Sexuality and Christian Theology","review":"I have read Embodiment and found it challenging. The author is well versed in the area of theology and Christian history. His purpose is to look honestly and clearly at the issue of human sexuality in the biblical context. What is refreshing, he takes psychology and sociology as tools to help him understand human sexuality. If we believe humans are the creation of the Creator, then we have to honestly look at them as they are in this creation. This book builds my faith, not tears it down; it also helps me think, not hide from things that might make me uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Embodiment: An Approach to Sexuality and Christian Theology","review":"I first read this work in the late '90's, and it revolutionized my views of sexuality and Christianity. I would highly recommend it to anyone who seriously struggles as a person of faith with intimacy issues.

Although written in the late '70's, the themes of this book read as though written for today--a must for every library!"},{"Title":"Embodiment: An Approach to Sexuality and Christian Theology","review":"Well-written from a scholarly viewpoint, this book is otherwise a challenging read with its pedantic style."},{"Title":"Forensic Science (Crime, Justice & Punishment)","review":"Crime is an ever present problem in our society. We read it in the newspapers, hear it over the radio and see it on the television. Have you ever wondered how a crime is solved? The yellow police tape and tv programs are cool but how is a crime solved besides the way we see it in the news?Our answer has come in this text which unvails beore us the tools of the trade in unraveling the physical mystery of crime. Forensic Science in its clear and concise prose takes us step by step through the physical processes use to solve crime scenes.I was fascinated by the technology and various disciplines used in obtaining and interpreting the physical evidence. Forensic science covers a multiplicity of discipline such as biology, medicine, etc. and applies them to the legal field. Forensic evidence can't be changed and in most cases can be the final nail in bringing a criminal to justice.If you share a curiosity regarding how crimes are solved in a detailed manner, this book is the one for you. It gives a broad general view of the discipline and makes us appreciative of the wide ranging team of law enforcement professionals who work in concert to solve baffling crimes through the use of science."},{"Title":"Halloween Fun: 101 Ideas to get in the spirit (Better Homes & Gardens)","review":"If you purchased Halloween: 101 Frightfully Fun Ideas (BH&amp;G), you have already seen most of the ideas in this new book.

The photography is still stunning and the pictures do inspire, but the crafts that are new in this edition have been done better in other books. If you don't own 101 FFI, than this book will really be a treat. The costumes are a small step above the other book, but still nothing to get excited about.

However, if you are looking for good Halloween decorating and party ideas that are a lot more elegant and adult-oriented, then I strongly recommend the Kasey Rogers (Louise Tate, from Bewitched) book: \\"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor.\\" It is well worth the money, or else try Martha Stewart's Halloween book. It is basically a compilation of several years' worth of her Halloween recipes, decorating, and costume ideas from the October issues of her magazine: \\"Martha Stewart Living.\\" Both of these books have decorating and party ideas that are a lot more oriented for those of us adults who still enjoy having fun on Halloween, while not being \\"cutesy\\" nor overly gorey, either."},{"Title":"Halloween Fun: 101 Ideas to get in the spirit (Better Homes & Gardens)","review":"This book was kindof fun, but a lot of the projects were just a little too cutesy for me.

Started with a copy of Shackles,years back, loved it, found the first novel Snatch, and have read every single novel up to/through Spook (Nightcrawlers will be found and started soon.)This is not prime Namesless. Pronini has semi-retired his Nameless Detective, bought in a new Op and tries to do a three part running narrative (with Bill, Jake and Tamara). Very poor decision, Pronzini. The strong single person narrative of Nameless, was the strength of the other novels; to \\"split off\\" the action and have Bill (aka Author) sitting in the narartive background to me was a major disppointment.I'll read Nightcrawlers next. But Bill, as in Bill Pronzini, don't do the split chapter narrative again, and if you must, two people mazimum. Nameless is a great character, if he wants Jake to take over, let him. But no more Nameless as Consultant; doesn't work for me."},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"Bill Pronzini's Nameless series of detective novels is perhaps the most underappreciated series in crime fiction history. It has been running since Nixon was operating a recording studio in the White House, and SPOOK is entry number thirty in this unique literary achievement. Mr. Pronzini almost chose to end the series with his previous Nameless novel--BLEEDERS. He didn't, and I am certain every reader, writer, and member of the worldwide mystery community is grateful. I know I am.SPOOK adds fresh twists to the Nameless series. Nameless is back, arranging for his semi-retirement with the same moral and ethical anchors that have been hallmarks of this character since the 1970s. He has given Tamara Corbin a full partnership in their agency, and they've hired a new operative Jake Runyon, a man with a troubled past. Kerry and their recently adopted daughter, Emily, are on hand preparing to celebrate Christmas.Subplots abound, yet the main storyline is engrossing. Nameless is hired to discover the identity of a murdered homeless man. The story involves long-buried crimes, and Mr. Pronzini uses Tamara's and Jake's narrative voices, in addition to the classic voice of Nameless, to tell the story.SPOOK is full of surprises and marks a privotal point in the Nameless series. I am thrilled that the series continues, and I hope that this book finally gets Nameless the wide public recognition/readership the character deserves. Wouldn't it be nice if TIME or NEWSWEEK paid homage to Bill Pronzini at this point in his career? It happened once to Ross Macdonald, as well as certain other crime fiction authors."},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"Detective Nameless, whose name is Bill, has reached the age of 61 and plays with the idea of retirement.

What is his identity? Our detective is hired to find out. First off, he hires a taciturn and depressed ex cop as the new investigator. And then the case starts to unravel in a most satisfying way.

The motivation is weak too. It'shard to believe the fellow who puts up the money to find Spook'skiller. Worse yet, the characterization is flawed. Tamara, Bill'snew associate is perfectly wooden in spite of Pronzini's attemptsto animate her.

I had thought that Pronzini's last novel, &quot;Bleeders&quot;, might have been his last &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; novel. Bill Pronzini is my favorite mystery writer working today, and I rejoiced when I found out that this wonderful series is continuing. Some changes have occcured in Nameless' agency. He has made his assistant, Tamara Corbin, his partner, and they have hired former Seattle cop Jake Runyon to do much of the leg work for the agency. Most of the novel is told by Nameless in the first person as always, but several chapters in which Tamara or Jake Runyon are featured are told in the third person. Pronzini makes this style work wonderfully. Steve Taradash hires the agency to find out the identity of a homeless man who was murdered outside his business. This man is known on the street as Spook, and he &quot;talks&quot; to people named Dot, Luke, and Mr. Snow. Jake Runyon does most of the leg work in Mono County, and finds out some very interesting facts. The reader learns about the private lives on both Tamara and Jake Runyon. I also enjoyed reading about Emily, the adopted daughter of Nameless and his wife Kerry. Sharon McCone, Marcia Muller's character, makes an appearance. Marcia Muller is Bill Pronzini's wife. &quot;Spook&quot; is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"This book contains a very nice plot, leading up to an excellent ending.

If you've liked any of the books in this series, you must read this one . . . because it is the beginning of much potential for the future.Nameless is back (and called &quot;Bill&quot;). He's in the process of moving towards retirement . . . beginning with semi-retirement. To facilitate the changes, he's taken his former assistant, Tamara, as his partner. They need to hire a new operative to help handle the street work that Nameless did in the past. After considering two potential men, Tamara insists that they hire Jake Runyon, a silent-as-the-grave ex-cop, ex-detective who looks like he's just lost his last friend.Jake turns out to be the kind of dandy character that Raymond Chandler would have been glad to write about. He loves the grime of the streets and the challenge of the chase. He's smart, tough, focused and self-contained. But he hurts, and his work is his therapy. You'll enjoy learning about him.The action in the book centers on the murder of a street person named Spook who talks to ghosts. I especially enjoyed the way that several people contributed to identifying Spook. It's imaginative problem solving at its best.Each of the detectives has personal issues that develop in interesting ways. Bill is having trouble deciding how to wind down his work and deal with his need to be a lone wolf. Tamara is shaken to the core when her boyfriend decides to move to Philadelphia and proposes marriage. Jake is looking to make a connection with his estranged son while grieving for his lost love.I don't want to say any more because the prose and story line are so smooth and balanced. You should be able to enjoy the development without interruption from me.Fans of Marcia Muller (Mr. Pronzini's wife) will be delighted to see that Bill and Sharon McCone end up working together on a case. It's neat!After you finish this wonderful novel, I suggest that you think about what you will regret if you don't change your ways. How can you begin making the necessary changes?"},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"The Nameless Detective is clearly starting to feel his age in this one. The gritty, rundown parts of the city are starting to depress him. So are the seedy and hopeless people he often has to deal with. This particular case involves the senseless and brutal murder of a homeless man named Spook. But instead of handling the case himself, as he has done for many years, Nameless has now enlisted the help of two assistants.One of his helpers is an assertive and streetwise black woman named Tamara who has become a full partner in Nameless's detective agency. In keeping with Tamara's promotion, several sections of the book are now seen through Tamara's eyes exclusively. Nameless has also hired an assistant named Jake Runyon, whose personal problems are reminiscent of the problems that Nameless himself has experienced in the past. Runyon, too, now has several sections of the book turned over to him.This is a somewhat startling change from previous Nameless novels, which were told through a first-person narrator who refused to reveal his own name. That meant everything that happened in previous novels was seen through the eyes and mind of this anonymous detective. Not so with this one.Like his other Nameless novels, however, Pronzini's hand is still the guiding force behind this long-lived series. And once again, he has filled the story with an interesting assortment of colorful characters with names like Pinkeye, Big Dog, and Lightfoot. He also includes a black classical cellist named Horace. And speaking of names, one of the surprises in this story is that Pronzini finally, subtly, and quietly reveals the name of Nameless.Typical of Pronzini's other novels, Spook has a number of interesting subplots that always add unexpected twists and turns to the story. One of the subplots in Spook includes both Nameless and another P.I. named Sharon McCone. What's interesting is that Sharon McCone is the lead character in another popular detective series, this one written by Pronzini's own real-life wife, Marcia Muller. So in this instance we have two fictional characters from two different P.I. series, and they're both working together on the same fictional case. It's kind of like having the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy working together to solve a bank heist.Pronzini is clearly one of the old-time masters of the hard-boiled P.I. genre. All of his characters are exceptionally well drawn, real, and true-to-life. His descriptions are brief, stark, and easy to visualize. And his well-structured, solid, and suspenseful framework will keep you turning the pages, long after you should have turned out the light.The saddest part of Spook is the realization that an excellent series is coming to an end. Don't miss this one. It's still Pronzini at his best.Russ Heitzwww.russheitz.com"},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"Bill Pronzini has in the Nameless Detective created a fihure who unlike many similar series protagonists ages as the series progresses and in this book he is 61 years old and on the verge of semi-retirement .To this end he and his streetwise young black partner Tamara engage another operative ,the troubled Jake Runyon .Runyan is still in a state of depression following the death through cancer of his second wife and has returned to San Francisco to try and rebuild a relationship with his gay son from whom he is estranged .The man case concerns the death of a harmless street person ,Spook ,who is murdered in the entryway to a low rent film company whose proproetor engages the agency to trace his identity .The bulk of the investigative work is undertaken by Runyan who , after encounters with the more violent and psychotic aspects of the homeless world ,in thr form of the vicious \\" Big Dog \\" traces the origins of the killing to an incident some 20 years previously in which 3 people were gunnned down in a remote Clifornia town .This not only points up the true identity of the deceased Spook but enables his slayer to be traced .This is polished and proficient in its unravelling but is not the only starnd to the book -there is a sub -plot which sees Nameless co-operating with Sharon McCone ( a creation of the authors wife ,Marcia Muller ) in acase exposing City corruption .Much of the book is taken up with the personal problems of Tamara whose relationship with cellist boyfriend Horace is in trouble ,and with Runyan' s situation as he tries to rebuild his lifeThere is an air of transition hanging over the book and it seems to be that Pronzini is about to retire his character and maybe start a new series cenred on Tamara and JakeIts a mellow and thoughtful book shot through with realistic compasssion and seems to point the way to a new development in the career of its prolific and reliable authorSatisfying as a mystery and a well wrought and compassionate study of lives in transition"},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"I really am enjoying getting into this series. Perhaps I am going about it in the wrong way, seeing as how I am starting with the last couple of books, rather than the first. But so far this has had zero impact on my ability to become engrossed with Pronzini and his gift at turning a tale. \`'Spook' and \`Bleeders' are the only two I have read thus far. \`Bleeders' was just great because of his quiet and unexpected ending. \` Spook' is on the other hand even simpler than \`Bleeders' in a lot of ways. And I like that. It's sort of a counter measure against all of the cookie cutter thrillers dealing with tired serial killer plots. \`'Spook' does let the reader down a little because it feels like Pronzini is slowly winding down his series here. It's my own fault for not starting in the beginning. It does have a little less character development or conflict than I would have liked, but hey, this is the 28th book.All I have really to say that this was a fun book to read. If you have read too many mysteries and thrillers like I have, I think that you will really enjoy getting into Pronzini.

In \\"Spook\\", Nameless, along with his soon-to-be partner Tamara and new field operative Jake Runyon, are trying to track down the identity of a murdered homeless man. Interspersed throughout the story are personal episodes of all three main characters. Nameless, one of the world's most socially shy butterflies, is persuaded to attend a Christmas charity event with of all people his old friend Sharon McCone and in the bargain saves her from losing a case. Tamara is faced with a huge decision: her boyfriend is pressuring her to marry him and move back east but she isn't sure she wants to give up a job she loves. Jake is still brooding over the death of his wife and the antagonism of his son. All this gives a new and warm twist to the usual Nameless books. To further add to the twist, Nameless's real name is slipped into the story several times! \\"Spook\\" is one of Pronzini's best!"},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"I love the Nameless series, and this review won't bore you by giving you the plot (again).The mystery itself is intriguing, but what I did not like about this book is the narrative breakdown to 3 parts--Nameless, Tamara and the new guy, Jake Runyon. The strength of the Nameless series is Nameless himself: his thought process, his brooding. You lose some of that with this book.Tamara is a bore. She's supposed to be so intelligent, with good business instincts, a computer hacker extraordaire. If I were a client contacting this agency for detective work, her bad attitude and nasty mouth would be enough to send me elsewhere. And I don't see how she could develop any working relationships with other agencies--she comes across as quite a b***h.I get the feeling Runyon (or should we call him Eeyore) is being groomed by Pronzini to take over the Nameless spot when Nameless (okay, Bill) retires. Quite frankly, I'm frustated with the whole daddy scene.This is not the Nameless we know and love. Dump the kid (Emily), fire Tamara, and get another woman for Jake..."},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"A homeless bum is found dead in the doorway of a company. Like many nameless denizens of the street he will be chalked up as another John Doe to be buried in a pauper's grave. The owner of the company decides this man shouldn't be forgotten. He calls on Nameless to investigate the death. His mission is simple, identify the name of the corpse, see that the family is notified, and do it in three days.Welcome back Nameless. A case that appears so simple and clear cut leads our favorite hero into the realms of murder and the world of the homeless. This time Nameless is not going at it alone. Now semi-retired our hero makes Tamara his partner in the business and hires a full-time operative named Jake. The lone \\"Wolf\\" now has a team that frees him up to be the husband to Kerry and father to Emily. Nameless is settling down. At least we think he his.Pronzini has introduced new blood into his old character who recognizes his limitations and is willing to allow others to take the lead. You see a mellow detective who takes on a mentoring/management role rather than being out there taking action on the streets. Such a change makes an interesting take on a detective that we think that we know so well.I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story as it exposed the good, bad and ugly side of homelessness. You gain an insight about what makes people fall apart to the point of being destructive to themselves and others. Each main character tells the story from his and her point of view which make the story more interesting.The major criticism that I have of Pronzini is his stereotyping of Tamara and Jake. Tamara is depicted as a loud mouth ignorant Black woman who can't get her love life together. Her attitude and dialogue is so stereotypical to the point of being unbelievable. Jake comes across as a younger version of Nameless. His personality is also too macho and wooden in his intereactions with others.Other than those two challenges the book is a good read. You will even find Nameless's name. Good Luck."},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"The Nameless Detective keeps plugging away, and although weary and battered, he keeps on keeping on. As do the terrific crime fiction novels written by Pronzini, still one of the most undderated writers in the genre. Along with the durable Nameless character and his acerbic but efficient assistant Tamara, we are introduced to another intriguing member of the agency, Jake Runyon. As usual, Pronzini gives these characters qualities that remind us of ourselves, and keeps us turning the pages. The homeless character \\"Spook,\\" which inspired the book's titles is yet another enigatic creation. Pronzini keeps his hit streak alive with this compelling novel."},{"Title":"Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel","review":"As a newcomer to Pronzini's Nameless Detective, my reaction may differ from serious fans, but overall I found this work very enjoyable. The plot seemed rather thin & straightforward to me, but the characterizations (though to a degree stereotypical) were engaging as were the characters themselves. In this work the author divides the chapters among 3 characters' activities (which he lists at the start of the chapters)--I can't fault someone for trying out a different approach. I thought it worked out okay--and it may be indicative of a shift in the author's intentions for future novels as well. I did very much enjoy his inclusion of a cross-over (similar to TV between two similar program series--there was just one on CSI (part 1) and Without a Trace (part 2) recently. This cross-over subplot was with his wife Marcia Muller's protagonist Sharon McCone including most of her supporting cast as well. Muller also sometimes includes references and appearances of Nameless in her books. I think I've read all of them--they're great IMHO. That's why I picked up this Pronzini--who dedicated this book to her. By the way, they've written three terrific books (Duo (Five Star First Edition Mystery Series),Double : a \\"Nameless Detective\\" Sharon McCone Mystery, &Beyond the Grave (Pronzini, Bill)) and edited several story collections (e.g.She Won the WestandWitches' Brew: Horror and Supernatural Stories by Women (Macmillan midnight library)) together."},{"Title":"The Cherry Tree","review":"Gabriele Wohmann knows how to entertain - and she knows how to look behind the scenes.

I have felt as if I was under a curse.Sure enough. I have been living under the control of an treacherous,inner tyrant. My own ego. Even though I tried to find relief in scriptures, prayers, practices, shamanic rituals, affirmations, creative expression, bodywork, those activities never addressed the real cause of the suffering.I CHING: ORACLE OF THE COSMIC WAY shows me an entirely different perspective. Now I can sometimes sense the decaying presence of my own ego. I can almost feel the muscles of my trueself, the person I really am, in comparison with the flimsey costumes of the ego masquerading as me. Now sometimes, I can clearly tell the difference between the two.How can a book bring about such an awareness? First of all, I CHING;ORACLE OF THE COSMIC WAY is not a book. Yeah, it looks like one and you DO read it. But it's really a kind of intimacy with one's own Wisdom, the Sage, a presence that the ego cannot manipulate and colonize.The Sage answers clearly when I throw the Three Coins, usually in the written Hexagrams, and sometimes in the &quot;stillest, smallest Voice&quot; I ever heard. If I don't understand, I just ask for clarification and throw the coins until I do. The Appendix provides remarkably clear definitions and amazingly effective processes for working with the Sage.Three things are delightful about working with this version of the I CHING: (1) It has surgical precision that cuts straight to deep, deep difficulties. Right to the marrow. And yet (2) the process is kind and gentle, and (3) I feel relieved and satisfied with the results.So how is this accomplished? This book teaches how to say NO! and how to say YES! to one's own life in such a way that the ego is diminished and the trueself is nourished. This book also teaches that the commonsense we all enjoyed as young children is really who we are and what we have to work with. Right now as adults.My copy of I CHING:ORACLE OF THE COSMIC WAY has become my favorite belonging. It is such a relief to experience, once again, that life is as wonder-full as I thought it was, way back before preschool. This is especially helpful during current national and world events.I invite you to buy this book and spend time with the Sage.
