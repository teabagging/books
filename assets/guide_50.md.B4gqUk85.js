Not only was the plot well developed and held a lot of surprises, but the individuals in the novel were well described and felt real. The writing flowed and made the reading easy but not simplistic. I certainly would buy Diana Dempsey's next novel. One other thing that really impressed me was the editing...the spelling and grammar as well as the set-up were well done, something other free novels sometimes ignore."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I downloaded this as a free kindle book for my iPad and really enjoyed it.

Overall I enjoyed the book but found that it was very predictable. I agree with the other post that I wasn't necessarily rooting for Natalie as I was rooting against all the \\"villians\\" of the book. I wanted Kelly to get what was coming to her, and for Tony to be seen as the scumbag he is.I didn't feel like any of the characters really learned their lessons and accepted their mistakes. Even Natalie didn't show any real remorse for her poor decisions. In the end, everyone got what was coming to them but they never really evolved as characters."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"At first, I thought this book was going to be too Hollywood for my liking, but once I got a few chapters along I found myself liking the main character Natalie and the story line.

She is dealing with a separation from her husband, her career is going down the tubes and she is struggling to find a new one.

I liked Natalie and appreciate the struggles of an older woman in a career where youth and beauty means a lot. But, there's so much boring, unimportant filler that you have to trudge through to get to the good parts. It seems like, in the middle of a conversation, there appears a big descriptive few paragraphs or inner monologue you have to get through to finish the conversation. It really was hard to get through this book.And the ending! Ugh. I felt like half the plot was left unresolved. It definitely needed more. Less filler in the rest of the book and more at the end."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"this book was predictable,and took too long to get to a point, usually i like long books but this one was not really worth the time as it did not keep me interested"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I thought the writing was very good, but way too lengthy. There were a lot of paragraphs that didn't lend anything to the story, so toward the end I started skimming, because I was interested enough to want to see how it all ended. One thing the author did that became more and more obnoxious was she titled each chapter with the day spelled out, the month, and the time.Example: Tuesday, October 1, 12:18 PMSince I always read in bed just before I sleep, I always felt that I needed to get up and write this down, as I would forget it by the time I read the first paragraph of each chapter. I always thought that it must be important information, and because I couldn't remember, maybe I was missing out on a clue, or a puzzle piece that was pertinent to the story. It was very annoying. (and I never did write it down.)The main character was someone that I really didn't care what she did in the end. I can see why many readers would enjoy this story however. I couldn't decide whether to give it 3 or 4 stars, so I recommend you read it for yourself, it will educate you about the news industry."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I I downloaded this on my new kendle fire e reader.

I will give it three stars just for having a plausible plot. However, the character development was raw and unfinished. The heroine Natalie's boss making sudden use of a racial slur midway in the book was not okay. It didn't fit his previous characterization. In fact at the beginning of the book he seemed like a believable businessman, albeit a shark. But toward the end, Tony Scoppio became the consummate guido stereotype. The lines of his character and many others were unclear or changed as the book progressed.Geoff the Aussie agent was likeable, and mostly a side-liner until he slowly (at a snail's pace) became the heroine's love-interest. That relationship should have been established long before the middle of the eighth or ninth chapter in my opinion. They've been in a working relationship for over a decade, and yet he knows nothing about her personal life until he takes her out for her fortieth birthday (inconceivable). He was all agent and business interests, and then suddenly they're sleeping together? And the \\"love story\\" angle was not very believable-- Geoff reasons she's too old early in the book and also past childbearing age. But then he's in love with Natalie in the end of the book after jilting a younger woman for acting like a woman and getting excited about a wedding? He comes off looking like a user and a jerk. No dice for the love of a lifetime.The heroine Natalie was a weak, childish and vapid woman at times during the beginning of the story, instead of the hard-ball playing woman she'she becomes in the end of the novel (with Ruth or Berta's help of course). And as a character she's never proactive unless stalking someone for a scoop. In the beginning she had integrity fighting to do news on the scene of a real disaster, but her shining moment disappeared when she began making rookie mistakes and then didn't even mention her husband's obvious adultery when fighting for her divorce. Weak.And when Geoff indicated he was seeing someone (after they'd slept together), she had the absolute wrong reaction in claiming to be the jealous woman like it wasn't her who was using someone else's man or her that was the duped woman. And whether Janet (Geoff's girlfriend ne fiance) was likeable or not in anyone's eyes, Natalie had no leverage at that point, unless she didn't continue to associate with him. At best she was a second string love interest. And Janet is a confusing point-- someone Natalie may or may not have already known about (at one point in the book she knew about Geoff's on-again/off-again relationship and at another she's taken by surprise).If the heroine had pointed her anger at the guy, that's one thing. But to aim it at the guy's girlfriend was stupid. She might as well have given him permission to be a slimeball. What should have surprised her more was her own ability to jump into bed with someone who's not even been on her romantic radar until that particularly low point in her life. When he treated her to dinner for her birthday she was too busy playing the wounded bride-- while her husband shows up with a woman at the same restaurant (how trite). Seems a mite selfish, but that might just be me. So I guess it all boiled down to my not liking the characters of the book, though I read to the very end. It wasn't really for me. And I'm not going to be reading more unless I get it on good authority that the book is worth my time."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I decided to try reading this book because of the glowing reviews, but in order to carry a reader along, one has to care about at least one of the characters. None of these characters are even likable. Then, as others have pointed out, this book needs a good editor. Since I was an editor up until a few years ago, it irked me that there were so many misspellings and grammatical errors, even use of wrong words in some sentences, and run-on sentences or incomplete phrases and sentences. This writer needs to link up with a really good editor, as it's obvious she doesn't know how to write a decent sentence. Further, if she writes another book, she needs to make some character in the book, preferably the protagonist, likable. I am about 50 percent into the book and am thinking I am just going to stop reading it; it isn't worth my time."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Rarely have I come across a book that I can't finish. This is one of them. It is just bad. I truly hate when the female lead is supposed to be an intelligent woman and the is just ridiculously stupid."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Overall all a light, quick read. I enjoyed it but there were quite a bit of grammatical errors. I liked the plot behind the story and the character development was decent."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I keep trying and trying to get into this book and just can't. The plot idea is good, but I can't stand the characters. The heroine/underdog Natalie, comes off more as weary and run-down. Kelly is less of a love-to-hate but instead just immature, obnoxious and annoying. There is not a good connection/explanation of back story to Evie. I dislike Geoff and can't see what Natalie would even like about the guy. Anyway, I keep picking the book back up in hopes it will get better, but I'm at chapter 11 and still can't get into it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The book was alittle wordy, but overall very entertaining. Good book I enjoyed reading it. Sometimes you just need light reading material."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book is so well writtem... Nothing was the obvious and it all made sense, with the right timing for each character to be written in. Natalie had the same feelings most of us do when we get fortyish, not knowing 40 is very young until we get past that age and find out differently. This book is a \\"Five Star\\""},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this mystery about a Mrs. America contestant who also solves mysteries. The characters are fun and the plots are clever. I hope the author continues publishing these light mysteries."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"as a new Kindle owner I was downloading material to get familiar with the process. Romance novels are not my thing, but the title and preview grabbed me. This book was a very good read, fun, fast, interesting. We have a reporter / anchor in the family, so it struck a real chord. GREAT job Diana, I look forward to reading your other books. Thanks to Amazon for making this first one 'free'."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Interesting look at what is behind those faces we look at every night on our local news. We know the ratings drive many decisions about who we watch, and what stories we will hear, but we may not know all the machinations that go on behind the scenes. In \\"Falling Star\\", we meet several expected stereotypes, and even though the basic story line takes a predictable path, it is how the story is told that determines the enjoyment level. This book is very well written, and kept my interest, wondering which path it would follow next. Little things make the reading effortless and pleasant. For example, a discussion about VC had Natalie mentally reminding herself that VC's common use is \\"Venture Capitalist\\", not the old \\"Viet Cong\\" from her early days as a reporter. I thought it was a subtle way to make sure the reader knew what was being discussed.The story line peaks were moderate, not extreme, and it did seem to slow down a bit in the middle before the action picked up again. There was consistency in the characters - once they were portrayed as a diva, or a sleaze ball, or a hard working, dedicated professional, that characterization never cracked. Maybe a hint of an occasional lapse in the portrayal would have added a bit of spice."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"\\"Natalie Daniels's husband just dumped her.

It had me captured from the first page. Yes, there were a few typos and I don't like that either, but it was well written and enjoyable, so I'll forgive the editing mistakes. I'm going to look for more by this author."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I found \\"Falling Star\\" to be an entertaining read. It kept my interest and introduced me to the world of television newscasts. I found myself comparing the characters to my local newscasters. It helped me to realize what a competitive business television newscasting is."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Good story. It sucks you in and grips you throughout the book even though the end was a bit of an anti climax. I love the fact that the story centres around greed and the lengths people will go through to get what they want but most importantly I love that the writer focussed on age discrimination against women in the work force. Those who read erotic romance please beware. This book does not fall under the tag \\"erotic\\" even though it has been labelled thus."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I like a couple of other readers just could not get through the book and stopped reading it. There were many typos and editing issues and the storyline bored me to tears...I'm glad I did not pay for it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Yes, I downloaded this story because it was free and it's not always easy to know what you're going to get - I enjoyed it. I don't read these kinds of stories usually and I was pleasantly surprised. I really like the Natalie /Miles thread - but I won't give spoilers.Well written.Worth a look."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The most interesting parts of this book were the details about the television news industry, but the plot was quite believable. Natalie's (our heroine)character was lovely, but not as fun and developed as her antagonists, and it was their antics that were the most entertaining of the book. It was unclear to me how Natalie ever made it to the top of her field, given her somewhat naive reactions to all that takes place around her, and her uber-dependence on her agent, her lawyer and her producer that made her seem very vulnerable---not typically the personality of a news anchor. In Natalie's world, alls well that ends well, but only because other people took care of her."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This is probably on the the best of the 66 books I have read since I bought my Kindle. I have read Peterson, Grisham, and Graham. Good books but this had the same quality and it was at considerable less cost. The ending is much better than most endings, it takes a few chapters to unravel. I do not want to discose the ending. Well worth the price. I will be buying more of her low cost books and save the gas to the library and that of the more popular authors."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I got this book for my kindle, mostly because it was under the category romance/contemporary and it was free. Unfortunately, it seems that it was added incorrectly to the romance category because there was barely a hint of romance in the story.However, that did not stop me from reading the whole thing. Though it was a bit predictable, the story was intriguing enough to keep me going all the way through. The writing style was enjoyable and had an easy flow yet gave a definite understanding of which character's perspective was being shown at all times.I noticed that around chapter 17 or so, I began to feel overwhelmed by the lack of any good news at all in Natalie's life. Without any rays of sunshine at all, the book began to feel like a major downer, so much so that I considered putting it down and not bothering to go back to it. It took effort for me to trudge through to the end of the book, but I did because by this point in the story, I felt I needed to see things work out alright for Natalie. While reading, I found this to be distracting personally, and I was not happy about it, but when I finished the book and looked back, I felt like I'd been through the ringer with Natalie and come out on the other side. It was a unique experience. I can't say I enjoyed the experience, but I was certainly captivated enough by the writing to continue on with it so that says something about the writer's skills, in my opinion.I might not recommend this book to anybody, but I am glad I read it, it was a decent debut for Diana and she should be proud of it.(Though Diana, if you are reading these reviews, please be sure to find a competent editor next time, the one you used for this book did you no favors when it came to copy editing. There were numerous mistakes with spelling and wrong word choice and inconsistent spellings of names etc.)"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book on the surface is about the clash between young and not-so-young reporters, as well as a minor story about what is romance in a person's life. But underneath, it's a story about the changes that occur when people hit middle age. It's about taking expectations that we have about where a person should be and what they should be doing regarding lifestyle and image, and getting over it and dealing with what is real and right for yourself.Natalie Is an almost 40 news anchor, with a new station manager. Tony was hired to bring ratings up and costs down - and will receive a bonus if he can do it quickly. One of the fastest ways to do that is to lower or get rid of high salaries, even if these are the people with experience to do the job right. And, in the world of television, to add eye-candy and maybe dip into the infotainment cesspool, which describes Kelley, the up-and-coming reporter. Tony has an incentive to meet short-term goals and the long-term can wait until later. On top of that, Natalie's estranged husband is trying to sue for divorce and half of the community property - after he comes over to \\"make up\\" and the pre-nuptial agreement mysteriously disappears. Can Natalie roll with the punches or will she be steamrolled by circumstance?As some people have said, there are some typo and grammar errors, but for the most part I didn't find them too distracting. There are times that I thought the story dragged a bit and I found myself skimming over some of the filler when rehashing some of the storyline. But I thought that the exploration of people reinventing themselves, especially in the current economic climate, was fascinating, as well as the contrast between image versus substance. If only more workplace conflicts played out like this. I can see this story appealing more to older readers who can connect with Natalie's character and the challenges she faces, rather than the twenty-somethings who may not see anything wrong with Kelley's actions. 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Diana Dempsey gives us FALLING STAR, about Ms. Dempsey's field, television news. Is it that cut throat and all the on air smiles just cover the jealousy? It was ok, an ok read. Wanted to know more from the characters and wonder how much the simply falling in bed happens. Didn't really feel for them. Really a nice read for free, might try another of her books."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Its a great book!

It was interesting learning more about the behind the scenes of a local TV news station."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"A quick read about life behind the camera in television news in a big market. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you wondering. Clever antics bring a smile as you encourage revenge against the soon-to-be ex-husband. Add to that the fight for women to avoid age discrimination in order to still stay as television news anchors and you get Falling Star. How far would you go to get an interview? How low of a position would you maintain in your fight to stay in prime time? Kick your shoes off, get comfortable, grab a cold drink and enjoy this amusing tale."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Set in LA, this book was a bit different from the normal Los Angeles books as it didn't follow movie stars and instead went behind the scenes in the News world and came from the viewpoint of anchors, news directors, etc. I found that refreshing, as it was a change of pace.However, news anchors aren't the superstars that they were in previous generations, so I found it kind of humorous how the young \\"villian\\" was going through so much trouble to become the anchor and acheive star status, scoffing at some tv starlets at a party and saying how she deserved to be rich and famous when in fact perhaps she should have tried to be a movie/tv starlet HERSELF if she wanted that fame.The story comes from the point of view of multiple characters, letting you in on their frame of mind, schemes, and thoughts on one another. The main character is Natalie Daniels, an experienced news anchor who has won numerous awards and is the primetime anchor at her station. However, changes are happening and the news director wants to replace her (and large salary) with a younger sexier girl to pull in viewers. Enter in Kelly, the girl that Natalie mentored and even let live in her house who has the mind of a sociopath. She will stop at NOTHING to secure the anchor spot, but Natalie didn't realize that until too late.This was a great read to find out just what lengths they would go to remain/get on top. Other characters involve Geoff, Natalie's agent who seems absolutely gorgeous (um hello, australian accent!) and has to make some important decisions about his personal life and work world that will all affect Natalie. Kelly is the young skank previously mentioned who is trying to work her way up in the apparently cutthroat news world, making some downright scary decisions in her quest to be top dog. Natalie's sniveling husband was my least favorite character, that dude got under my skin and I have no idea how she remained married to him for so long. In the book, they are going through a divorce and his selfish narcissism is all too apparent now that her rose colored glasses of love are off. The things he does in the book will make you want to punch him in the nose!I thought the book touched on the ageism of Hollywood, work issues, tangled life webs, and much more quite nicely. The ONLY thing that I had a problem with was that Natalie seemed like such an admirable character who despised adultery (happened to her more than once) and yet she cheats with someone? It just seemed out of character for her considering how she acted the whole rest of the book. And she had no qualms whatsoever about doing so when her conscious seemed to be morally sound about everything else. That just seemed like a leap for her character.I give the book a 4.5 out of 5 stars and really enjoyed it. This was the debut novel for the author and I'd read more of her work!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"A wonderfully delightful read... never a dull moment throughout the book, with a great balancing finish to the plot at the end of the story. Interesting plot; lots of interplay between the characters, super writing!

The characters are realistic and interesting as are the plot and multiple sub-plots, which are masterfully woven at a crisp pace. If everything in your life has ever gone wrong at the same time, you will relate to this story--and, perhaps, to its examples of the frustrating self-destruction that can accompany shaken confidence.

Then I bought a Kindle. And how happy am I? Very.The writer isn't skittish when showing stress bringing out hidden personality traits and muddled thinking in both the heroine and her nemisis. Fully expecting a quick downfall and a quicker return, I was pleasantly surprised when the author fleshed out the characters as they struggled.

Oh and cut Natalie's salary by 80%.

First of all, much of the specific information about resources for publication has to do with the UK (the author is British). There are some useful general pointers at the beginning of each chapter about having projects published, portfolios, etc, but the author doesn't really address those things in the rest of the text. As a writer, this guy's a dud. Also, for my taste, the photography isn't very interesting. Bleh. This is the only photo-related book I've purchased that I've regretted.

To hear Lamb's story is to laugh, cry, and seriously consider getting a job at a 24/hour diner just to have a glimpse of the crazy antics like those at Sanderson's. The reader will cheer with the successes, be crushed at the defeats, and empathize with every emotional state Lamb was in at the time. If you are a KC native, you are doing yourself an injustice to overlook this outstanding work. It is a little piece of history and a small masterpiece of nonfiction"},{"Title":"Sanderson's Lunch","review":"I enjoyed the book but would like to see more articles telling more of the wacky tales of the old 24 hour restaurant, perhaps in a newspaper or KC mag.

The intro to each model year is very brief and then goes straight into VINs and paint codes. I also don't like how the options and prices are written in paragraph form instead of as a list. That makes it difficult to compare between model years.However, my biggest complaint are the book's \\"quality control\\" errors. There are a few spelling errors and there are no less than 10 pictures that are mislabled (example: a magnetic red convertible labled as an electron blue Z06). The price guide section also inexplicably contains the header: \\"The prices listed here represent a sample of British sports cars imported to North America, taken from the 2004 Old Cars Price Guide.

Second point: The title is somewhat misleading. This is NOT a primer on how to collect, propogate, cultivate and design with native plants in the garden. While it is filled with interesting and useful information on the plants it describes, those looking for pictorial, step-by-step, truly &quot;how-to&quot; information should consult other reference books. It also focuses on plants found in the mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., so readers in other areas may find even less useful information for their own gardens.All hint of misleading titles aside, however, this is a great book to read for one man's perspective on environmental destruction and salvation. Written by Mr. Bruce during a transition period in our environmentalist evolution - between the ecology/flower child movements of the 1960s and early 70s (remember the closed, green &quot;E&quot;?) and the rise of the prairie restoration, Nature Conservancy, rainforest protection, and other highly-organized, politically-correct movements of the 1980s and 90s - it is a plea for people to open their eyes to the beauty and potential loss of the environments that surround them. Using the changing seasons as his backdrop, Mr. Bruce takes us with him on a year-long, three-times-per-week, 90-mile commute through the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia countryside that he refers to as &quot;Delmarva&quot;. He tells us about the flora and fauna he sees on these drives, and then goes into great description of their attributes, their relationship to the environment, and the history of their development and distribution. He then shares idea for how these plant materials can not only be preserved from destruction, but how they can be best used in our own gardens, large and small.Throughout, the author writes with a passionate, personal, engaging perspective on these plants and the people that protect them, never hesitating to criticize plant features he dislikes, but glowing in praise of their attributes and value. It is an enjoyable read, a four-season visit to a beautiful place, with an excellent traveling companion."},{"Title":"How to Grow Wildflowers and Wild Shrubs and Trees in Your Own Garden (Horticulture Garden Classic)","review":"By far the best advice about growing wild trees, shrubs and flowers native to the eastern United States. For anyone who wants to naturalize woodland borders or ponds, streamsides and meadows, or who simply wants to grow beautiful native plants that are available from specialty nurseries but not often found in neighborhood garden centers. The description of wild, fragrant native azaleas is unsurpassed. Because Hal Bruce's personal experience was in gardens of the Mid-Atlantic states, his understanding of plants and habitats is particularly useful for gardeners in the Atlantic coastal plain."},{"Title":"How to Grow Wildflowers and Wild Shrubs and Trees in Your Own Garden (Horticulture Garden Classic)","review":"I have not read this entire book, but perused enough to have concerns - beginning with the cover. The flower pictured is Nigella damascena and it is NOT a North American native. Many people are confused about Wildflowers/Natives. They are not interchangeable words. Although the author does not use the term &quot;native&quot; in his title I see that other people reviewing this book are - adding to the confusion. Just my thoughts :)"},{"Title":"The Incredible Thrilling Adventures of the Rock","review":"Michael O'Donoghue was hugely important to the original Saturday Night Live and to National Lampoon.

It's the story of a rock in a forest who is depressed at his location/situation. I suppose the theme of the book could be a metaphor for our lives, but it's not as funny if you look at it that way. The ending of the book is definitely the best part because it's not really what you would expect."},{"Title":"Crazy Like A Fox (Louisiana)","review":"Anne Stuart is amazing! She can take characters and make you love them so much that you never want the story to end. This is one of those stories. And this book is filled with characters who you wish you never had to say goodbye to. Peter is crazy (in love), smart, sexy and witty. Margaret is attracted to Peter despite his reputation for being a 'lady killer'. A fierce tigress trying to keep her wits about her, her daughter safe and herself sane in a house full of nutty relatives, she is a character you can wholeheartedly root for. The Mardi Gras scenes are enough to make you wish you were there. This remains my favorite of Anne Stuart's many wonderful stories, for the humor, the mystery and most especially for the romance between Peter and his Marguerite! A definite keeper!"},{"Title":"Crazy Like A Fox (Louisiana)","review":"This books has it all. Southern atmosphere, a dysfunctional family, lots of secrets... Oh, yeah, and a hero suspected of being an insane killer. Now is that Gothic or what?One thing that makes this stand apart from many of the old Gothics is that the heroine is strong. She has to be to put up with this family. Also, there are sensual love scenes.My only regret was that this wasn't one of Anne Stuart's longer romances.

Peter, under house arrest for a murder he didn't commit, is so vulnerable you can't help but love him. Margaret, battered widow, homeless, single mom sees the potential in her late husbands sweet but sad cousin. My heart was with Margaret every step of the way, particularly at the voodoo madam's grave sight where, with all her life is lacking, she uses her one wish to ask for Peter's sanity. Peter in turn risks all, even his life, to be with the women he loves. The sexual tension between these two is only the beginning. This is not your run of the mill romance. With convoluted plot and serious obstacles to overcome, you can't help but pray these two make it. Anne Stuart is a master who knows how to create empathy with her hero's and heroines (in spite of their dark secrets)."},{"Title":"Crazy Like A Fox (Louisiana)","review":"This is a very unusual read. It's like taking a trip to the &quot; big easy&quot; with a very entertaining family! Peter, (the crazy one) is under house arrest, when Margaret comes to stay. She, and her daughter might be the cure that Peter needs. The mystery, sexual tension, and the fun of Mardi Gras add to the spice of this great book. It truly is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Crazy Like A Fox (Louisiana)","review":"Do not judge this book by its cover. Honest, the hero is not an ape-man. To be fair, the heroine might well have had big hair--it was written in 1989, and, well, a lot of us had big hair then. We didn't know any better. The cover of the reissue has better-looking people, but it has nothing to do with the story, unless it's trying to show us what happens after the story ends. Yes, they do end up at Mardi Gras, but not like that, and not with the kid. Also, the kid is a girl, and that sure looks like a boy to me.So, the cover gods used to have it in for Anne Stuart. But she showed them. She put a fabulous story inside anyway.When the book opens, Margaret Jaffrey, widowed and destitute (her husband was a gambler, and not a very good one), decides as a last resort to take her daughter Carrie to Louisiana, to Dexter's family home. From there, the story is pure gothic.There's the extended family with the forceful matriarch, the big house, the gothic atmosphere, the mystery, but most of all there are the cousins Peter and Wendell. Both are handsome, in the same way Dexter had been, but Wendell is a charming lawyer, and Peter is cynical and unemployed... because he's under house arrest, kept locked in the attic (okay, a suite of rooms on the top floor), after being acquitted of his wife's murder by reason of insanity.Margaret finds herself drawn into the family's web, blocked every time she tries to assert her independence, and unsure of their safety when the whole family seems convinced that Peter is dangerously insane. However, she's reluctant to take her daughter from the happiness and stability she's found after so many months of living hand-to-mouth. Wendell has given her a job, and offered a marriage proposal her mind tells her would ensure Carrie's and her futures, though her heart says otherwise.For such a short book (typical Harlequin--251 pages), a lot is packed into it. Each member of the family has an agenda, and you're never quite sure what's true. There's intrigue and the mystery surrounding Peter's wife's death, and in the middle of it all, Margaret is falling in love with the very worst choice--a crazy man who'd confessed to killing his wife.I'm slowly collecting Anne Stuart's backlist, but there are so many books that it's been slow going. This book convinces me to try to speed up the process a bit."},{"Title":"Crazy Like A Fox (Louisiana)","review":"Peter Jaffrey is a hunk. But, he's also a killer; isn't he? Margaret is destitute, and worried about her daughter; before, she is even willing to meet her dead husband's family.

Add to the mystery, a masquerade, Mardi Gras, a family mansion, weird relatives; you really have a marvelous old-time gothic."},{"Title":"Alone Together; A History of New York's Early Apartments","review":"This superb book explains how well-to-do New Yorkers were reluctant to move into apartment buildings, and how that resistance was overcome through clever design and marketing tactics. Cromley begins by discussing early Parisian apartment buildings and the earliest tenements in New York City. These two historic strands came together in the 1870s, when apartment buildings for the affluent, known as 'French flats,' appeared as a new building type for New York. Cromley highlights the social history of the era - what life was really like for the people (especially the women) who lived there, as distinct from their counterparts in single-family houses. Among the still-extant classic buildings discussed are the Dakota (1884), the Osborne (1885), and the Ansonia (1902). In all, the book covers the mid-1800s to 1911; there is nothing here about the 1920s building boom following WWI. The book is generously illustrated with about 30 floor plans and about 50 engravings."},{"Title":"A Covenant for All Seasons","review":"What a great tool!

It is about degrees of shame (to the point of debilitating shame), ways that children are shamed, the consequences, characteristics of adults shamed as children and a lot more. One specific topic that I found extremely interesting was the explanation of grandiosity as a response to debilitating shame, which makes this book required reading for people with this symptom (such as alcoholics and families; bipolars may also benefit).

She told me that it made her \\"cry for the child within her.\\" I thought that any book that had such a powerful affect as this, must be a book I should read.I ordered the tape and book edition. I listened to the tape version first (which was of the author talking to an audience about the content of this book), and then I read the book. The two together were quite powerful. The most interesting thing about this book was that it differentiates between \\"guilt\\" and \\"shame.\\" The author says that often we use the two interchangeably. But the author says that they are actually two different things.

I especially like the fable she use in chapter one to illustrate the giant chameleon and perfect personalities and how they interact in a family. The illustration of Giant and Chameleon on oposite ends of the spectrum and the human being in the healthy middle was very insightful.

I found myself relieved after finishing this book because for once someone finally put into words what goes on in reality in our inner worlds in practical, concise and work-able terms. I highly recommend this book to every one so you may discover the signs of how we sometimes decide to not face, feel or free shame and guilt. If we do not grasp the masters of disguise that influence us to behave on the surface to fulfill other agendas; our lives will continue to unconsciously spin out of control and we will not know where or why we were lead astray.What personally struck me was remembering how I suffered for a long time extreme shyness, embarrassment and feelings of being inferior to others. There was a time in my life that it was most desirable for my circle of influence for me to stand by with a smile on my face and say nothing. There was a time in my life that I was isolated for articulating how disconnected my perception was from the larger crowd. This isolation served as means for others to punish me with shame and guilt or hide from their own shame and guilt."},{"Title":"Shame & Guilt: Masters of Disguise","review":"You have to get through the first chapter and the book is good.

You may not even realize that you were shamed or guilt ridden, because I didn't look at my youth like that. My parents still think this is the correct way to teach children, and they've even wanted me to raise my children under these incorrect ways. I've refused to raise my children like I was raised, and it actually makes my parents really angry with me. My counselor recommended this book to me, and I am so glad that I'm reading it! It is sure changing the way I feel about myself as a human being. I am learning that I don't have to be or do everything perfectly to be accepted into society. That issue all by itself has made continued to haunt and stress me out. I highly recommend this book if you have any of the issues listed above regarding how this book can help yourself, your siblings, or your friends. It will open a whole new world for anyone who, like me, doesn't feel like they fit in, have self esteem issues from childhood, or isolate themselves from the outside world.

This is by far the most intelligent book ever written on LISP.The book starts with the basics of symbolic computing, and then moves on: a detailed analysis of syntax (without taking any shortcuts on sexprs), interpretation, [a hasty introduction to] the lambda calculus, denotational semantics (!), compilation and code generation, the top-level and the run-time environment, including garbage collection. Special emphasis is placed on imperative LISP. All this described in 446 pages of a single book. This book packs about 5-6 different university courses in a single volume! The level of the discussion is high, there are plenty of examples of real code, but thankfully the author avoids many of the pitfalls of later books on Scheme and functional programming: (1) He doesn't employ the \\"running example\\" approach to writing computer books: Each example is small, very focused, and the discussion remains academic. (2) Formalisms are explained in quasi-mathematical lambda-notation, rather than by dumping source code on the poor reader.This is a very rich source. The book discusses issues that other authors typically punt: labels and goto, side effects on constants (this is the ONLY book that mentions a problem known as The Anomaly of Quote), etc.This is an old book, and it does not mention hygienic macro systems, continuations, object orientation, and other more recent topics.

Anne Perry has proven this time and again with her William Monk series, and she does so once more with Dark Assassin.Now a superintendent with the Thames River Police, Monk is on regular patrol near the Waterloo Bridge when he and his crew helplessly watch as a couple fall into the dark frigid waters. Did they think they had seen a struggle Was it a murder suicide or some grisly death pact?The pair were young and in love, planning to marry. The man was Toby Argyll and the girl Mary Havilland. She had recently lost her father who worked for the Argyll Company, a mega firm involved in the building of what was purported to be a splendid new sewer system. However, Mr. Havilland had serious doubts about the efficiency of the proposed system. He voiced these doubts too often, Mary believed, and was murdered for his claims.With Hester, his steadfast wife, by his side Monk begins to investigate the deaths of the young couple. There seems to be no question that there has been skullduggery at the Argyll Company, but who took the lives of Toby, Mary, and her father?Shades of Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle, Dark Assassin is a gripping listen as narrated by David Colacci who perfectly captures the voices of upper class Brits as well as the poor who labor beneath the city.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"It's true that this latest William Monk mystery novel is quite different from the previous ones in that instead of looking at one particular mystery plot from several different angles (one subplot that would've involved Monk's efforts, while another concentrated on Hester's and yet a third involved barrister Oliver Rathbone's contribution to the case), \\"Dark Assassin\\" is more of a \\"one-tone\\" mystery novel -- one sees things almost exclusively from Monk's point-of-view.William Monk has a new job as a police inspector with the Thames River Police. It is position that he has accepted because of the job security that it offers and because the inspector that he's replacing, the deceased Inspector Durban, had recommended him for the job (\\"The Shifting Tide\\"). Monk, however, is finding it heavy going trying to fill the popular Durban's shoes, especially since he feels the guilt of having survived while Durban died, and because he feels as if the other policeman of the Thames River Police not only hold him accountable for having survived, but also question his competence. One evening, while on patrol, Monk and his team witness the questionable plunge onto the Thames by a young couple. Both die from the impact. However it remains unclear as to whether or not it was a suicide pact between the two, if one of them was trying to push the other off the bridge and was pulled along by the struggle, or if one was trying to end his/her life and the other was pulled along. Monk soon discovers that the dead woman was Mary Havilland, that her own father had committed suicide a few months before -- something that quite devastated Mary -- and that the man who feel off the bridge with her was her ex-fiance, Toby Argyll. Moved by the tragic deaths and unsure as to what happened, Monk resolves to discover what really happened on the bridge and to prevent Mary from having the fate of being declared a suicide. Strangely enough, Monk receives help from an unexpected quarter -- from his old foe, Superintendent Runcorn, who had investigated Mary's father death, and who is having second thoughts about Havilland's death. Will Monk and Runcorn discover anything that will help them prove that Mary had not committed suicide out of despair? Or will all this cooperation be in vain?When I said that it was more of a \\"one-tone\\" mystery novel I meant that absent was the many tones and point-of-view that Anne Perry usually imbues her novels with, where the reader would be privy to how some of the characters viewed things (wrong-headed though they may be) and the pain and anguish that comes with the realisation as to where these views have led them or have wrought. \\"Dark Assassin\\" concentrated more on the subplot involving the investigation into the Havillands' activities (father and daughter) and Monk's new duties. And unfortunately, this time around Hester's contributions were confined mainly to her making a few social rounds as she tried to get the chief suspect's wife to testify against him. I rather missed the old Hester full of vim and vigour, ready to go out on a limb in order to help someone. On the other hand, this was a truly wonderfully absorbing read -- not very suspenseful one, it is true, but absolutely riveting nevertheless. And while I rather missed the skillful manner in which Ms Perry usually brought her multifaceted characters to life, the dark, urgent atmosphere of this novel -- those vividly rendered scenes in the nightmarish tunnels below the city where is everything is dank and damp for example-- more than made up for it. It is true that the pacing was slightly more sedate and a tad less breathless; but this was more because the novel moved between the Havilland case and Monk's other duties on the river than anything else. All in all though, \\"Dark Assassin\\" was an excellent read, and one that I enjoyed completely in spite of the fact that it was a little less compelling and darkly intriguing than previous installments. Only one thing truly confused me (and SPOILER ALERT here) I rather thought that during the Victorian period, if you were arrested on a criminal charge, you were remanded, which made the plot twist at the end a little problematical."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"The death of Inspector Durban in The Shifting Tide leads William Monk to replace Durban with the Thames River Police as a debt of honor and to provide some much-needed income. As the book opens, Monk is shivering in the bow of a police boat during January as the boat slowly approaches Waterloo Bridge. Less than two hundred feet away, Monk spots a man and woman facing one another with passion . . . just before something terrible happens.The unexpected event places Monk into an investigation that the Thames River Police would normally not pursue, much to the consternation of his new supervisor who is rightly concerned about a surge in river robberies. At the same time, Monk is having a hard time gaining control over his men and learning how to stop river crime.As Monk pursues his investigation, he finds lots of loose ends that leave him dissatisfied. That, in turn, leads him to an uneasy alliance with his former friend and adversary, Superintendent Runcorn.The loose ends all tie together into a trail that leads to the mad dash to create sewers to eliminate disease from London. Before the book ends, both Monk and Hester find themselves among the dank, dark underground rivers that crisscross London. You'll find as entertaining a crew of expert underground helpers as Charles Dickens ever produced for these adventures.I was tempted to grade this as a five-star book, but I couldn't quite bring myself to do that after remembering how slowly the book develops after the initial scene. Certainly, from about the half-way point to the end, this is a five-star effort full of interesting plots, subplots and villains that you'll long remember.I don't recall a book in this series that I've enjoyed more than the second half of Dark Assassin.The unique nature of river crime promises more exciting stories to come in this fine series."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"William Monk, now an inspector with the Thames River Police is on a routine patrol of the river when he watches helplessly as the bodies of a young man and woman fall from the Waterloo bridge. Even though Monk was an eyewitness, he has doubts about happened. Was the fall an accident, a deliberate push,or a struggle?It's always a pleasure to read about Monk and his wife Hester. They are compelling protagonists and fully fleshed-out characters who have grown with each subsequent story. Anne Perry's plots rarely disappoint, and this one is no exception, but her real gift is the atmosphere and the sense of time and place that she evokes."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Dark Assassin is the latest in Anne Perry's series of novels featuring William Monk and Hester Latterly, now his wife. In this story, Monk has taken a job with the River Police. One night while out on the river with his men, he and his crew witness the deaths of a man and a woman off a bridge over the Thames-- what they cannot decide, however, is if they witnessed a murder, a suicide or an accident. The case affects Monk deeply as he is reluctant to allow the deaths to be ruled suicide if there is a possibility that another verdict can be made so the young woman, particularly, can be buried in hallowed ground. He becomes especially suspicious when he finds that the young woman's father supposedly committed suicide a few weeks before. To ivestigate the two deaths, he teams up with Inspector Runcorn of the London Police, who had been Monk's partner in Monk's former life.Anne Perry excels at bringing Victorian England to life-- not just the romantic aspects, but the grittier reality of every day life. In this book she focuses on the building of the massive sewer tunnels beneath the city, and the life underground. Perry doesn't flinch at showing the seamier sides of life, and she takes great pains to constantly let us know how sheltered the middle class and above are from the living conditions of the people who labor to make their privileged lives possible.So how does Hester fit into this story? She plunges right into it, as she, also, is disturbed at the idea of the young woman being wrongfully buried in unhallowed ground. It brings back memories of the suicide of her own father, many years before. However, she approaches it from another angle, by going to see the MP who is responsible for the tunnels being built under the City of London and making the suggestion that there is a safety issue involved. The MP and his wife are both decent people and his wife, especially, readily agrees to assist Hester in finding out the truth about the young woman's death.The mystery in this book is not particularly extraordinary, and at the end it seems rather rushed-- which is a frequent problem in Anne Perry's books-- I like to have everything wrapped up in a neat little package with a bow on top, but I enjoy these books for the richness of the characters and the glimpse of a life that is very different from today's life, but in a lot of ways is still the same. It is a pleasure to see the return of young Scuff, and there is a hint that he may become a more regular character.All in all, this is an enjoyable book; it's not the kind of mystery that you can just read and forget. but like all of Perry's books, it is designed to make you think, and it gives you plenty to think about."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"I am a William Monk fan to the point that I like this series better than Perry's other two. Monk and Hester have a social conscience, a steadfast integrity, a deep committment to search for justice and truth no matter how difficult it may be. It is this that gives these books a depth that keeps the reader coming back for more.Monk has a new job as superintendent with the Thames River Police. He is still uncertain in his new job, and is not sure how his men will take to him. In this mystery, Monk is on regular patrol near the Waterloo Bridge when he and his crew helplessly watch as a couple fall into the dark frigid waters. The freezing water and heavy clothes insures that no rescue is possible. Was it a murder/suicide, an accident or a death pact?The two are identified as Toby Argyll and Mary Havilland, a young couple in love and planning to marry. Monk discovers that Mary's father is also dead, an apparent suicide. He worked for the Argyll Company, an important firm involved in the building of what is to be a splendid new London sewer system. Monk also discovers that Mr. Havilland had expressed serious doubts about the proposed system and he voiced these doubts. Mary did not believe her father committed suicide, she claimed he was murdered because of his vocal doubts about the sewer system.Monk and Hester investigate the deaths of the young couple and in an unual twist, Monk receives help from his old nemisis, Superintendent Runcorn. Runcorn investigated Mary's father's death and is having second thoughts about it being suicide.I gave \\"Dark Assassin\\" 4 stars instead of 5, because Perry does not have Hester as involved in this mystery as she has been in the past and her absence is noticeable. It also delves more on Monk's new duties and his uncertainties in his new job rather than on the subplots that are usual in his other novels. However, it is still an absorbing read and one which furthers our understanding of Victorian England society and Monk and Hester's place in it."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"As the icy waters of the Thames claimed the lives of two Londoners, Inspector William Monk could not be sure, as it played out before his horrified eyes, what he really saw. He watched helplessly from his River Police vessel as the bodies of a young man and woman tumbled from the bridge. No one knows better the unreliability of eyewitness accounts than a policeman. Now, Monk is confronting his own uncertainty. Could the couple have been arguing and lost their balance? Was the man trying to toss her over, or did he try to save her and she pulled him over with her? Even Monk's subordinates who watched along with him do not agree on the details.The police do know, however, that whatever happened, the new sewer construction seems to be at the center of it. The young woman's father worked deep in the tunnels for a company owned by her fiance's family. The word on the street is that the tunnels got to him, he couldn't take it any longer and he shot himself. But at the time of his demise, he was looking into the safety of the construction. A fortune stood to be made from the huge project, so if someone was making ripples, unscrupulous big business interests wouldn't hesitate to eliminate the \\"problem.\\" And the daughter took up the cause where her father left off. Did she find out something that her betrothed was attempting to hide? Maybe the same thing her father had found out?As the truth slowly comes to light through a great number of interviews --- both Monk's and Hester's, with a little help from their friends --- all three deaths start to smell fishy. And as for the sewers, well, the whitewashed reports of no serious injuries need to be reexamined, or the term \\"serious injuries\\" must be redefined. Tunnel work has never been rated among the safest occupations, so the optimistic lack of casualties smacks of a disturbing cover-up. Delving into the underground unearths a fiendish killer, and the deadly chase begins. If Monk doesn't watch every step, he may fall prey to the killer or, possibly worse, the tunnels themselves.Anne Perry has created an extraordinary pair of sleuths: Hester, Monk's headstrong wife, a nurse who can boast of having worked with Florence Nightingale, and Monk himself, a superb investigator and a man of quiet strength, surprised by his passion for a woman of such fierce opinions. Their interactions with the Victorian world of 1860s London show the extent of society's evolution over the past 150 years.Written convincingly in period prose and dialect, DARK ASSASSIN is a lively tale filled with action, compassion and, of course, mystery.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Ms. Perry exposes us to a whole new world in Victorian England in this latest installment of the William Monk series. In it we see the dark reaches under the streets in the teeming sewers and byways of Victorian London. We also are treated to a wonderfully tight-knit plot that is a page-turner until the end. Ms. Perry keeps the tension tight and the plot even tighter. I love the William Monk series, and this is a fine example of what this series has to offer. We also get to see some great characters that she introduced in her last book - Sutton and his wonderful little dog Snoot and Monk's little friend Scuff, who I'm sure we're going to see more of in other books.

But what did they see? Was it an accident that became a fatal accident? A murder and the killer dies with the victim? A suicide and the man dies trying to save the woman? The woman's death is proclaimed a suicide. Monk doesn't believe anyone who was working so hard to clear her father's reputation, after he also died of a supposed suicide, and provide he was right in believing the way in which the sewers were being built was dangerous would take their own life. Monk even joins forces with his old nemeses, Superintendent Runcorn.Ms. Perry continues to impress me with her writing. Her ability to take an historic event and build an interesting, suspenseful story around it is unsurpassed. She creates fascinating characters and makes them real; not only Monk and Hester, is wife, but Scuff, the street urchin who feels responsible for Monk, and Sutton the ratcatcher and his dog, Snoot. Each of the characters is brought to live and image under Ms. Perry's writing. I am always delighted to find the newest book by Ms. Perry."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Anne Perry keeps her Monk detective series fresh by moving him from private detection to superintendent of the Thames River Police. Her meticulously detailed depictions of the sewers of London, including those making their debased living from the sewage, and of the duties of the river police gives a new perspective on Victorian life that's new and rather creepy.A short synopsis: Monk is a witness to a couple who fall to their deaths from a bridge into the bitterly cold river while he is on river patrol. One of the victims, Miss Mary Havilland, was investigating the death of her father who was concerned that work on the new sewers by the Argyll company was progressing too rapidly, creating the imminent danger of a cave-in and endangering the large work crew in the tunnels. Her father's death was declared a suicide, but Monk's investigation of Mary's death leads him to believe her father was murdered.Now that Monk has come to terms with his past, he is a more likeable character, freer to express his feelings for his wife, Hester. The challenges of his new career have also humbled him a bit. I was irritated with Monk and Hester in the earlier novels as they had difficulty controlling their tempers and emotions. They have grown with the series, becoming more mature in their behavior. Runcorn has also matured: You see a new side to him in this novel.There is a surprise twist near the end, which is a feature of most Ms. Perry's novels. Sometimes, when you read several of an author's novels, you get a feel for who the villain will be or the issue involved. I didn't see this one coming.Also, one weakness of the earlier novels was the overt preachiness about the Crimean War: which was fine in a book or two, but it got old when you are a frequent reader. We all know that war is hell. She has toned this down quite a bit in the later novels, which has improved the series.There is no foul language or graphic sex in her novels, which makes these books a safe read for minors--and your grandmother!"},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Anne Perry hits the jackpot again with several plots in 1 story and manages to tie them all up in a neat bundle with intrigue and compassion."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Dark Assassin is another interesting William Monk and Hester Latterly mystery from Anne Perry, author of three historical mystery series.The Face of a Stranger (1990) was the first in this series.Perry's works all focus on various social problems of Victorian England. The intriguing plot twist in this series is that Monk has been injured in a carriage accident, and suffers from amnesia. He has rediscovered his identity but is not pleased with how he is perceived by his colleagues on the police force. Eventually he becomes a private investigator.In this book, Latterly and Monk are married, and Monk is working for the Thames River Police. One winter night he is in the patrol boat with his men, when they notice a couple arguing, or at least having an intense discussion, near the railing of the Waterloo bridge. Suddenly they both go over, locked in an embrace. The police are able to fish out the bodies, but the people died when they hit the water. They were Toby Argyll and his former fiance Mary Havilland. Was it an accident? A suicide? Murder?Monk begins to investigate this convoluted and complicated case. It is connected to the supposed suicide of Mary's father, James Havilland, months before, which Mary never accepted.James Havilland was an engineer working for the Argyll's (Toby and his brother Alan) sewer construction company, one of many working on the massive project. He was concerned about safety during the construction of the sewers because of the dangers flooding tunnels, gas and explosions. The sewers were needed desperately, due to the grim state of London's garbage system. All sewage drained into the Thames, which is where the drinking water came from as well--contributing to cholera epidemics in 1831, 1848 and 1854.The lives of the construction workers, however, were unbelievably horrible, and if they were injured and managed to survive, there was no welfare, no health system, nothing to help them.

It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it. Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache. Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion. And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.

I was glad to see more of Hester and William working together in this book, I had missed their interactions in the previous book. Perry's done a wonderful job of bringing in new secondary characters full of intrigue and interest. While on duty, Monk witnesses a man and woman plunge from a bridge together. Even Monk can't figure out if it was murder, suicide, or an accident. Investigating further brings him back into the realm of his long time adversary Runcorn and into the underground world of toshers and navvies. London is building is new sewer system that will leave the city forever changed. It's into this world of upheaval that Perry brings the reader with such care. Her ear for dialogue is unmatched and the details of this Victorian world are amazing. If you live in a large city, after reading this book, you won't take the ground under your feet for granted again! My two concerns for this book are the long list of secondary characters that are starting to overwhelm the plot. Scuff, Sutton, Runcorn, Rathbone: all are wonderfully intriguing, but there's only so much book and I fear for future entries. My other concern about this book didn't even occur to me until I started writing the review. The mystery is so cleverly crafted, the characters divine, the scenes thoroughly detailed, but the culprit and his motive seem weak, perhaps even unbelievable. The strength of this book and Perry's writing show that despite this, the book still shines. Don't start reading the Monk series with this book, start at the beginning.

The author's understanding of history in England in the Victorian era is fascinating. I feel as if I am right there in that particular time and place. Her descriptions of the characters are detailed enough to picture them in the mind's eye as if you saw actual pictures of them. I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good mystery."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"The William Monk series deals with England a decade or so after the Crimean War. The William Pitt series deals with the end of the Victorian era and the very start of the new century. The new Perry series deals with the Reavley family who not only deal with their parents' death, but are solidly involved in WWI. So Mrs. Perry is giving us a wealth of information on these times in history, and the social mores of those times.Regarding Dark Assassin, newly invented massive tunneling machines are being used in force to clean the horrid sewer situation of London. Several people who have questioned the safe use of these machines have died under questionable circumstances, and Monk, again a policeman, investigates - along with his wife, Hester Latterly, Rathbone, Runcorn, and other strong characters. They deal with the reality of the time and literally the underground existence of people who rarely see the light of day, as well as the society that was so strictly enforced in that time.Several satisfactory notes - the return of ratter Sutton and his terrier Snoot, and the street urchin, Scuff are notable - one hopes that they will be among the characters in the future Monk books -Again, this is a powerful book not only because of the story of Monk regaining his confidence professionally and personally, but the need for reform, and what difficulties stand in the way.As always, Perry is eloquent and you feel you are part of this story."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"I'm reviewing the audio version of this book.I'm sad to say, I didn't even finish listening to it, which is a bad sign in a murder mystery, when I don't even care that much who did it.

I am also posting my review of \\"The Sunless Sea\\"---my number nine.Anne Perry is a wonderful writer. I am amazed at her depth of knowledge, her large vocabulary, her writing ability and her prolific writing history. Her books are always worthwhile and a good read.(Here comes the however) however, as I grow older and see more of the dark and sinister things of our world, the less I enjoy reading about them even if it is in Victorian times. This book was too \\"dark\\" for me. While I enjoyed most of the details of the story above the ground, the descriptions of the vast, filthy, rat-filled, pitch dark, damp, and dangerous underground sewer tunnels where people live, grub, struggle, are maimed, and die, is not enjoyable to me.At this time, William Monk is a newly-appointed Thames River senior officer policeman. While patrolling on the river with his crew, he witnesses a young couple on the Waterloo Bridge who appear to be arguing when they fall into the water and drown. They are quickly found and identified as Mary Havilland and Toby Argyll.As Monk tries to determine whether it was a suicide or an accident he learns that Mary's father was thought to have committed suicide just two months earlier and that Toby Argyll is her ex-fianc&eacute;.

The mystery unfolds as Monk and his old adversary, Superintendent Runcorn, work together to discover what actually happened to Mary's father and why, and what the Argyll's had to do with it.As always, the courtroom scenes with Oliver Rathborn are brilliant. Ms. Perry knows how to develop the dialog and descriptions of non-verbal facial and bodily movements skillfully--making you feel as if you are actually there; (another however), I have learned after eight Monk books that Perry's endings are often a let down. Like other authors, they seem to have become somewhat the same--fade away into ______? (you fill in the blank).Nevertheless, I will give this book five stars because all of Perry's books are good.

He's got his work cut out for him, because he's replacing a recently deceased officer who was greatly esteemed by his men. On a routine patrol, Monk observes a couple take a horrific plunge off Waterloo bridge. Was it intentional or accidental? This question takes on deeper meaning when Monk learns that the young woman's father died, an apparent suicide, only a few months earlier. Because she reminds him of his beloved Hester, Monk can't put the incident out of his mind, and is drawn deeper and deeper into a case of industrial sabotage.Few writers since Dickens, with whom Anne Perry is frequently compared, can capture the aura of Victorian London as she does. Perry's plots take her readers all over the city, from its seediest neighborhoods to its river to its hidden underground. She seamlessly weaves social and moral issues into her stories. She also sees to it, unlike most series writers, that her characters do not stagnate. In Dark Assassin, Monk is forced to confront the mutual dislike between him and former boss Runcorn, in order to achieve what has become a mutual goal. A new relationship with an appealing, homeless street urchin develops. And the brilliant but introverted Monk must learn, at last, to become a leader of men.That's good writing."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Several years after being kicked off the Metropolitan Police Force (which was at least partly his own fault), William Monk, erstwhile \\"private enquiry agent\\" in 1863 London, is finally back in uniform -- though he's not entirely happy about it. Having gotten involved with crime on the Thames in the last volume, he's now an Inspector in the River Police (and the Met's longtime rivals). After her encounter with the plague at her charity clinic, his wife, Hester, an ex-Crimean nurse, has been ordered to stay at home -- at least temporarily. Not that she can help involving herself in whatever injustices come to her notice, however. Monk has witnessed a young couple topple off Westminster Bridge (accident? suicide? murder?) and his investigation leads him into reopening an earlier case of suicide, which was one of Superintendent Runcorn's cases. (Monk and Runcorn had been friends and close colleagues, then rivals, then enemies, and are now moving slowly back into an uneasy accommodation.) The plot focuses on the urgent need to replace London's totally inadequate sewer system, occasioned both by the Great Stink of 1858 and by the recent series of typhoid and cholera outbreaks. Of course, there's lots of money to be made in such a mammoth (and competitive) public works project, and that can lead to sloppy attention to safety regulations and even murder. All of which is well and good (and the details are pretty interesting), but Perry repeats her old problem of letting the narrative get away from her. The plotline is confusing, salient points are repeated numerous times (just in case the reader wasn't paying attention, I guess), and she has a tendency to make casual reference to earlier events or bits of business that have, apparently, been edited out of the text. On the other hand, she's been bringing in a whole new group of supporting players lately, both among Monk's subordinates in his new job and among his other acquaintances on the river, and on the staff of Hester's clinic. I wish she'd bring back Sgt. Evan, though; he doesn't deserve to be so cavalierly dumped."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Monk's difficult financial situation, created by Lady Callendra's departure for Vienna and Hester's clinic needing her constant involvement, pushes him to find employment in area of London that is outside his usual purview, The Thames. Taking a case involving stolen cargo puts Monk outside his comfort zone and it shows. He becomes dependent on the help of a young wharf rat to make his way in this new territory and through this connection you see another facet of Monk's awakening humanity revealed. Hester finds herself facing a situation so volatile that all of London is imperiled, and the pain both she and Monk suffer while trying to cope with these entwined dilemmas threatens to overwhelm them and all in their community of friends. Perry does a great job with this one as the emotional strength of the story doesn't overwhelm the mystery; it enhances it, causing the tension to be palpable. This is a fine addition to this long running series and Perry's move to upset the status quo of her amnesiac detective is welcome."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Anne Perry's beautiful prose and her excellent scope of social values in Victorian England is top notch.

You really feel as if you are in Victorian England."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Anne Perry has this time period down pat. She keeps you aware of how injustice can prevail if you turn a blind eye to what is going on around you."},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"William Monk, former Metropolitan Police detective and former private investigator who now supervises the Thames River Police, is on patrol with his men when a young woman and a young man tumble off a bridge and die swiftly in the cold January water. Exactly what happened? Did the man try to stop the woman from committing suicide, or did the woman pull the man off with her? The woman has to be buried in unhallowed ground when her death is ruled a suicide, but Monk isn't a bit certain. So Monk investigates. He soon learns that the young woman's father also committed suicide, according to an investigation into his death by Monk's former Metropolitan Police supervisor. The families of both the woman and the man, her one-time fiance, are deeply involved in the massive on-going construction project that will replace London's ancient, haphazard, and utterly inadequate sewers with a modern system - something everyone agrees desperately needs to be done. But is the project being pushed too fast, and is it therefore creating serious and needless danger? What if the great digging machines breach an underground river, or set off a methane-fueled fire that could find its way into the gas lines feeding the homes of London's better-off citizens?As always with a Monk novel, author Perry writes a book that's as much character study as mystery. It is also, again as usual, a meticulously detailed historical novel of London in Victorian times. As Monk and his wife, former Crimean nurse Hester who now runs a rescue mission for prostitutes, investigate this particular crime, they must delve deep into the worst poverty and most appalling living conditions of that era. What struck me as I read was the innate dignity and worth Perry gives the people living under those conditions, as I saw them through the eyes of her two protagonists. An affecting tale as well as a page turner, with twists and turns that lasted to the very end.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"Anne Perry chooses one theme to explore in the books I read by her; Dark Assassin, shows the life of the workers in the bed of the Thames, all the various tasks done by poor children and poor men in the way of earning one's living. the novel being an entertaining detective story , she gives pace and speed elegantly to the plot of a realistic novel dealing with the building of the new sewers in London in Victorian times. Both genres mix quite well and result in a well written book quite pleasant to read"},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","review":"I love learning about new facets of the Victorian era that haven't gotten much coverage in literature.

When out on patrol one bone chilling winter dusk, Monk and Sergeant Orme witness a young woman and man seemingly arguing on a lonely Waterloo Bridge. They struggle and then fall into the river, killed almost instantly. The police only have a distant view in poor light from a bad angle. Did the woman jump and the man try to rescue her? Did he push her, and get dragged in himself? Or were they struggling, and fell in by accident? The story that ensues is refreshingly tight and focused, harking back to the tone of Perry's early Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels.Two points of plot do bother me. First, why are so many -- the police, the church authorities who must decide whether to bury her in consecrated ground, even the families -- so eager to assume Mary committed suicide? Usually, it seems that in cases where the evidence is ambiguous (and that certainly is the case here) a verdict of accidental death is assumed out of charity if nothing else. Second, why does no one ever simply go up on the bridge to check out the scene of the incident? Maybe there were witnesses they couldn't see from below, maybe one of them dropped something (the incriminating letter, say, \\"Darling, meet me on the bridge to finalize our assassination plot\\"), a trip wire, who knows -- but it would seem the most basic of police work to at least look, immediately or at least when questions arise.Nonetheless, this is a good read, quintessential Perry, and recommended."},{"Title":"Golden Retrievers For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I've not had a dog since I was a child so I need ALL the help I can get.

There is not a stone left unturned (or toy left unchewed)in the book. The author knows her dogs and covers every aspect of puppyhood and EXACTLY what to expect. If you read this book and follow it's advice, I don't know how you wouldn't end up having a great dog, instead of just a &quot;good&quot; dog. She puts the responsibility squarely on the owner and that you can't just have a casual relationship with your dog. You have to make a commitment to the dog. I have recently adopted an older Golden (thus the reason I bought the book)and while I would love to enjoy a puppy and train it through the years, I also realize it could take more time than I have to give at this moment, so I am extra glad I read the book. As I said, it should be required reading BEFORE anyone considers getting a dog.

Even these adorable little dogs need strict training and discipline so they can rise to their best behavioral level. You'll learn all the things you SHOULD do to train your dog and many that you shouldn't like rubbing its nose in feces (who ever thought of that!). Obviously, some dog owners must be a bit daft.

The subject matter of the book revolves around font metrics and system programming which is an interesting platform to exercise your MFC muscle throughout this book. Unlike most MFC books there is no reliance on the MFC AppWizards that make the UNIX world laugh at the point and click Windows world. The code is generously saturated with useful comments to make out what the writer is logistically trying to achieve with his code. The diagrams in the book are very clear and easy to understand. This book in my opinion is probably the best overall MFC book. It has subject matter explained that Prosise does not dare to explain, or material that is usually undocumented. The book is not a War and Piece tome, but a little over 600 pages or so is not that bad. The ideal book for a novice who wants to solidify his MFC skills and level his knowledge at expert level.

The bulk of this book covers: printing, system metrics, fonts, bitmaps, complex document/views, enhanced metafiles, and internet programming.In some places, it gets bogged down by explaining what every function or attribute does, but that is for the benefit of the reader.

After some further civilized speechifying, the gentleman revealed that he served in the Emperor's air force, and would like to honor the family by inducting the youth in that organization. \\" 'Ah so', remarked my father, with carefully manufactured surprise'\\".This book tells an extraordinarily convincing story of Kuwahara's experiences in boot camp and as a pilot who watched many of his friends die in the final assaults on Allied forces in the Pacific. Moreover, it contains an early description of the hellish scene after the American atomic attack on Hiroshima, where Kuwahara was spending some leave time when the bomb was dropped.Readers will find that there was indeed dissent against Tokyo's war inside Japan, and in fact within the military.

His psychoanalytic theories of sexuality, sublimation, repression, etc., offer original insights that profoundly influenced the course of Western consciousness in the 20th century. In addition to his gifts as a thinker, Freud was a master stylist, a man whose luminous prose and skillful argumentation make reading him a genuine pleasure.\\"Civilization and Its Discontents,\\" one of Freud's last works, remains one of his most vital and important. Don't be fooled by its brevity; this is a deeply complex and wide-ranging examination of Western civilization and its tensions. Freud speculates about the origins of our modern societies, the difficulties of assimilating ourselves to them given our own individual psyches, and ends the book with a rather pessimistic look forward. Clearly, Freud felt that civilization's \\"discontents\\" were an unresolvable fact of life.What makes \\"Civilization and Its Discontents\\" so fascinating is Freud's application of psychoanalysis to Western society as whole. He examines how the factors at play in our own psyches--family conflicts, sexual desire, guilt, the \\"death instinct,\\" and the eternal battle between our own self-interest and the interests of the human species at large--cause the problems that human beings encounter on a daily basis. As always with Freud, his ideas are put forward not as a final statement, but as a tentative first step.This is one of Freud's indispensable texts, and its accessible and absorbing style make it an ideal introduction for those who are seeking to discover this colossal mind for the first time. A must read."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"I have to admit to being a little prejudiced before starting this book. I had read a lot of negative criticism of Freud, so finally I decided to read something for myself and find out what all the fuss is about. A person who creates such polar views must be saying something that touches the core. This slim book is a good place to start.Freud clearly had a deep understanding of the human condition. When you consider he was a born in the 1800s, it is clear he was many years ahead of his time. This book discusses how the individual is inevitably subjugated by his society to become civilized. That is how the social order represses our desires. He discusses both the positive and negative aspects of this on personal development. I found it quite a difficult read as there are extensive footnotes throughout the book that are sometimes pertinent and at other times not, which I found disrupted the chain of reasoning at times.A worthy read that has encouraged me to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"Many people today believe that Sigmund Freud was obsessed with sex. However, most of these assumptions are based upon what another person said of Freud and almost never upon a careful reading of Freud's work. These people do not see the fact that Freud writes on more than sexuality, he also analyzes and researches the study of mankind. Sigmund Freud attacks the question why we do things the way we do head on and answers to the best of his reason. Therefore, Sigmund Freud was truly a man of his time and his debate on mankind was a very innovative method to answer mankind's most serious issues.Man is an aggressive being and civilization is the means which humanity withholds its primal urges in check. At least Freud believes so and shows support for this thesis by referring to mankind's constant need to restrain its inherent passions despite all of the controls placed by society. I believe that Freud was definitely on to something with this point. He is right when he states that man is essentially an anti-social, anti-cultural being. One could look down through the pages of history and see war after war, violent act after violent primarily as a result of the inherent greed for power and a passionate thirst for more than one's own. This is one of the many reasons why communism is impossible, man is a selfish being and always desires more than he possesses. He will do what is necessary to increase his holding at the expense of his fellows. I believe that Nietzsche and Freud are in agreement at this point. However, Nietzsche believes that the masses attempt to quell this passion and label that as noble. I believe that Freud does not think it is possible to restrain this aggressiveness and mankind is only able to cover it up in a semblance of control which we label civilization. Though I see merit in both men's argument, my reaction is that there is another solution. I believe in Christian perspective that \\"by beholding we become changed\\" and with a personal relationship with Christ one is capable of achieving victory over that aggression. Freud argues that the need for self-preservation is often disrupted by a \\"social anxiety\\". This anxiety is a state in which individuals are controlled by the opinions of others towards them. Freud contends that the majority of society is ruled by this anxiety. His solution to this is a \\"higher stage\\" attainable by rising above the need to care about how others perceive one's conduct. This implies that behavior controlled by social conventions is more primitive than behavior controlled by the individual. According to Freud, morality is not an issue of socially determined shame, but a matter of internalized primal guilt. This guilt is the basis for beliefs such as an original sin and is the main catalyst in mankind's aggression. I doubt that this is the most flattering perspective to look upon our own nature, but Freud's argument does contain a lot of merit.We read earlier in Walden that \\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation\\" and I believe Freud saw this desperation as a direct result of the affects of social anxiety. We see this today in the pop culture where in order to fit in an individual must conform to the trends in fashion. We see it in the work environment where the worker flatters his boss. We see it in the political world where politicians say and do what is necessary to keep public opinions high. We are so drawn into the belief that the opinions of others matters that we spend the majority of our time and money on things we don't need to impress people we don't care about.After reading Civilization and Its Discontents I am not under the impression that Freud is correct about everything. However, I am able to respect his writing as an important critical look at society which still has merit even today. Perhaps our world would be a better place if all of its inhabitants stop to think of why they do the things they do and what are the effects of their actions. Perhaps mankind would improve if we learned how to control our inherent aggression and to not worry about other people's opinions. Perhaps this is merely wishful thinking on my part."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"To whoever is interested in Freuds &quot;Civilization and It's Discontents&quot; I SAY READ IT!

But this does not dispose of the technique of living based on the value of love as a means to happiness.\\"\\"(P)ower over nature is not the ONLY precondition of human happiness, just as it is not the ONLY goal of cultural endeavor; we ought not to infer from it that technical progress is without value for the economics of our happiness.\\"\\"Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God.

Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desure for aggression by weakening and disarming it and by setting up an agency within him to watch over it...\\"\\"If civilization is a necessary course of development from the family to humanity as a whole, then ... there is inextricably bound up with it an increase of the sense of guilt, which will perhaps reach heights that the individual finds hard to tolerate.\\""},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"If you can find another translation of this seminal book (see my review of Freud's Gravida), then do so.

What do they do to our eros, our capacity for loving and feeling solidarity? And how do they stimulate our frustration and aggression?While I disagree with Freud's conclusion that the total psychic repression of powerful passions is a necessary evil for the existence of culture, I do think he challenges us to wonder about just how high a price we pay for what we believe to be the &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;nobler&quot; achievements of the mind."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"I purchased this book as an introduction for myself to Freud's philosophies and I was very glad that I made the purchase.

Within this short book he had taken my whole view of the world, turned it upside-down, and added an exclamation point. To understand this book doesn't require great intellectual power but rather mental capacity i.e, a capacity to receive a massive dose of pessimism!

This book is exemplifies the irrational foundation of psychoanalysis above all others. Poorly reasoned arguments and absolutely fantastic assertions fill this rather rambling volume from cover to cover. Another rather disturbing aspect to this book is it's reliance on Lamarckian evolutionary theory which was completely discredited long before Freud began his writing. Freud certainly knew about this, so is he being deceitful?However, Freud's prose is something to be admired. I suspect his writing ability (and the bizarre but energetic cult of personality that surrounded Freud during his life) was the main reason for the success of the psychoanalysis movement. It certainly wasn't the arguments for they simply lack intellectual merit.Once you peer behind the psuedo-scientific veneer of his theories, you cannot help but to feel Freud was yet another nihilistic hedonist attempting, not only to rationalize his degeneracy, but also foist his error onto a civilization that he found so dispicable. If you read this book with a sharp analytical mind, it will go a long way in helping to destroy the cult of psychology's greatest fraud.

A few ancient Greeks thought mania could be great, and many times I have felt that a person really shouldn't have to be crazy, but it takes a wacky guy to say anything. Freud would have a hard time justifying his existence as a doctor if doctors didn't have a long history of convincing people that they were crazy. Religious fanatics have been able to practice their frenzies when it could be done as a form of harmless exhibitionism, but the idea that human beings exist primarily as components of a society makes the ability to decide which element is ultimately the most catastrophic a serious question, and how seriously Freud treats this stuff is indicated by how Heine's great joke on a topic which Freud considers a forbidden form of humor makes it into a footnote, anyway. Maybe Heine was dead by the time Freud wrote this book, so Freud thought it wouldn't really hurt if we all had a laugh at Heine's expense, but some people might not think it was as funny if Freud had been talking about Osama bin Laden.

For example, Jared Diamond's massive tome \\"Collapse.\\" It is therefore timely to see what an influential thinker like Freud said on the subject of civilization. Freud thought that mankind was over-sexed and innately aggressive. He favored civilization as the way to curb these instinctual drives. The sublimated energy can be channeled into the creation of (high) culture and scientific \\"progress.\\" Freud does admit that the repression of instincts is a problem of civilization, but it is the price we have to pay for order, culture and \\"progress.\\" Further, he advocated psychoanalysis in order to manipulate people so they would accept the discontents of civilization. But Freud bases his defence of civilization on false premises. There is nothing wrong with healthy outlets for the sex drive. Culture can be created without sublimation. Repression causes more problems than it is worth. Man is not innately aggressive.This is a fallacy propounded by the patriarchy to justify its aggression and repression. On the last page Freud questions his own assumptions about man's aggression. He states that man's power over nature gives him the ability to destroy himself. We can't avoid the fact that that civilizations promote devasting weapons and wars. By exploding Freud's ingenuous arguments we can see civilization as a tool of patriachy for dominance and repression. Civilizations collapse because they are inherently corrupt.

If this is the only one of Freud's books you read, you may wonder why his ideas draw so much attention. Especially if you have read the Pantanjali Yoga Sutras, which, both systematically and lucidly, address human suffering, etc.,as well as providing clear guidance for coping with this suffering. While this offering of Freud can be a quick, at times engaging and charming read, I was too often thoroughly annoyed by a 'shallowness', or worse, actual deceitfulness, in stating positions he must have known had already been exposed as untenable. Like me, you may have trouble getting past his penchant for presenting the weakest opposing argument and gently, sweetly, knocking it over in favor of his musings thinly disguised as 'fact'. And, if you've been around the block a few times, (college, grad school, law school, Hotel Earth resident for half a decade), you may find yourself astonished by his seeming lack of awareness, and/or reminded of the endless debate over the number of teeth in a horse's mouth, without simply counting them. Fortunately, the Yoga Sutras (thousands of years old) provide excellent guidance in answering for yourself the myriad questions raised by Freud.ps if you have no deep-rooted issues with skipping ahead (or walking out of a movie that's going no where, and slowly at that), read the last 3 to 5 pages first, to get a sense of where he's headed."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"There isn't much I can add to previous reviews of Civilziation and Its Discontents.

Many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--Rousseau, for example.

He also wrote it when he was on the verge of his own personal going down into darkness. So the Destructive and Death- bringing aspect of human character and human civilization are very much on his mind when he writes this work. And he writes in a work in which he sees the forces of death and destruction as inside the gates from birth. Like original Sin for the Christian the power of Thanatos threatens to take the soul down forever. It threatens to make all of human life a hell of constant, ongoing conflict. To this the Mind and Eros its more positive side respond with a power of sublimation, a capacity to transform those evil instincts into constructive building powers, and this as in Judaism the ' yetzer hara' evil urge is ideally transformed into constructive action of the 'yetzer hatov' As I understand it and I do not understand it fully I admit for Freud the dark powers cannot be fully contained or sublimated but always exist at the threshhold of consciousness and History, waiting to manifest themselves again in terrible violence.Who would have believed that little more than half a century after the Allied Forces led by the United States vanquished an enemy which threatened to turn Mankind as a whole into a totalitarian concentration camp, there would emerge a new threat from a different part of the world ( Islamic fundamentalism) in which the darkest powers within us again threaten to make all the light of civilization into an unending desert night?Freud saw something true about the human condition, and this is the perpetual recurrence of Evil. And its perpetual transformation into new forms which may threaten us again and again.Can we contend ? can the other positive forces prevail ?Let us pray so lest we go into a night of nights, in which no books will be read and reviewed on Amazon, no freedom of the individual will be allowed, and all of us will be subject to a narrow dictatorial agressive dominating force which represents the worst in us at this historical moment."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"For all the celebrated shortcomings of his theories, Sigmund Freud remains, even in retrospect, the most influential thinker of the 20th century, a giant among the giants of that now by-gone era of late modernity. He still must be regarded as the most perspicuous among positivistic and systematic students of human nature and the most devoted, at least in the consistency of his ideas. His rubric for the self-referential category, \\"ego\\", is used almost universally, regardless of culture, language, or learning. Who among us hasn't used the term? Very few thinkers in any age can claim such rapid and profound widespread assimilation of their ideas as Freud. He was also first among the moderns, really the first since Montaigne, to formally prioritize self-knowledge among all types of knowledge, and, reverting to a very ancient idea, perceive the telos or fruit of the attainment of knowledge as therapeutic. While James and other contemporaries focused on elaborating the principles of the new science of human nature, founded on behavioral rather than traditionally metaphysical grounds, Freud undertook the project of their application, in a simple and accessible manner on as broad a scale as possible. Nowhere in his oeuvre is this delineation of the explanatory power of the application of psychological theory to central social problems or queries more transparent than in Civilization and Its Discontents.Surprising to many coming to Freud for the first time, is that his writing, for the most part, exhibits such clarity that it can be read and understood, within the limits of their comprehension, by children. I remember reading a bit of The Interpretation of Dreams at age fourteen and getting something out of it. But more than accessibility accounts for the impact of Freud's ideas. If a science of human nature is in its infancy, in his nascent structuralist model, Freud gave it a language if not a new paradigm that could be universally acquired. But personally, exclusive of Totem and Taboo, I find his later works, The Future of An Illusion, Civilization and Its Discontents, and the vastly underrated, Moses and Monotheism, to be far more interesting and relevant than the better known early works where he develops his psychological theories.The quintessential late modern (an era that begins philosophically with publication of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and the incendiary works of Tom Paine), Freud appears to write The Future of An Illusion as a defense, an apologia, if you will, of his atheism. He begins by designating Civilization and Its Discontents an extension of this argument. He cannot be merely, tritely arguing didactically for atheism. What he is saying in the preliminary stage of the argument amounts to this: Up to now, traditional religion has been our primary lense for viewing human, thus social, action. But what if, and one must grant at least the possibility, God, Christ, et al, is a mass delusion or rationalization? Could not a science of human nature, a systematic inward scrutiny, provide a more productive perspective on our problems? Is not the human project something other than, even more than, a divinely ordained, fatalistically fulfilled apocalyptic end? And, looking at the human condition (he writes in 1930), there is no denying a new way looking is desperately needed, for perhaps our very survival.The next claim in the argument is that all societies promise justice. Yet, as individuals, we inevitably protest the \\"civilizing\\" process a society takes to deliver some degree of justice to its members. Freud claims that this process necessarily does violence to the individual. The individual is bound by civilization to his/her fellows and, in this process, the natural desires are limited, restricted, and bent by the whim of an external, collective will, \\" . . . which aims at binding the members of a community together in a libidinal way as well and employs every means to that end.\\" We are naturally resentful. We want it all. Especially sex, with whomever we deign to mount or be mounted by. But Freud buys further into psychological egoism: \\" . . . men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness.\\" \\"Man's natural aggressive instinct, the hostility of each against all and of all against each, opposes this programme of civilization . . . whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind.\\"Hobbesian as a social theorist, he's absolutely Nietzschean when he debunks the Socratic \\"Archimedian Point of Good\\" and Agape or Christian Altruism as ideals of civilization which can never be happily achieved, sources of frustration, guilt, despair, and worse yet. \\"We may reject the existence of an original, as it were natural, capacity to distinguish good from bad. What is bad is often not at all what is injurious or dangerous to the ego; on the contrary, it may be something desirable and enjoyable to the ego. Here, therefore, is an extraneous influence at work, and it is this that decides what is to be called good or bad.\\" The \\"civilizing programme\\" thus sets itself up as a sentinel within the individual psyche, in opposition to the natural tendencies to self-gratification. [Then] \\" . . . the sense of guilt is clearly only a fear of loss of love, \`social' anxiety.\\" \\"Civilization has to use its utmost efforts in order to set limits to man's aggressive instincts and to hold the manifestations of them in check by psychical reaction-formations. Hence, therefore, the use of methods intended to incite people into identifications and aim-inhibited relationships of love, hence the restriction upon sexual life, and hence too the ideal's commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself - a commandment which is really justified by the fact that nothing else runs so strongly counter to the original nature of man.\\"Abiding by the Amazon rules, I won't be a spoiler. What I wish to point to is how Freud acted as a conduit for some of the most influential and disturbing modes of thought, general acceptance of which the popularity of the \`psychological' approach he spearheaded encouraged. A few of his conclusions thus call for review. \\" . . . may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization - possibly the whole of mankind - have become \`neurotic'.\\" \\"The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their extent their cultural development will succeed is mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction.\\" The continuing influence of these pioneering insights renders Civilization and It's Discontents a must read for any who wish to come to grips with structures of thought which have crucially contributed to current malestorm."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"Good stuff.

The perennial problem with Freud is that a lot of what he says cannot be proved scientifically. The most important things in life like love and God aren't scientific but they (usually) never claimed to be, unlike Freudian theory. As someone who knows a bit of history and politics, I find Freud's analysis of civilization to be more about what his own inner urges projected upon the world than what is actually out there. His treatment of the sexual instinct as being something tamed and frustrated by civilization may be true for him and others but is probably not true generally. There are males who really don't want unlimited sex with everything. The problem is that Freud over-generalizes his own experience and ancedotal evidence into a universally applicable theory.His treatment of religion is particularly superficial and reductionistic. In essence, he elavates the irrationality of the id in man to the point where if one took him seriously, one would doubt both Freud's supposed rationality and his or her own. The great error is modern psychology is that people can be known fully the same way chemicals or animals could be known. The truth is that people cannot be known this way. One has to geto to know them. They are not generalized objects but unique subjects."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"I received my order on time and it was in good shape as expected.

However he is also a mythic interpreter whose visions do not readily subject themselves to scientific confirmation, or disproof. For this reason Karl Popper believed them to be outside the realm of ' scientific' respectability.Freud's idea of civilization coming as a form of sublimation of our aggression, has I think limited explanatory and zero predictory power. He wrote the work when the world was on the edge of darkness, and all Civilization threatened.What would seem to confirm a certain part of his vision is the coming into being once again ,more than half- a - century from he fall of the Nazis he feared- and little more than a decade since the fall of the Evil Empire the Soviet Union- a new threat to Mankind. Again the dark forces of totalitarian thought threaten Mankind. Only this time it comes from the very realm a certain reading of Freud might have expected to be diminishing. It is out of the realm of Freud's illusion, religion , that comes this new totalitarian terrorist Islam.So there seems to be something for the idea of a persistence even more than recurrence of Thanatos, the drive for Evil and destruction. The Freudian myth of two conflicting powers a destructive and constructive one seems again confirmed.Whether our Civilization will be able to overcome this time as it has in the past is a real question. But it cannot be answered by Freud."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"This was a very short, yet very fun read. Freud proposes some pretty far fetched and strange concepts, yet I can see some appeal in them. I didn't agree with a lot of what he said, but I enjoyed this book greatly and it did have some good points."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"Utopian and dysutopian thought pervade modern culture. Freud here wrote a book that attempted to bisect the horns of this dilemma by preserving a commitment to the Enlightenment while rejecting both horns. A fundamental text of the modern age. One can not consider oneself educated if one has not read this book."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"Along with a bunch of series of books about suffering, and misery, and pain... I had to read Civilization and Its Discontents. Basically Mr. Freud rants on, and on, and on, about topics. To get into it is quite hard, but once you understand his way of writing, you become more comfortable with his never-ending sentences. He says that in exchanged for living in civilization, we trade in happiness for guilt. And it is true."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"With his culture theoretical documents Freud had essentially share at the development of the philosophical self-determination of mankind. After the Christian conception of the world had shattered, and human beings lost their feeling of being in security, after philosophers like Kierkegaard told, that only the fight for a pure individuality (and no common religious feelings) would be a help in the future, after Immanuel Kant had recognized the one-sidedness nature of academic scientifical points of view - a Nietzsche became famous, hammering out, that the power of will and lust (like Dionysos) should be focused - since the contrary, the Apollonian world of law and order had surpressed too much of important emotional horizons. Freud delivered more details of this conflict between sex and aggression and - on the other hand - sublimation, the capability to listen to the routes of correctness: a \\"super-ego\\" (like an inner police, living in every human being) is fighting against an ego, wishing childishly to love or to fight, often in the wrong moment and at the very wrong place. While an Arthur Schopenhauer still constituted the will as driving force of the world, but assigned only a role of an onlooker to the intellect, Freud drilled in greater detail: The destruction strength of human beings, their desire to meet death, their lust of aggression is the core of all driving inner-forces (Freud's opinion). This driving energy arduously sublimes in good behaviour, but then often dumps in self aggression or in an outside aggression. It is Freud's contribution to have made us examine an anthropological basic constant: the perpetually endangering human aggression instinct. Freud is therefore completely congruent with Schopenhauer, concerning the pessimistic prevailing mood. So he does not share the naivet&eacute; and enthusiasm of the at that time current \\"life philosophy\\" or the optimism of the existentialism starting with Henri Bergson's \\"elan vital\\": It is not very astonishing: Sigmund Freud was powerlessly hemmed in between two World Wars. He suffered (emigrating to London) under the Nazi-oppression. Long before any Islamic fundamentalism ruled the daily news, he clearly analyzed how much efforts we need, to calm down the global attacks of a so-called \\"death instinct\\". Therefore his culture theoretical documents perhaps are still much more meaningfully than the gloomy approaching area of his sick individual person stories..."},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","review":"While I agree that Civilization and Its Discontents has some kernels of truth within it, I cannot recommend it either as a persuasive piece or as an introduction to Freudian thought. I do not know if, in his longer works, Freud actually supports any of his statements with more than the weak ancedotal proofs he gives here; nor do I know if he actually works through his arguments to a logical conclusion instead of relying on sensationalistic statements with no basis in his evidence. Suffice to say he does not meet the minimum requirements, in my opinion, for philosophical or scientific excellence, in this book. Furthermore, the rambling, vague, and disorganized nature of this book makes its usefulness as a mere introduction to Freud extremely weak. I would only suggest using it as a companion to such other works as Five Lectures on Psychoanalysis, or as an immediate overview and introduction to The Future of an Illusion (which, though written earlier than Civilization, more fully elucidates many of the principles Freud touts here). As a long-time student of classical thought, philosophy, and ethics, not to mention the fundamental principles of logic, I found myself highly unimpressed with this work, and saw no great haven of Truth within it. Further, having been raised by Secular Humanists, I am less than convinced of the practical merits of Freud's ideas.

The Haiti stories are unrelentingly depressing, while the New York stories are uplifting.

The daughter rejects the fascistic terms of the state and the state of fear and emasculation Papa has been forced to live in.

Krak!","review":"Touching stories that paint a vivid picture. Every word has a role in these moving stories that depict the lives of strong women in or from Haiti. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be embraced by culture and to brave the sorrow."},{"Title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"The first thing that came to my mind while reading Edwidge Danticat's collection Krik? Krak! is that it is pure poetry. The first lines in &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;, the first short story in the collection, are &quot;They say behind the mountains are more mountains. Now I know it's true. I also know there are timeless waters, endless seas, and lots of people in this world whose names don't matter to anyone but themselves.&quot; The lyrical poetic style is consistent throughout all of Danticat's prose, which makes Krik? Krak! an easy and beautiful book to read despite the heavy issues addressed in each story within it. In Haiti a story-teller will say &quot;Krik?&quot; and anyone wishing to hear the story answers, &quot;Krak!&quot; and this is the basis for many of the stories Danticat writes.And many important themes are dealt with in these deceptively simple stories. Most of them encompass three main issues: Poverty and hard times in Haiti, mother and daughter relationships and the self-awareness brought to each because of them, and the transition of immigrants. In Haiti a story-teller will say &quot;Krik?&quot; and anyone wishing to hear the story answers, &quot;Krak!&quot; and this is the basis for many of the stories Danticat writes. Although each story can be easily summarized, the underlying theme and unexpected conclusions reveal much more about life, especially a life of poverty and despair.In &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;, a young man on a ship from Haiti to the US writes letters to his girlfriend and Haiti and she writes letters to him, although they cannot send them to each other. In &quot;Nineteen Thirty-Seven&quot;, a girl visits her mother, who is in prison for being accused of witch-craft. &quot;A Wall of Fire Rising&quot; is in interesting perception of poverty, in which a mother and afather trying to raise their young boy in a happy environment face insurmountable pressures. The central character in &quot;Night Women&quot; is a mother who works as a prostitute in order to support her son while in &quot;Between the Pool and the Gardenias&quot; it is a young sterile woman who greatly desires a child even among the poverty and distress so many young children face in Haiti. A young motherless girl befriends an American journalist during the war in Haiti in &quot;The Missing Peacce&quot; and another young girl is painted naked by a French artist in &quot;Seeing Things Simply&quot;. A woman randomly sees her mother walking down the street in New York City in &quot;New York Day Women&quot; and realizes that she has a life unto herself, while in &quot;Caroline's Wedding&quot;, the longest and last short story in the book, a daugther gets married to a man her mother disapproves of because he is not Haitian.Perhaps the most poignant part of &quot;Krik? Krak!&quot; is the epilogue which reveals why Edwidge Danticat, the young author of the book, writes these stories. For her and many other women they represent an oral history passed down from mother to daughter, and from that daughter to her daughter and so on. Each short story in this book is an example of such a rich oral tradition and is a very convincing glimpse into the lives of some Haitians and Haitian-Americans. If you read Krik? Krak! and discover that you like it as much as I did, and are interested in more books dealing with a mother/daughter and/or immigration theme, I also recommend &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; by Amy Tan, &quot;Two Novellas: First Love and Look for my Obituary&quot; by Elena Garro, &quot;Our House in the Last World&quot; by Oscar Hijuelos, and &quot;White Oleander&quot; by Janet Fitch. ..."},{"Title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"Krik! Krak! Edwidge Dandicat's second stroke of genius (the first being Breath, Eyes, Memory), takes readers through the terrors and triumphs of Haitian life with nine short stories. In Haitian folklore, storytellers say Krik! to alert listeners that a story is about to be told. Krak! is the response of listeners alerting the storyteller that they want a good tale told.Dandicat not only captures the essence of Haiti, but the deeper levels of the human spirit with her trademark lyrical prose. A doomed refugee adrift on a cruel sea, a knowing prostitute and a frustrated father battling with the truth of his own dismal future are among the most memorable characters. Reading Danticat's splendid collection of stories gives you access to a world of people and places that you will grow to love. With tragic characters, subtle images of beauty and hope, and gestures that are never overdone.Danticat's writing accomplishes the greatest task of any short story writer; she lets you empathize with her characters and walk around in their shoes. These stories are good for the heart. In a time when book stores' shelves groan beneath the weight of \\"girlfriend fiction,\\" Dandicat's work is a refreshing reminder that good literature is not dead!"},{"Title":"Krik?

Krak!","review":"The stories in this collection succeed on two levels.First, they transport you to a place you haven't been, the horror and terror of poverty-stricken Haiti.Second, there is an arc to the collection as a whole. The stories taken together aren't as grim or horrifying as each one by itself. Together they tell of strength and perseverance in the face of difficulties and long odds.Some of the stories are a little ragged, but the book in total is a riveting read.Bill Chance"},{"Title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"Imagine visiting your mother in prison. Seeing her with a shaved head and so skinny you can see the depths of her rib cage. Imagine having to bring your mother a small portion of fried pork and having her eat it in bite size portions so she could save it to last for months. Imagine hearing your mother use her voice for the first time in days and the sorrowful, wispy tone that she would try to create. Imaging trying to speak to your mother but struggling to conjure up even the simplest words. This all becomes true in the story titled Nineteen Thirty-Seven from Edwidge Danticat's book Krik? Krak! The book tells nine stories of Haitian sorrow, pain, and love. Specifically in the story Nineteen Thirty-Seven, Danticat tells the story through a daughter's eye of a mother (Manman) imprisoned by the Haitian government. The story shows the sorrow felt by the daughter for having her mother imprisoned and seeing her in such horrific conditions, but also shows the faith the mother has; a theme that can be seen in the entire book.I suggest this book and \\"The Farming of Bones\\" by Danticat: both highly educate the reader to the horrors of the Haitian people."},{"Title":"Krik?

Krak!","review":"\\"Krik Krak\\" is an impressionistic look at the lives of Haitians living in their native country and in America. The story's images are the strongest part of the book -- a mother, in denial after the stillbirth of a child, clutches its dead body. A father plummets inexplicably from a hot air balloon. A young bride-to-be, missing an arm, shops for a prosthesis for her wedding day accompanied by her superstitious mother. If the the story had an arc, it was subtle -- perhaps the progression from desperate escapee to semi-established in a new land.Danticat has a lyrical writing style full of wonderful images and a deep love for her characters. A fine book, probably most attractive to those in love with all things Haitian."},{"Title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"This collection of nine short stories was somewhat depressing to read. The stories of, for the most part, poverty stricken Haitian people were very intense and hard to believe. These stories show the amazing will power of these people despite the harsh oppression facing them. Danticat is a wonderful writer especially since she started at such a young age. Her different writing styles and technique make the reading very interesting and unique. She also uses a form of poetry that is very well done.

What i also liked was the way the many different perspectives were made to make ONE SINGLE CONNECTION. Everybody lived that same life and everybody gave their effort to make a different living out of what they had already experienced. The only thing that disapointed me was the constant usage of wings and blood, which made me think that they were symbolically placed there, but it just made me more confused about what i was reading.

If ever you thought that the world was perfect, then this book brings you outside of that box, for Edwidge Danticat acts as the voice for all those silenced Haitians and tells a tale that may have been left untold for so long. This book is far from your average historic novel, it goes so deep into the emotion, into the thoughts, into the physical feel of the characters, that even you cannot help but admire the context of the book.This book proved to me that the world really isn't perfect, and I doubt it will ever be.

The short stories are poetry to those who like poetry, they are anthropology for those who seek a better understanding of the culture, and they a feminist literature for those who would define it as such.While some might find them &quot;overdone&quot;, I find them magnificent, like Haitian art."},{"Title":"Krik?

Krak!","review":"Krik Krak was assigned to us for my first year english class in college. I was not anxious to read it however; after reading it I began to feel connected with the author. Even though none of these storeis are true to life, the ideas that they are based on are amazing. How anyone could survive under the circumstances is incredible. When people think of Haiti most of them would say that there were colorful costumes and all the inhabitants are delightful. Krik Krak depicts Haiti as a dark militarized place in which the unspeakable happens. This book had changed my life. Now I know what I have based on what others are lacking and it showed me so much of what I take for granted."},{"Title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"\\"Sometimes you dream of hearing only the beating of your own heart, but this has never been the case. You have never been able to escape the pounding of a thousand other hearts that have outlived yours by thousands of years. And over the years when you have needed us, you have always cried \\"Krik?\\" and we have answered \\"Krak!\\" and it has shown us that you have not forgotten us.\\"Edwidge Danticat describes a call and answer storytelling tradition of her Haitian homeland at the conclusion of Krik? Krak! as an interaction between the living and their ancestors.The first story in the collection, \\"Children of the Sea,\\" is told through letters from a young man escaping Haiti by boat, and the thoughts of the young woman he left behind. This nameless girl and boy recount the details of what occurs around them, naming individuals while they themselves remain nameless. Though they boy never reaches Miami and the letters are never sent the two remain connected.The last story, \\"Caroline's Wedding,\\" is set in New York. It describes the wedding of a Haitian American woman through her sister's eyes. It is a simple story that shows the difficulty of living in multiple cultures. It contrasts the American lifestyle with the poverty and suffering in Haiti, yet somehow the culture of Haiti is realized in color and New York is little described.The connecting theme for all the stories is \\"Ville Rose\\" a small town which is the natal village of many of the individuals in the stories. This linking of the stories makes them seem more like a continuous narrative then they would be which is better, I think, then short story collections with discrete stories. Unsurprisingly, the stories are quite unremittingly sad, despite which they are worth reading."},{"Title":"Krik?

Krak!, Edwidge Dandicat's second stroke of genius (the first being Breath, Eyes, Memory), takes readers through the terrors and triumphs of Haitian life with nine short stories. In Haitian folklore, storytellers say Krik! to alert listeners that a story is about to be told. Krak! is the response of listeners alerting the storyteller that they want a good tale told. Dandicat not only captures the essence of Haiti, but the deeper levels of the human spirit with her trademark lyrical prose. A doomed refugee adrift on a cruel sea, a knowing prostitute and a frustrated father battling with the truth of his own dismal future are among the most memorable characters.

In a different story when a mother gave birth to a baby and the child died, it was heartbreaking.

This construction arises when considering two smooth compact oriented manifolds M and M' which belong to the same 'oriented cobordism class'. This means that there exists a smooth compact oriented with boundary whose boundary (with the induced orientation) is diffeomorphic to the disjoint union of M and -M', where -M' is the manifold M' with the opposite orientation. It is straightforward to show that oriented cobordism is an equivalence relation and that the collection of oriented cobordism classes of manifolds is an Abelian group with group operation the disjoint union. In addition, the operation of Cartesian product makes the sequence (ordered under dimension) of oriented cobordism a graded ring: the 'oriented cobordism ring.' Tools from algebraic topology, such as the theory of characteristic classes (more specifically, the Pontryagin classes), are used to study the oriented cobordism ring. Another construction used to study this ring is the universal Thom space, which is a kind of generalization of the universal vector bundle (or \\"classifying space\\") in homotopy theory. One can show that the m-dimensional homotopy groups of the universal Thom space (with a base point) are canonically isomorphic to the oriented cobordism group. This fact allows one to prove that the oriented cobordism group is finite for non-zero dimension modulo 4, and is finitely generated with rank equal to the number of partitions of r, when the dimension is equal to 4r. If the oriented cobordism ring is tensored with the rational numbers, thus removing torsion, then one can show that this tensor product is a polynomial algebra with generators CP(2), CP(4), CP(6), .... where CP(n) is complex n-dimensional projective space. The sequence CP(2), CP(4), .... is an example of what is called a 'basic sequence' of manifolds.The characteristic classes used to distinguish one manifold from another usually involve relations between polynomials, and to establish the properties of these polynomials once and for all, the mathematician F. Hirzebruch introduced 'multiplicative sequences' of polynomials. The nth term of a multiplicative sequence is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n and they can be used to describe the relations between the characteristic classes, such as the Pontryagin, Chern, and Stiefel-Whitney classes, of vector bundles. Working with the characteristic classes of vector bundles reveals that they frequently have the form of power series. Multiplicative sequences can be uniquely associated with power series as Hirzebruch showed, and those sequences with rational coefficients are of particular interest since they are used to define the 'genus' of a compact, oriented, smooth manifold. One can show that the correspondence between the manifold and its genus gives rise to a ring homomorphism between the cobordism ring and the rational numbers Q (i.e. a homomorphism from the tensor product of the cobordism ring with Q to Q). This result gives rise to the famous Hirzebruch signature for manifolds whose dimension is a multiple of 4, which can be written in terms of a linear function of the Pontryagin numbers. The multiplicative sequence of polynomials in this case is associated to the hyperbolic tangent function with power series involving the Bernoulli numbers, and the Hirzebruch signature can be shown to be equal to the genus (the 'L-genus') arising from the multiplicative sequence, which it turns out is always an integer.This book begins by showing that these kinds of constructions dealing as they do with hyperbolic functions (and their corresponding 'addition formula') are special cases of what that author calls the 'universal elliptic genus.' The L-genus is a \\"degenerate\\" case of the elliptic genus (with the famous \\"A-genus\\" being another degenerate case). This degeneracy is related somewhat loosely to the fact that the ordinary trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions are degenerate cases of elliptic functions. The genus is actually defined for integral domains R over Q, and is a ring homomorphism from the tensor product of the oriented cobordism ring with Q to R (to be called here the rationalized cobordism ring), that maps the identity element of this tensor product to the identity element of R. The author shows how every genus arises from a power series by using the logarithm associated with the genus and the notion of a 'formal group law' (which is essentially a generalization of the trigonometric and hyperbolic addition formulas). The logarithm determines the formal group law, and using this the author gives conditions, involving power series, for finding when one genus has the same logarithm as another. The L-genus falls out for a power series expansion of x/tanh(x) (with formal group law the addition formula for the hyperbolic tangent), while one obtains the A-genus for the power expansion of (x/2)/sinh(x/2) (with formal group law the addition formula for sinh(x+y)). The author then shows that these are degenerate cases of the universal elliptic genus whose addition formula arises from the problem of doubling the arc length along a lemniscate and whose logarithm depends on two parameters 'd' and 'e'. When d = -1/8, e = 0 one captures the A-genus, whereas the L-genus arises when d = e = 1. These examples motivate the definition of a 'universal formal group law', with the designation as 'universal' arising from the fact that the group law is respected by all homomorphisms from the rationalized cobordism ring to R. An important property of the elliptic genus is that it is 'multiplicative' with respect to Cartesian products and locally trivial fibrations. The genus is called 'strongly multiplicative' if it is multiplicative for spin fibrations whose structural groups are compact and connected. The author shows that if a genus is strongly multiplicative, then it is elliptic. The proof involves the use of 'Milnor manifolds', which are essentially fibrations where the total space and base space are complex projective spaces. The use of Milnor manifolds is perhaps not surprising since the elliptic genus is determined by its values on complex projective spaces (specifically on CP(2) and (quaternionic) HP(2)).The goal of the author is to show that there are cases where the elliptic genus is 'nondegenerate'. He does this in the context of the sporadic Mathieu group after spending a few chapters elaborating on how to construct elliptic cohomology theory. Elliptic cohomology theory is an \\"extraordinary\\" cohomology theory, in that the dimension axiom does not hold. The key to understanding these early chapters are the grasp of the notions of a 'multiplicative' cohomology theory on finite groups and a generalization of character theory on (finite) groups called the 'Mackey functor.' A multiplicative cohomology theory is one where each of the cohomology groups has the structure of a graded commutative ring. Complex K-theory is a multiplicative cohomology theory where the multiplication arises from the tensor product of complex vector bundles. For a ring A and a finite group G, the Mackey functor is a functor from the category of subgroups of G (with morphisms generated by inclusions and conjugations) to the family of A-modules which has induction and restriction maps and that has a double coset formula. A map from the subgroups of G to the (complex-oriented) cohomology of their classifying space is a Mackey functor, and the author shows that in fact it is a 'Green functor' in that the family of modules has a multiplicative structure and the restriction and induction maps satisfy Frobenius reciprocity. This gives rise to a group cohomology that generalizes that of the ordinary cohomology of the classifying space BG of the group G. The author shows how to compute this cohomology for BG, the first result being that for cyclic prime subgroups of G, the (complex oriented) cohomology is generated by the Chern classes. The author then shows that if one specializes to the case of elliptic cohomology, then for odd primes less than 24, the elliptic cohomology of the classifying space of the Mathieu group with 24 elements is concentrated in even dimensions."},{"Title":"The press and the cold war","review":"This is a curiously dispassionate book, at least in tone. Given the author's connection to radical causes over the years and his persecution during the Mc Carthy period, he apparently harbors few grudges. It would seem that his regard for press freedom is stronger than any commitment to radical doctrine, there being precious little of that anywhere in the book. This, of course, is contrary to usual stereotype of the radical journalist as propagated in the popular media. Still, I'm not sure whether his detached style helps or hinders the book's message; nevertheless, it contrasts unexpectedly with the more impassioned and ironical style of Chomsky and Herman, two academics who cover much of the same ground.Most of the text retraces familiar material concerning Cold War journalism. Perhaps the best chapter is the one characterizing the liberal mentality that reported from Vietnam, paticularly during the early years. Skeptical of official versions and wary of top military brass, reporters such as David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan were raised to near heroic dimensions by liberal critics of the war. And while their skepticism toward Pentagon duplicity and a corrupt client government in Saigon never wavered, not once did these fabled journalists question the basic moral correctness of America's involvement. In short, when push came to shove, they refused to follow the logic of their own facts to the appropriate conclusion. No doubt consistency in this regard would have cost them their jobs and maybe careers. Even so, Aronson's account makes clear just how opaque the enemy and their cause was to these quondam rebels and how wedded Halbertam and company were to official illusion. Far from being heroes, their real function, as Aronson emphasizes, was to project the illusions of nation-building into yet further spheres of foreign intervention. A second point of interest comes at the book's conclusion. According to pollsters, reporters and media generally are held in low popular esteem; the reason, Aronson observes, is not because of the supposed power of the media, as the political right-wing prefers. Rather it's because the public senses, correctly, that this power is not being exercised in their behalf. Indeed. Marred only by an occasionally flat style, Aronson's is a revealing book by a journalist who demands no less of others in his profession than he does of himself."},{"Title":"Insight Pocket Guide Quebec (Insight Guides)","review":"This book was too general to be of much use.

From the very 1st page, I was already in love with Shiwa House and the mysterious Lake of the Royal Crocodiles. Ive never imagined such a magical place could exist!!! Gore Brown's love for Africa, its lands and peoples, is clearly evident, but I found his sometimes patronizing attitude annoying: he despaired that his servants would never appreciate opera like the white man etc. In spite of this, I highly recommend this to everyone ... not just architects and travellers. Some day I must see Shiwa Ngandu for myself!!!"},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"Christina Lamb writes like one possessed, and her latest book takes us deep into the inner life of one of nature's gentlemen, the 20th century adventurer and baronet Sir Stewart Gore Browne, who died in 1967. Gore Browne led an exciting life, yet like the man portrayed in Werner Herzog's film FITZCARRALDO, who tried to bring garnd opera to a little town on the wrong side of a Peruvian mountain, his obsessions are hard to separate from his derangement. In the case of Fitzcarraldo, he attempted to building a Western-style opera house in the jungles of Peru; Gore Browne had similar dreams of building an old fahsioned country manor a la Walter Scott's Waverley novels in the middle of what was then Rhodesia. In both cases everythinghad to be imported for thousands of miles--in Gore-Browne's case that included a wife. And what a wife! It seems that he only married her because he had once been in love with her mother--surely a strange story, and one that you don't hear that much of any more. You'd have to turn to the magnificent Snopes trilogy (by William Faulkner) to find this quasi-incestuous story told so delicately and with such perception.Christina Lamb did a lot of homework before writing this book, even going to the tumbledown mansion where, as she writes, she would pull a book from the library shelves and it would crumble in her hands (due to Rhodesian humidity and the family's neglect of the old estate). Her descriptions of going to this haunted mansion are almost as romantic as the first pages of REBECCA by Daphne Du Maurier (\\"Last night I dreamed I went to Manderley again\\") and understanding Gore Browne's character in the light of British romantic novels will help us understand this odd old duffer, a man who championed the cause of black freedom and yet kept a cast of servant as though they were slaves.The bad thing about the book is Lamb's reliance on cliches and the fact that her writing resembles a Harlequin romance of the 1960s. There is little or no attempt to understand the politics that shaped Gore Browne's career. It is all about the inner man."},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"First off, Ms. Lamb did an exceptional job writing a very complex story. She is an excellent writer and she is a vivid story teller. My three stars are based on the topic rather than the writing.Stewart Gore-Browne was a character if one were being \\"Politically Correct\\". I found him to be a man full of contradictions and down right creepy. In today's world, he would either be a celebrity of the caliber of Donald Trump or getting lots of psychiatric care or both (given societies perverse need to follow \\"real housewives of wherever\\" or other \\"reality\\" shows. In this instance, it is most akin to \\"Survivor\\" but with lots of money.Initially, the story begins by establishing that Gore-Browne was not a favored child nor given much affection by his parents. In his perspective, the only attention he did receive focused on his inadequacies compared to his brother. Living in his brother's shadow caused him to seek love and attention from a childless aunt and uncle. His relationship with the aunt alludes to an illicit love and one wonders based on their extensive letter writing (daily for much of their adult lives) and the type of things written that this was not a mother/son relationship, the question remains if their sexual desires resulted in sexual intercourse, particularly when he was a young man. Their \\"affection\\" and secretiveness throughout their adult years reveal a continued attraction.After serving in the First World War, Gore-Browne was disappointed in his status within the British military rank; although he did accomplish several promotions and gained the trust of high level officials, he felt under appreciated and deserving of more. While in the service, he was sent to do land survey work for the British Empire of Rhodesia. This began his love affair with the country. He concluded that he could become an \\"accomplished\\" man by building his own empire within Rhodesia. Spawning his relocation to a picturesque region to build his estate and fortune via farming.He spends a fortune importing the finest things from Europe to furnish his estate. He employees many natives in the building of the estate and planted various crops. His arrogance in attempting to control the land and assuming that whatever he planted would grow, further demonstrate his folly. Although, he hired two men to manage the estate, there was friction both professionally and socially with them. He rarely listened to their advice and eventually both tired of him and left.Throughout his years, he begs and woos his wealthy aunt to leave his uncle in Great Britain to live with him in Rhodesia; this same aunt and uncle are underwriting the financial funding of his \\"empire\\". It isn't quite clear if she is leading him on because she never says no to his requests for her relocation except later his uncle becomes infirm. Meanwhile, their affair of the heart continues - he expresses guilt for his actions but rationalizes them away, reasoning that his uncle knows about the nature of their relationship. Additionally, this same uncle also has great affection for him and has already informed Gore-Browne, that he will inherit their entire estate, thus the heir apparent, another nephew from the other side of the family has been removed from the will.After many years of loneliness, he returns to Britain for a visit and he meets the daughter of his only true love of his youth,(she had married another when he failed to propose to her). It was a choice he always regretted. Now upon meeting her daughter, at least 20 years his junior, and a widow with two young children (and no money), Gore-Browne proposes in a few days since she is scheduled to leave the country within a week. They marry and return to Rhodesia. It was a few chapters later that I quit reading. I know people marry for a variety of reasons and he expresses some level of affection for her (they had children together). It just seemed so odd for him to be pursuing his aunt for 20 years only to propose within two or three days of meeting this young woman he didn't know.Yes, other reviewers approve of his respect for the ways of the native Rhodesians and he had earned their admiration. This is commendable, however, his behavior with his house servants dismayed me. If one failed to uphold his standards, they were soundly ridiculed. He even beat his employees!His behavior was very arbitrary and contradictory. His need to control his environment was almost laughable. His lack of social skills is demonstrated over and over again, which was immensely frustrating to me. Truly, he was his own worst enemy - as so many people are. Which often makes for good reading material hence all the 5 stars. If I had liked him as a person, I would have been more tolerant and finished the book. To me, he just seemed to unbalanced and strange (creepy)."},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"If you like to read about excentrics, this is a great book.The tenacity and adversity that on a daily basis came to challenge Stewart Gore-Brown, would destroy and give up, for many of us. But he dug in and persevered and succeeded, till Africa claimed back what he had taken, after his death.Great story, a gem of a book."},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"Christina Lamb has been fortunate that the subject of her biography, Stewart Gore-Browne, was a prolific diarist and letter writer who recorded a huge amount of detail about his daily life, his feelings and attitudes, and the physical environment in which he lived. She has made brilliant and evocative use of her material.Gore-Browne was born in 1883 into an Establishment family (father a barrister, one uncle a bishop, another a vice-admiral). He had little rapport with his parents, but a great deal with his father's younger sister, the sprightly Ethel Locke-King, whom he adored as more than a mother-figure: at one time she had gently to remind him of the Seventh Commandment. His correspondence with her is the source of much of the first part of the book: in Africa he would write to her every other day; and later he wrote a weekly letter to his friend Roy Welensky.He joined the Army, and in 1911, at the age of 28, went to Africa to work on the Anglo-Belgian Border Commission which was mapping the border between Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo. He fell in love with the country, and in particular with a remote spot by a lake called Shiwa Ngandu, where he was determined to build for himself one day a great English-style country house at the centre of an estate. He had begun with a few huts for himself and his Bemba labourers; after three months he paid what was meant to be a short visit to England; but the War broke out, and he served on the Western Front. In 1920 he returned to Shiwa Ngandu. He had acquired 23,000 acres of land from the British South Africa Company, half as a grant to ex-soldiers and the other half at a shilling an acre. He initially had two Englishmen to work with him; but apart from them, the nearest white people at the time were a missionary couple living some sixty miles away. He was then a bachelor: for three years from the age of 21 he had been deeply in love with a girl who married someone else; and he thought he could never marry anyone else.Much of the first half of the book, then, is taken up with his amazing undertaking, as the great house and its landscaped approach took shape. By 1926 he had a permanent staff of 356 working in the house and on the estate; sometimes more than 1,200 people worked for him. The men were paid 5d a day, the women 2d. (There were many years when the estate did not pay for itself, and he could afford the expense only by drawing on his intended inheritance as the heir of the wealthy Ethel.) His authority over the men was extensive. Though he liked and admired the Bemba for the most part and disliked the patronizing attitudes towards Africans of other settlers, he sometimes expressed these himself. He was a martinet with a short temper and occasionally beat them fiercely. The house servants wore white gloves, scarlet waistcoats over white tops, scarlet bermuda shorts and patent leather shoes when they served his meals on beautiful china brought out from England: he always dressed formally for dinner.On a visit to England at the end of the first half of the book, he met the orphaned daughter of his first love: she seemed her mother's spitting image; he married her, and she went out to Africa with him. She was 18, he was 43. Initially she was as interested in Shiwa as he was, but eventuallly, to his great sadness, the marriage broke down.In 1935 he was persuaded to stand for election to the (whites only) Legislative Council of Northern Rhodesia, and became a member of the Executive in 1939. For all his patriarchal behaviour on the estate and his often expressed despair at the incompetence or unreliability of his African workers, he became known not only for being (according to him) the only one of the 22 members of LegCo to be interested in African welfare and development, but for his view that Africans should be prepared for partnership in running the country and for his attacks on the colour bar in shops and public places. He scandalized his colleagues by having Africans at his dinner parties. He financed the education at Makarere University of Harry Nkumbula (later President of the Northern Rhodesian African Congress), spotted the 21 year old Kenneth Kaunda as one of the likely future leaders of black Africans, and was in correspondence with Hastings Banda, the future leader of Nyasaland (Malawi). He disapproved of the creation of the Central African Federation, though his friend Roy Welensky was its Prime Minister. It had been created to merge the small number of whites in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with the more numerous whites in Southern Rhodesia who were even tougher in keeping Africans in their place. Though in the early 1950s Gore-Browne had thought that the Africans were not ready for independence, by the late fifties he not only though it was inevitable, but that they could and should run the country. He dined publicly in a Lusaka hotel with Kaunda, gave funds to his increasingly militant party, joined it formally in 1961, and, after the Central African Federation had collapsed, took part in the negotiations with the British which led in 1964 to the independence of Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, with Kaunda as President. When Gore-Browne died, aged 84, in 1967, Kaunda ordered a state funeral for him.This beautiful book ends with an elegiac chapter covering the last three years of this remarkable man, who was in so many ways a typical upper-class Englishman of his time, but in many others quite unique."},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"This book tells a true story of colonial Africa. It chronicles how one man's love for Africa laid the foundation for growth in the early years of the last century. It describes how he overcame any number of challenges to hold onto his dream, and ultimately contributed to the current state of the nation."},{"Title":"Effects of long-run demographic changes in a multi-country model (IMF working paper)","review":"I tracked this book down after seeing a picture of Shiwa House, an abandoned English country estate in the heart of Northern Africa on some website. It turns out that it was built between the two world wars by Sir Gordon Stewart Brown on a declining inheritance that went unusually far in the wreckage of British imperialism. This twenty-room mansion stood self-sufficient with modern amenities and its owner spent his days hunting rhinoceros and reading the classics in Latin from a fully stocked library.Of course this fantasy came at a great cost, he lost his family and most of his fortune in the process and when he died it was almost immediately left to be reclaimed by the continent. What I always take from these books is how we moralists sit back and judge the consequences of these driven or compelled men, tsking at Hearst for his preposterous visions of some West Coast Castle and yet we have no problem admiring or enjoying the results of their labors. The fact of the matter is that many great things come from their dispute against reality. Perhaps it is not my path, but I have some empathy for it."},{"Title":"English literature: modern (The home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"This has some enjoyable reading collected together for Kindle, and the table of contents will reveal specific works that Kindle readers can enjoy."},{"Title":"Writing, Reading, and Research","review":"Daughter's college book, but let me say that she did pick up some great skills from this book.

I look forward to using it soon"},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"Purchase was easy and came promptly in the mail. Good product. Thank you."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"My proficiency level with Excel is not that high, so when I started a new job that required more Excel knowledge than I have, I bought this book based on the positive feedback it received. I have been very pleased with the book. I have not read it cover-to-cover, but it has worked well for what I need, which is mostly just for looking up how to perform specific tasks. For me, the index is the most important part of any technical book. I want to be able to find what I need as quickly as possible, and the index in this book has been great."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"Prior to owning this book, I was fairly experienced with Excel, using techniques that I had either taught myself or picked up from friends. I am working as an intern this summer at a big company, and I knew that Excel and I were going to be spending a lot of time together so I decided to get a book to really learn the ins and outs of the program. Well, this book showed me just that; I learned new subtleties for topics I considered basic (formatting, basic formulas, etc.), and things I didn't even know Excel could do (arrays, pivot tables,...). The book does a great job (most of the time) of explaining the the topics presented, and it includes a CD containing example worksheets that you can work through to see exactly what how everything comes together.One thing that this book does not do comprehensively is VBA, which the author acknowledges. It gives a basic overview of how to write fairly basic macros, but the author has a separate book that really gets into the meat of VBA in Excel.All in all, a great book, I reference it almost every day at work."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"I am an Excel novice, and the \\"Excel Bible - 2003\\" was a fantastic ready reference book for me. If you plan on doing ANY sort of analytical work on your PC, I highly reccomend using Microsoft Excel. As such, this book will help you successfully navigate through your first few days, weeks, and years of Excel.Also, Mr. Walkenbach (the author) is very accessable. I had a few basic questions for him regarding Excel formulas, sent him an e-mail and had a response within 48 hours. Pretty remarkable, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"The book is really a Bible... A lot of useful information for people that are beginning to use this spreadsheet. I also believe that this book could be a great asset for those who have a good understanding of the tool.

I really have to recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"Perhaps I expected too much, but this book is so voluminous that one assumes it should contain all the answers to Excel related questions (as many people believe the books of \`Bible' type should :-). On my second try, I was greatly disappointed to find that the only reference on important programming function \`ADDRESS' is a one-line definition! So, if you never used Excel before, I guess this book would be a good place to start. Otherwise, continue to search for the true Holly Book elsewhere."},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"This book sucks! I cannot even believe that the author or publisher can refer to this piece of WHATEVER as a Bible! The first 600 pages only REFERENCE (and by reference, I mean DO NOT describe in any detail that is usable) the basics of Excel that many of us learned in introductory computer classes. I bought this book to learn more about Visual Basic Editor (VBE) and UserForms. Unfortunately, this 'Bible' only recommends another book by the same author devoted to these topics. This was a serious waste of $40!! I honestly think that new users to Excel could benefit from the free Excel tutorials that are offered online or by using one of those books made for 'dummies' that are MUCH cheaper!"},{"Title":"Excel 2003 Bible","review":"And I thought that I knew Microsoft Excel.

This is my fourth excel book by Mr. Walkenbach and they are all of equal caliber. They all contain general background information as well as information dealing with other programming areas of excel (so that even if you only purchase a book like the VBA programming guide, you will still learn about macro programming and other general excel functions).

Eventhough the subject is difficult, this book gives plenty of arguments why it is crucial to reflect afresh on the subject, take a positive pro-active attitude towards prevention and help for victims and abusers. Not a light read by any means, but definetly a must for anyone seriously interested in the welfare and well-being of children within the family, as well as within the community."},{"Title":"How to survive in the wilderness","review":"This book is great, it tells you all the information you would ever need to know about living in the wild (i.e. makeshift fishing, what to eat, etc.). It even has illustrations of plants that are edible. For camping and such this is the perfect handbook."},{"Title":"Atlantis, Beyond the Pillars of Hercules","review":"This is a novel that starts with an interesting premise, but goes down after the first fifty or so pages. Without giving too much away, it has to do with Paul Schliemann, who claimed to be the grandson of Heinrich Schliemann, discoverer of Troy, who, in 1912, claimed to have artificacts his grandfather found detailing the existence of Atlantis. Well, shortly after the claim, Paul was never heard from again and the book postulates that a voyage aboard the Titanic might have interferred with the planned unveiling. Leap ahead some eighty or so years from then and the artficacts are discovered again, along with a map purporting to show Atlantis' location - on the Greek island of Thera - and the rest of the book is spent getting up an expedition and fighting over permits. Finally, after almost three hundred pages, the expedition reaches it's destination, Thera. This book lacks the drama that could have made it a page-turner, and the ending is unsatisfying. The writer has done some basic research, and the characters frequently go on about it, but this book doesn't even come close to realizing the potential of it's themes. Not only that, too often do writers take the lazy way out these days, linking Atlantis with poor old Thera/Santorini when modern research has discredited it as the location of Atlantis. Better fiction on Atlantis, in fact, would be Roger Didio's &quot;Atlantis, A Tale of the Earth&quot; or Marion Zimmer Bradley's &quot;The fall of Atlantis.&quot; Then, too, those books deal with Atlantis as an actual place, not as a simple plot device."},{"Title":"Mayflies: Top to Bottom","review":"I've had this book for a few weeks now and every time I open it up, I'm blown away again by the entire package. This is one of the most interesting fly tying books I've ever read! The photography is sharp and the instructions are crystal clear.The book starts off with the normal section on material and tool selection that you'll find in any fly tying book. This book is set apart from the rest because there are high quality photos of various materials organized into color charts for assorted dubbings and other body materials. While Shane Stalcup has invented many of these materials and therefore has an interest in their success, the idea behind each is clearly explained and suggestions are made for use.The rest of the book is divided into sections for nymphs, dries, spinners, emergers and cripples and each section has plenty of ideas which you've more than likely never seen before. Crystal clear photographs and simple but effective text accompany each fly in the book and color variations which will work on your local hatches are presented for each fly.I was a big fan of Shane Stalcup's tying before looking over this book, but now that I've seen it, I'm on a new level of appreciation! Aside from that, I've got a lot of new ideas I can apply to patterns I'm developing. To make it short, I consider this book essential because its the most interesting and imaginative pattern book I've ever seen!"},{"Title":"Mayflies: Top to Bottom","review":"In Mayflies: Top To Bottom, Shane Stalcup draws upon his more than twenty years of commercial expertise in tying flies for anglers around the world to show trout fishermen how to tie an effective, lifelike mayfly lure that will prove irresistible to their favorite game fish. Full-color photography superbly illustrates each expert innovative fly tying technique and project. An informed and informative discussion of fly tying materials and practices make Mayflies: Top To Bottom (also available in a Spiral Hardbound edition: 157188243X, $...) an indispensable and enthusiastically recommended addition to any dedicated angler's reference shelf."},{"Title":"The gist of the Bible: A complete handbook for class and home study","review":"The content of this book is excellent, but the print of this paperback book is small with large white margins.

Andy has some unique flavor combinations which are much harder adjusting if you don't have everything you need, or if you want to fit them to your taste."},{"Title":"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine","review":"I recently got my copy of The Fearless Chef and am systematically working my way through the recipes. I'm still in appetizers (well, I'm in appetizers and in drinks, because I'm working my way through from both the front and the back of the book). Husbands makes the ordinary new again. Like devilled eggs? You'll flip for the these fearless ones--they're nothing like my grandmother used to make. The chopped salads bring salad flavor quotients to an entirely new level--these things are amazing. So far the nosh and salad dishes are riffs on something familiar but with new flavor combinations and juxtapositions. The tastes and textures are bold and subtle--there's always more going on than you'd expect. So far the recipes have been very accessible and the ingredients available; they're heavy on fresh herbs and freshly toasted whole spices. The writing style is humorous and easy to read and filled with useful background information on ingredients and techniques (who knew that the secret to really good southern style biscuits is a flour called Lily White (or is it While Lily?)? It's one of those cookbooks that's not only good to cook from, but is fun to read because the voice comes through so brightly (you get the clear sense that Husbands and Yonan have had interesting lives and have been focused on food for a long time). The one drawback that I've found so far is that the typeface and positioning for the names of recipes is a little hard to get used to. But then soon enough my pages will be so splatted with the fruits of these recipes that it won't really matter. A great cookbook all around."},{"Title":"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine","review":"I've been a patron of Andy's restaurants for close to a decade.

When we have managed to cook, it's been mostly simple stuff. This year we took a four-day weekend to celebrate our anniversary, and we decided to cook up a true feast on Monday. This seemed the perfect opportunity to test out Andy Husbands and Joe Yonan's \\"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine.\\" Reading through the recipes, they looked like exactly our kind of food; we couldn't wait to try them out.One of the recipes turned out absoluteley spectacularly--a soy glaze that we put over noodles. Other recipes were good but not great; a mango and cabbage salad and some beans both tasted a bit unbalanced in flavor. In particular, the beans tasted overwhelmingly of the beer that went into them (I'm sure some would see that as a plus!).Dessert is where the excitement came in. We made a bananas Foster-like recipe that involved a full cup of rum (I had to triple-check the amount because I found it so hard to believe). When we opened the oven at the end of the baking time I heard a whooshing sound and the slam of the oven door. Then I smelled burnt hair. I whipped around, and when my husband turned to face me all I could say was, \\"umm, you should look in a mirror.\\" His eyebrows and eyelashes, and the front row of his hair, had all been burned partially off. A gout of flame had apparently shot straight out of the oven when he opened it up.Nothing like that has ever happened to us before.Dessert was still edible, believe it or not, but once again, just like the beans, the taste of alcohol was so overwhelming that I almost couldn't taste anything else. And no matter how much I love that soy glaze, I can't quite get past that fireball."},{"Title":"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine","review":"We have been patrons of Andy's restaurants for years and have been anxiously awaiting this masterpiece. Andy and Joe have written a cookbbook that is not only fun to read, but easy to use. It offers new twists on old favorites as well as bold and flavorful originals. Some favorites to date include his wacky interpretation of Deviled Eggs (Delpha'd Eggs), his wicked spicy Kung Pao Shrimp with Cashews and Mangoes (a real crowd pleaser), Chicken Chicharrones with Limed Sour Cream, and Barbecued Shrimp with Hominy.Fear not this is no ordinary cookbook. Andy continues to deliver the same adventurous American cuisine that has made his restaurants so popular. It is sure to please not only the cook, but also any family and friends who are lucky enough to be invited over when it is being used."},{"Title":"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine","review":"I bought this book so I could learn how to make some of the stuff that are in the resturants that Andy set up. FOr the most part they ended up tasting fairly similar to the stuff at the resturant. Some of the stuff is hard to make, but over all the book is filled with lots of delicious interesting unique recipies. Highly reccommended, not to mention the book is a very easy fun read"},{"Title":"The Fearless Chef: Innovative Recipes from the Edge of American Cuisine","review":"by the Meatloaf, Blueberry Bread Pudding and Fontina Tater recipes found within this book. My reputation for Sunday dinner in our family has been spotty at best.

Andy Husbands has created a book that brings the flavor and personality of his great Boston and Providence restaurants to print and makes them very accessible to the home cook. From the Chicarrones (which I personally wrap in lettuce leaves rather than tortillas to save on carbs and add crunch) to the Lamb Tagine which has flavors I haven't tasted since I last visited Africa, every recipe explodes with flavor yet incorporates easy to find ingredients and simple techniques. And to top it all off, the book is filled with personal stories that kept me up reading all night. I love this book and countless friends will be getting it as a holiday gift this year."},{"Title":"Life Lessons with Max Lucado: Book Of Mark","review":"Max Lucado's books are awesome, inspirational and help the reader study and get meaning from the word.

Even my own modest home bar, which I spent quite a bit on to stock for various tastes, was always missing some exotic ingredient required for almost every recipe contained in this book. I'd recommend the book if you have access to a very wide range of ingredients, but for everyone else, there are better books out there."},{"Title":"Classic & Contemporary Cocktails: The Essential Collection","review":"I learned a lot about making classis cocktails from the real ingredients from this book. I discovered it was British when it said \\"Buck's Fizz\\" for \\"Mimosa.\\" The downside is that the drinks don't appear to be in any logical order such as alphabetical or by liquor."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"All history books should be written as well as Thomas Costain's \\"The Three Edwards.\\" A comprehensive guide to the lives and labors of the great warrior kings Edward I and Edward III and the screw-up, Edward II, who ruled in between them, this book unfolds more like an easy-to-read and hard-to-put-down novel. Divided into short, easily manageable and well-organized chapters, it covers everything from the marriages of the kings and their children, the political highs and lows of their reigns, the manner of their deaths and the major battles of their wars. Many books about this era are hard to follow if you don't already have a good working knowledge of the time period. Costain avoids this problem by telling you who the people are, what they looked and acted liked, and why they are important to the story, helping you keep track of them by reminding you when he's spoken of them before, and generally describing the people so well that they don't just become a series of names that you can't keep track of. Although he obviously admires Edward I, has disdain for Edward II, and seems to be neutral toward Edward III, to whom about half the book is devoted, he is careful to point out both the good and bad in each of their characters and to place their actions in the context of their times. Plenty of space is given to the kings' ministers, merchants, wives and families, and to those of the Scottish and French rulers with whom the Edwards were at constant war, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, John Balliol, Philip the Fair, Jean the Good, and Charles the Bald.One of the things I love about this book is that Costain shares so many of the great rumors and stories that passed down over the ages (such as Edward I promising the Welsh that he will give them a prince that speaks no English or French and then appointing his newborn son to the post), simply because they are great stories, while taking pains to point out why they can't be true. You can almost feel Costain winking at you as he relates the tales. Another great aspect of the book is that he devotes substantial time to the women of the period, who are generally ignored in most books on the middle ages. Edward II's wife, Isabella of France, is examined in detail, as is Eleanor of Castille, the first and beloved wife of Edward I whose death moved him to erect eleven costly stone crosses to her memory.This book presents a very comprehensive overview of the lives and works of the three kings and is a great starting place for those who know very little about their lives, or a great review for those who've read much about them. You won't get every tiny bit of detail about Edward III's famous battles of Sluys, Crecy and Poitiers here that is found in, for instance, Jonathon Sumption's books on the Hundred Years War, but they are all well-summarized, and Costain includes many important details such as numbers of foot and mounted soldiers on each side, terrain, battle tactics and formations, and number of casualties as well as political motivations. Given the length of the book, there is a surprising wealth of detail packed into every page, including such wonderful tidbits as the origin of the word \\"blanket,\\" which came from the name of Thomas Blanket, an early English manufacturer of the item.In the last few months I have read over two dozen books on the middle ages, and this had been by far the most informative and enjoyable, the one book that really makes the events of the period come alive and the people seem to be actual people of flesh and blood, rather than just an amalgam of their deeds and accomplishments. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"This is one of a quartet that Costain wrote describing the monarchs and key events in European history from William the Conqueror to the War of the Roses. The history is accurate. It is always clear where Costain is speculating and where he is drawing on traditional sources, such as the various chronicles of the era. However, he weaves them together so smoothly that the reader needs concern her/himself with documentation only when it pleases. Costain is first and foremost a good story teller and an elegant writer."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Costain does a great job with this overview of the first named Edwards to lord it over the English throne. From the fierce but just Edward I (&quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot;) to the effete and ineffectual Edward II to the long-reigning and erratic Edward III, the author sustains our interest with anecdotes and thorough reporting of the times. Costain has a delightful habit of suddenly focusing on a historical figure one doesn't generally hear about and then presenting the reader with yet another biography to get excited about. Well done, well written. well read."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Like the other reviewers, I think this book is terrific, and well-worth reading for anyone interested in medieval English history. Even if you're simply a Mel Gibson fan interested in the real story about William Wallace (&quot;Braveheart&quot;), you might find the book edifying and entertaining. (Mel seems to have taken considerable liberty with the real story, perhaps relying on a poetic rendition of Wallace's exploits written 200 years after his death.) Edward I (&quot;Longshanks&quot;) is no modern liberal, of course, but he has redeeming points (being the &quot;English Justinian&quot; -- a lawgiver) not recognized in the movie. Costain's prose is consistently readable and entertaining. The subject matter, far from being dull, is inherently dramatic -- a reminder of how far human society has come since the barbarous Middle Ages. The book also creates appreciation for the unique aspects of English history, which made our Mother Country, for all its faults, the birthplace of modern democracy."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Costain has a touch for history, especially with the Plantagenets. This book follows the fortunes of two of the Plantagenet kings seen in Braveheart-Edward the Longshanks (Edward I) and his son, Edward II. Costain's very thorough work allows you to see the many facets of the larger than life Plantagents. Edward I so deeply loved his wife Eleanor that when she died, he erected &quot;Cherie Crosses&quot; to mark each place where her coffin rested on its way to burial. Edward II's passion for favorites did not end with the notorius Piers Gaveston, the Dispenser brothers were added to the long list of royal favorites. The son Isabella of France gave birth to became the fabled Edward III, the great Plantagenet warrior and victor of Crecy and Poitiers. (Isabella went on to a less than savory career, too.) Interested? Want to how all three Edwards were really shaped by their environment? Treat yourself to this book. It's history that reads like a novel. (Just in case you like it, there are four more books about the illustrious House Plantagenet!)"},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Why do such great books fall into obscurity? This fantastic narrative, which covers the reigns of Edward I, II, and III, is part of the 4-part Plantagenet series.

I hoped I'd find them over the years and finally just snagged them on Amazon. great works if you love history."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Costain originally published THE THREE EDWARDS in 1958. While he has an easy-to-read style, which as other reviewers have remarked, makes him as fun to read as a good novel, his opinions sometimes come off as pompous - even absurd - by today's standards. For instance, in writing about the love affair between Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, he says, \\"When a woman of passionate nature has existed in a loveless marriage and has reached the late twenties before yielding to a clandestine impulse, it may be taken for granted that she will not be guided by anything but the dictates of her love.\\"Later, about the woman who would become Queen Philippa, he writes, \\"Queen Philippa [in comparison to Isabella] had seemed rather colorless. She was pretty, sweet, and domestic, a typical Dutch girl.\\"The short section on Edward II never directly refers to the king's homosexuality. Rather, there are references to his \\"favorites.\\"If you can get past these prejudices, you'll learn a lot about 3 reigns - Edward I, II and III - in short order (the 1962 reprint that I read was slightly under 450 pages). Costain does a good job of summarizing the important events as well as the characters of the key men and women. There is also a good summary of the life of Edward III's son, Edward (called the Black Prince for the color of his armor).I also like the fact that he provides information on his sources - calling rumor, rumor and referring to some contemporary writers as gossipmongers."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"What Costain did with these books was to write a series of novels that were based on history but are bad history. Costain writes with purple prose that prejudges his subjects. You cannot do that with history. He constantly says how \\"bad\\" King John was. Was he? He had his failings but for a self-styled \\"historian\\" to call him \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\" at every turn is ridiculous. After all, some base their opinions of King Richard III on Shakespeare's play - which was written to set Richard in a bad light and Edward VII, the first of the Tudors (of which his patron, Elizabeth I, was one) in a good light. History has since shown that Richard III was a fine monarch nor was the deformed hunchback depicted by Shakespeare. Again, bad history, great play. In Costain's books nothing is footnoted, conversations are fabricated, and history is disregarded. For example, he says that King John signed the Magna Carta (which he misspells) and that there was one. Wrong! There were 41 copies and each was sealed by the King, not signed. A small error? No! If he gets that wrong, what about the rest? Again, good novel, bad history so read these as novels but do NOT take them as history."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"Costain combines an eye for detail and accuracy in a very readable style"},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"The history, I'm sure, is accurate and well-researched and well-written. Just, you know, very fifties. I read this on my Kindle, thinking that the publication date of 2011 referred to the actual text. It refers only to the date this 1958 book was converted to ebook format.The book covers the reign of the three Edwards--King Edward I, II, and III. The reign of Edward II was marred by the outrageously preferential treatment he gave to his male companions. Obviously sexuality is not something you can absolutely prove at a distance of hundreds of years, but the author only dances around the idea that Edward II's relationship with Gaveston and then with Despenser might have been sexual (the author uses the word \\"immoral.\\") The word \\"lover\\" is used only in reference to Mortimer, the probable lover of Edward's slighted and long-suffering wife Isabella. It is interesting to see that a 50's historian sees the relationship between a king and a man in terms of politics, and the relationship between a queen and a man in terms of sex. In the introductory section on Edward II, the text tells us that Edward had \\"favorites,\\" but tells us that Isabella was \\"beautiful but false\\" and had a \\"paramour.\\"When we re-read today's history texts in 60 years, what biases will we see that currently evade our perception?"},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"On time, as advertised, and packaged well. No problems at all. Would use again."},{"Title":"The Three Edwards (A History of the Plantagenets) (His A history of the Plantagenets)","review":"The Three Edward's is an okay book. It had good points, clear and descriptive writing, and some good sequences. However, it is no history book! Costain had no degree in history and was not even an antiquarian, far less a historian. He was a journalist who's work on the Plantagenets is classified as \\"historical novels.\\"Costain didn't look at the lives or character of the three Edwards like a historian would. He admired Edward I too much, disliked Edward II too much, and said one thing and then another on Edward III too much. He didn't try to anaylize the men in their times, but judged them for how they would appear in 1958. If this book has any history in it it is false historyThe section on Edward I was good, if your a person who believes everything they hear. When Costain puts it as though Edward had no choice but to become a violent conqueror, he is rubbish. Edward I was too ambitious not to become a violent conqueror. He had no right to Scotland, though Costain makes it seem that way. He just wanted the country.Edward II's section is even worse. Edward is protrayed as a monster of a king, a tyrant devoid of God or love. What about Edward's great piety, or his friendship with Piers Gaveston. It's all protrayed as bad. And that is not what historians do.Edward III's section was the worst of all. When Costain tells us that Edward was a magnificent king, but then states he was unpopular, you could tell who the hippocrit was.This book get's two stars. It was alright, but if you want good history, look somewhere else!"},{"Title":"HONOUR AND VIOLENCE","review":"Anton Blok will open the eyes of the uninitiated, as well as the trained scientist.

If it was like that then I would like my friends better, because it had to do with our age group and kind of based on our life. I really don't know what else to say. Except that it was easy to read.

Mitchell has written a very perceptive volume, commenting on over 100 films (organized alphabetically)and the social issues contained within them as framed by an extensive Introduction (also organized alphabetially) beginning with\\"abortion\\" and ending with \\"women's rights.\\"Each film discussed identifies the social problem under consideration with an overview, synopsis and critique of each film. It is Mitchell's critical overview, acute perception and sense of humor where applicable that makes each entry in this volume a valuable and wonderful piece of film criticism. Especially good is Mitchell's critique of various film noirs and neo-noirs scattered throughout the volume, since he was a specialist in this area of criticism---although he has published widely on other themes such as film music, detective films (Charlie Chan), the horror film, science fiction and even theliterary roots of films based on the novels of H.P. Lovecraft.There is also a huge index and truthfully, this is one of Mitchell's best film books. I would recommend it to fans of cinema as well as all library collections.DedicationIt is unfortunate to note that FILMOGRAPHY OF SOCIAL ISSUES is Charles P. Mitchell's last critical volume. He passed away suddenly in Millinocket, Maine at age 55. Besides writing, Mr. Mitchell was a contributor to CLASSIC IMAGES and was a specialist on film noir (and neo-noir), often tracking down difficult-to-find VHS tapes in this arena, operating a mail-order business called DARKER IMAGES VIDEO in his hometown. He leaves his loving wife Roberta as caretaker of his estate who also intends to continue their video business in Millinocket.Charlie's acute critical perceptions and sense of humor will always be missed personally and in his writings."},{"Title":"Elementary Linear Algebra, Second Edition","review":"I used this in my undergrad course as a math major at UT Dallas. I really enjoyed it; the book has sections on applications in just about every chapter, and there are lots of computational exercises as well. In addition to answers to odd-numbered exercises, each chapter has a &quot;self-test&quot; with all the answers provided at the back of the book. It's a bit chatty, but that befits an undergrad text.This is a good book for self-study, though if you are really serious about it, you might want to supplement it with a more rigorous reference (the Dettman text is good for this)."},{"Title":"Elementary Linear Algebra, Second Edition","review":"I must say I have been pleasantly surprised with this book. I find it very readable. It has been very easy for me to teach myself what I need to know right out of the text. There aren't many math books I've found that can make that claim. I haven't needed to consult any other books to understand the material. The only real improvement I could wish for from this book would be a solutions manual.The book follows a very logical progression. Each topic builds on previously covered material.It's clear to me now why UT chose this book for its math major classes. The emphasis in this book is teaching you to think abstractly and work out difficult proofs, which you're going to need for more advanced math classes. The book has a lot of proof exercises (but there are a lot of computational exercises as well.) In all, I'd say this book does a great job doing what it was designed to do, which is to train future mathematicians. This naturally implies, however, as a previous reviewer stated, that it's going to be short on applications. So if you're going to be taking a class using this book, it would be a good idea to learn a little about the applications of linear algebra before you start, if you need that knowledge to keep yourself motivated. Then prepare to learn linear algebra from a very fine book."},{"Title":"Elementary Linear Algebra, Second Edition","review":"This book is almost impossible to understand. There are no explanations in plain english to allow the reader some sort of real world association of the concepts that it tries to explain. If you are already a math professor, and understand linear algebra, buy it. If you are a student who is trying learn it for the first time you'll end up spending most of your time trying to figure out how all this stuff relates to the real world. There is no solutions manual available, and the solutions to problems in the back of the book are completely useless.

Every one had a different favorite. Lowit says that when she used to hang out with Andy Warhol he turned to her one evening and said, Roxanne, you taught me something valuable about photography. She was surprised and asked him what she could possibly have taught Warhol? Impishly he pointed to her two cameras. Always have one black and white, and one color camera he replied. That's what she had taught him.The photos in PEOPLE reflect this ambidextrousness. Some, the more classical Richard Avedon sort of photos, are severe, glamorous, almost austere, like nuns, in their devotion to the image. I think I wound up like the color photos more however, which show a different side to her genius, the Fellini side, the side that believes and partakes in magic ritual. Lowit's best work participates in a Bakhtinian carnival existence, constantly flirting with disaster, always ominously present when the great wheels of existence begin to cantilever sideways. Take a look at her somber portrait of a wasted Norman Mailer--the sage gone mad.For the record if she were to appear in San Francisco like a fairy godmother and grant me one request, that I could own a print of any of the photos in PEOPLE, I would still be torn. I want the double-page layout of the original Spice Girls from the 1990s. On the other hand there's a wonderful, scarlet tinged double portrait of a youngish Liza Minnelli together with a rough, aged Audrey Hepburn that is just beautiful.

He focuses on the difficulty of identifying ancient migratory cultures, especially in light of Greek and Roman assumptions that these peoples were static and mainly defined them in terms of place rather than as moving groups (identifying them them as 'Germani' because they lived in Germany, for instance). Further, the Romans and Greeks had their own agendas in writing about the peoples of temperate Europe. Archaeology has further muddied the waters by ascribing \\"Celtic\\", \\"Germanic\\" and \\"Scythian\\", \\"Greek\\" and \\"Roman\\" labels to various artifacts and artistic styles.Unfortunately, it is a very brief text and more illustrations would have been helpful. Wells raises many questions and we have to wait for the future research will give us some of the answers."},{"Title":"Beyond Celts, Germans and Scythians: Archaeology and Identity in Iron Age Europe (Duckworth Debates in Archaeology) (Duckworth Debates in Archaeology)","review":"After reading the reviews on this book, I ordered it with great excitement.It seems obvious that the boundaries of the ancient Iron Age people were most likely to be somewhat fluid, and this book - I was hoping - might shine some more light on some blank spots of current knowledge.One example I was hoping would be cleared up is the names of \\"Germanic\\" tribes - such as the Germani, Cimbri, and Teutones, which are either most probably Celtic tribal names in the case of Germani and Teutones, and a disputed Germanic tribal name in the case of the name Cimbri. Another anomaly is that the leaders of Cimbri and the Teutones apparently had Celtic names and they allied themselves with Celtic tribes.However this book took an interesting idea and pretty much did nothing with it.It did more or less stick to \\"new wave\\" archaeological paradigms - for example - diffusion of all things up until historical records and then suddenly (because its hard to force history to fit diffusion models) everyone is invading everyone else.The book pretty much ignored post classical historical and linguistic evidence.Many disparate pieces of evidence come together to fill in our picture of the Celts (by Celts I mean any group of people who spoke a Celtic language). There is far more evidence to suggest that the Romans and the Greek writers actually got it right most of the time, and it seems very unlikely that they would have consistently misrepresented not only the tribal names of the Celts they met, but also the actual personal names, and somehow do this in a way that the tribal and personal names are most often recognizably linguistically Celtic (cognates with modern Celtic languages etc).There is pretty much a smooth transition from currently (i.e. that Wells takes issue with) standard accepted Celtic European prehistory to undisputed history. Roman and Greek writings, Celtic toponyms, historical peoples such as the Galatae in Turkey, Galicia, Asturias etc in Spain, the Gallo Romans in France, the insular Celts, the Roman settlement of what is now Switzerland and many, many other sources, all provide a fairly clear picture of prehistoric Celtic Europe. However, Wells, refering most of the time to classical writers, and without any real evidence, says that our picture of prehistoric Celtic Europe is (in important ways) wrong.An example of where Wells ignores any other evidence is when he throws doubt on the idea that a Celtic group sacked the Delphi (as did many other groups, who were not Celtic). And yet somehow the writers at the time recorded these invaders as having Celtic names (e.g. not Germanic, Scythian, Illyrian or Thracian). Many Celts were also present on the borders of Macedonia in Dacia etc, thus we know they were close enough to do it. And we know historically that some portion of them settled in Turkey. Many pieces of complimentary evidence (such as Turkish history) suggest to us that this is the most likely scenario. Saying the words \\"Greek writers never defined what Celtic means\\" and \\"it is most likely that with that term they meant simply soldiers from western and central Europe\\" are not worthy pieces of evidence that can change our mind of the above scenario.In summary I kept looking for the \\"beef\\" in this book, but most of the time was met with vague mumblings about how the classical writers \\"could\\" have been wrong, and \\"may\\" have misrepresented some peoples. There were also some strange theories that reminded me a bit of heisenberg's uncertainty theorem. That the tribes (like the Helvetti and the Sequani, and by extension I guess he means all of the historical tribes the rest of Europe and in Britain like the Iceni etc) did not actually have these tribal identities until Roman interaction forced these identities upon them. That's funny, the Roman's never got to Ireland and yet somehow these Celtic people had tribal identities too (so did the peoples of Sweden, well away from Roman influence). I can imagine a mercenary warrior coming home to the hearth and saying to the chieftain: \\"By the way - we are actually the Fir Domnann!\\", and the chief replies with \\"Good idea! And lets call the people in the next valley the Fir Bolg!\\". \\"Too late chief, Fergus just got back from the continent and he has already given them the name the Gaili'in\\".Anyway my suggestion, if you are still interested in this book and want to make up your own mind, is to borrow it from a library."},{"Title":"Beyond Celts, Germans and Scythians: Archaeology and Identity in Iron Age Europe (Duckworth Debates in Archaeology) (Duckworth Debates in Archaeology)","review":"In Beyond Celts, Germans, And Scythians: Archaeology And Identity In Iron Age Europe, Peter Wells surveys these Iron Age peoples of Europe and explores the rich archaeological evidence they left behind.

Beyond Celts, Germans, And Scythians draws upon recent theoretical and methodological advances in anthropology, archaeology and history from sources all over Europe and bases a new approach to the problem of the identities of Iron Age peoples. What is revealed is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of dynamic and diverse cultural identities.

W. StandifordPublisher: 1stBooksISBN: 1-4033-9523-3From the Valley of the Shadow... by Bob GrayI've spent the last thirty-five years avoiding books and movies about Vietnam. The few I was exposed to infuriated me for their absolute refusal to see any good in what we did, or to appreciate the sacrifice our soldiers made. It never mattered to me who ran the country, nor did I buy into the Domino Theory - a McNamara creation that proved to be, like the man, a lie. What mattered to me were the American lives lost in a half-hearted pursuit of - not victory - peace. Then I discovered the book by Wayne Standiford; Bury Me With Soldiers.This is the story of how one average guy - average size, average intelligence, average outlook, life, and concerns - grew up and grew old in a few months of combat. The hopeless numbness that sets in after days of going from boredom to terror in one word - \\"incoming!\\" - is chilling in it's dissection of warfare on the human spirit. We watch as a callus grows over the author's heart, and his soul goes into remission to await the all-clear siren. And mail call.We meet Standiford as a high school senior. A friend of his who had graduated the year before dies in Vietnam. From the universal frustrations of high school (the drudgery of studying subjects you know you'll never use, to sex - and the lack thereof) to the middle-class values still prevalent but losing ground in the 1960's, author Standiford's life and choices mirror the particulars of millions of men caught on one side or another of the Vietnam war dilemma.Beset by the normal doubts and aspirations of any American teenager, he stands at his personal crossroads and wonders aloud what to do. The sixties were, as has been described by an endless array of social scientists, a disaffecting time for those of us then reaching adulthood. The old parameters of \\"America, Mom, and Apple Pie\\" were no longer enough. Not merely not enough - they were openly ridiculed. Jingoism was often the appellation applied. Bedrock beliefs were overturned with nothing to replace them. As someone else wrote about that period, America was ripe for a dictator. Free love played into the hands of every teenage boy who wanted to get laid more than anything else on earth. The beckoning hedonism was hard to resist.But some did. In a seamless progression Standiford shows us that some took seriously the idea that America was worth fighting for - even if the reasoning behind the fight might be flawed. The author was such a man. Standiford joined the Marines, went through Recon training and scuba diving school, and set off to destroy the enemy to the best of his ability. He did so without reservation. Then.In a recent email from Mr. Standiford, he told me the following: \\"I wouldn't take a million dollars for the experience - and I wouldn't do it over again for two million.\\" Besides dating him (when a million dollars was big money), the statement describes my own attitude and that of most of the vets I know.The story he tells called up memories without being predictable. Several times the unexpected sentence made me laugh out loud - a tough row to hoe when discussing mortar round-amputated limbs and burned bodies. And the honesty of this work is mesmerizing. Standiford's early loss of heart and how he dealt with it tells us what we need most desperately to know about any author: Can I trust his word? We find that, indeed, we must. No one would admit to the things he does and lie about lesser things.His description of real people, men whose names should be engraved on our hearts, is riveting. The men with whom he served, Meatball, Tut, Ernie, Mac, and Doc, will always be a part of Wayne Standiford. The pain of seeing a friend lose an arm, a leg, life; the exhilaration of returning from the bush as a whole person one more time; the devastation experienced when the fickle love back home sends a Dear John letter; the unreasoning fear that becomes commonplace while sitting in a hole in the ground half-filled with water as mortar rounds creep ever closer; these too will always be a part of him. They become a part of us when we read his story.The acceptance of the simple but horrific fact that man-hunting is suddenly legal can be discouraging (which means, literally, to lose one's courage). That so many American boys became men while undergoing this terrifying experience says much for this country and the values we continue to hold dear. That they did it despite attempts, by those Americans who hate America, to convince them they were all criminals for being there says much for the integrity and courage of the individual men. To this day the prevalent notion (and an awful lie) that all our military men came back junkies and killers continues to blacken the sacrifice they made.So to all those men and women who survived and those who died trying to save a tiny country from the communist dictatorship that eventually did engulf and murder those with the temerity to stand against the Stalinist horde - I've never had the opportunity to say this before: Thank you.That our faint-hearted politicians wasted your efforts, and many of your lives, does not reflect badly upon you - only on them. You stood up when your country asked you to. And I appreciate it, even if I prove to be the only one. You hear the complaint repeated endlessly nowadays: Where are our heroes? The answer is that they are all around us - many of us just don't want to admit it.And my most profound thanks to Wayne Standiford for sharing his story with me and all who care to know what really happened there. If I can't occupy the plot next to yours, then I ask the same thing you do: please, Bury Me with Soldiers."},{"Title":"Bury Me with Soldiers","review":"As the editor and publisher of our county newspaper, I must read a great deal, and have gotten very particular about what I really enjoy reading- and I LOVED this book.With a son in the military, three brothers who served in the military in the Vietnam era, and with a Dad who served in WWII, I have never really known what they faced, what they struggled with, and what a shock it must have been to be taken from \\"Hometown\\" to defending our country halfway around the world. The author skillfully walks us through his time in 'Nam, and I feel I've gotten a glimpse of thoughts and feelings, fears and emotions, that I could never have gotten otherwise.I sent the book to my son and his wife, and they both love it also- (and my daughter-in-law finished it before my son!) We have compared notes, and decided we truly LOVE the way this author writes. I intend to check and see if Mr. Standiford has written other books, because if he has, I'm sold.I've purchased books before, dug into them, and then struggled to even WANT to finish them because I was disappointed in the quality, and didn't feel the author delivered what he promised. Standiford delivers MORE than he promises- I was never disappointed and I found myself arranging my schedule so I could hurry up and get back to the book!In short- this is a great book."},{"Title":"Bury Me with Soldiers","review":"C. Wayne Standiford's memoir, originally released as \\"Crucible 0311\\" misses nothing about the Viet Nam War, i.e. the attitude of the grunts, the anti-war movement, and the King assassination. It's a serious, comprehensive history lesson of what really went on in Vietnam, with facts that most history books will rarely touch! Standiford initially served in \\"Lima Company\\", 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, in Dong Ha, I Corps, in the northernmost part of South Vietnam, by the DMZ. He eventually transferred out to a reconnaissance unit, with bases at Quang Tri, Phu Bai and Khe Sanh. He conducted 27 reconnaissance missions deep into enemy V.C. and N.V.A. territory.Very Crazy, G.I.!: Strange but True Stories of the Vietnam WarAlthough Standford's unit was lightly armed, their functions were to gather intelligence, locate, capture and destroy weapons, caches of rice, ammunition, documents, and attempt prisoner snatches for interrogation. Standiford gives highlights of his most memorable missions, vividly describing dangerous insertions and extractions that resulted in his unit being credited with 606 confirmed killed.However, there is much more to this memoir then simple military tactics, missions, shooting and death. Standiford ironically sets the tone right in the beginning of this story, when he mentions that he was having coffee with his younger brother 15 years after the war was over, and with absolutely no warning, his brother said: \\"I never did thank you for going to Vietnam. I want to thank you now\\". I am not going to be a plot-spoiler and reveal the details of Standifords missions. You'll just have to find this book. What I am going to write about, is some iota the author mentions that is rarely seen in other biographies and memoirs of this war.Standiford volunteered for the Marine Corps in 1966 right after graduating high school and deciding that he didn't want to go to college. Vietnam was a hot issue in the early 1960's. Standiford prefaced his story with a quote from L.B.J., which turned out to be anything from the truth: \\"We are not about to send American boys nine or 10,000 miles away from home, to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves\\".Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973Standiford angrily asserted that: \\"L.B.J. did not want to overthrow the government of North Vietnam. This basic philosophy, I believe, caused the war to drag on and cause the loss of many lives.\\" Standiford was very confused. He saw conflicting bumber stickers of \\"America:Love it or Leave it\\", \\"Hell No, We Won't Go\\", and \\"Make Love, Not War.\\"Standiford's anger is vented throughout the book. He mentions that when he watched in 1975 the news of panic stricken Vietnamese fleeing the Communist North's final invasion, with images of U.S. choppers being pushed off the decks of carriers to make room for fleeing citizens, he went into his bedroom to cry.The Fall of Saigon (We the People)Standiford lamented: \\"Honest to God, I tried to cry, but all I could do was produce some mist in my eyes. My pump did a half stroke, but the well would not flush the soul. I could not believe we had lost the war\\". To that effect, he continues elsewhere in the book his bitterness of unfinished business. Standiford asserts: \\"It was the only protracted war that saw this country flounder pitifully. With that failure, the fabric of this nation was immutably altered.Cyclops in the Jungle: A One-Eyed LRP in Vietnam (Stackpole Military History Series)The innocent blood flowing through our teenage veins would never be the same. We had gone to stem the tide of communism to fight an honorable fight. As the war protracted, our music died. The honor of this nation suffered a near fatal blow. Gone forever was our youth. For those of us who went, the Vietnam War will go with us to our graves. It will go as a task not completed.\\"Standiford voices his opinion on other aspects of this war rarely discussed elsewhere. In terms of the media's portrayal of the Vietnam Vet in their productions of the 3 post Vietnam War movies, e.g. \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Platoon\\" and \\"The Deer Hunter\\", Standiford angrily dismisses all these as showing the Vietnam Vet as a demented, \\"wigged out\\" killer.Platoon (Special Edition)He angrily fires back: \\"What I saw was an entirely different war. In the 2 units I served with there, there was no dishonor. We never burned a village or mistreated a prisoner. Drugs were taboo, men fought to survive and to help their friends to survive. Time after time honor and self-sacrifice saved the day\\". He illustrates this in 2 paradigms.The Killing Zone: My Life in the Vietnam WarOne of Standiford's recon teams ran into a large NVA force. They called for an emergency extraction. If the choppers didn't arrive immediately, all team members would be surrounded and killed.An Army Huey, with a \\"new pilot\\" (F.N.G.) dropped in to do the extraction of the trapped and surrounded Recon team, amongst heavy enemy fire. The door gunner cranked out heavy lead flying from his M-60 machine gun at the enemy. All team members dived in to the chopper, except the radioman, who following normal procedures, was always the last to climb aboard. The pilot lifted the chopper off without him inside. Seeing that the chopper was lifting off without him, the radioman dove for the skids of the Huey, holding a death grip on them as the bird climbed out of the hot zone. Team members yelled at the chopper pilot to set back down to let the radioman in, which was ignored. As the Huey continued it's ascent, a rope was dropped to the radioman, but between the G forces, the prop wash and air currents, the rope was kept out of his reach. The radioman lost his grip, tumbled to his death, and his body was later found impaled in the trees. He died alone as the chopper continued back to base without him. Team members almost killed the pilot after it landed.Standiford tells of a similar incident with this team a week later where a different Huey pilot tried to take off on an extraction from a hot landing zone without all team members on board.1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diaryThis time, team members put a .45 pistol to the head of the pilot, and no vertical movement of the chopper allowed until all team members were on board. Towards the end of his tour, Standiford had multiple missions in the \\"A-Shau Valley\\", one of the most hotly contested areas of the Vietnam War.Death in the a Shau Valley: L Company LRRPs in Vietnam, 1969-1970No matter how many of the enemy's forces were killed, it seemed it made no impact on a conclusive U.S. victory. Standiford remarks: \\"It appeared no matter how many missions we went on, no matter how many NVA our little bands spotted or killed, we still paid a heavy price for snooping around in Charlie country. The war seemed to drag on with no thrusts to end the carnage.\\"Another interesting point you will find in this memoir is the impact Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination on April 14, 1968 had on the effect of troop morale. Coming just two months after the \\"Tet Offense\\" debacle, Standiford wrote: \\"It was never said in the open, but I believe every white man in the states, and maybe even here, was held responsible for Dr. King's death\\".A Bad Attitude: A novel from the Vietnam WarWhen Standiford finally D.E.R.O.S'ed back to the U.S. (his tour ended, returning back to the States) he wrote: \\"The mind dug a hole and pulled the lid over all the senses concerning Vietnam. I talked to no one about Vietnam, and no one talked to me. It never really happened.\\" This is common in other memoirs, particularly where upon returning, a Vet would immediately shed his uniform to try to blend in without attracting attention.ChickenhawkI am leaving out many other stories of this tremendous memoir, but I will relate one last tale that Standiford leaves the reader with. In 1995, his son, Cody announced to Standiford that he joined the Navy to become a \\"S.E.A.L.\\" Standiford immediately talked him out of it, with his son settling for a less than honorable discharge. Feeling that Clinton would neither be willing to send his own sons or daughters to battle, nor willing to spend his own blood, Standiford did not want his children in the nation's military with Clinton at the helm. Standiford defended his position by explaining his anger at Clinton for \\"wiggling out\\" of the draft, Clinton's defense of his drug use, claiming that when smoking marijuana, he supposedly \\"did not inhale\\", Clinton's employment by the \\"World Peace Organization, and the issue of Clinton's infidelity towards his wife with his indiscretion with Monica Lowenski.Standiford's final comment, when voicing his opinion as to why Vietnam Vets have such a high incidence of suicide, is as follows: \\"It is this veteran's belief that these incidents were probably a direct result of these men coming home to a nation that held no esteem, or gratitude, for their offering. \\"Bury Me With Soldiers\\" is an exceptionally powerful Vietnam memoir, teaching the reader and student of this conflict nuances rarely expressed elsewhere. This memoir needs to be redistributed, placed in all high school and college American History curriculum's, inculcating without either the warping of time nor Hollywood's version of what really happened in the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Bury Me with Soldiers","review":"Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I know a number of people who served in Vietnam but never talk about it. I found this book to be a real eye-opener. It's a very candid, honest and often humorous account of Vietnam. It made me proud of our soldiers and ashamed of the way we treated them and welcomed them home. As a mother of a recently returned Navy Corpsman who served with the Marines in Iraq, this book made me even more determined to make sure our soldiers are taken care of, no matter how we feel about the war or the president.Loved the book and highly recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"Bury Me with Soldiers","review":"I read an awful lot of books about the Vietnam war and those who survived it- I have my own little library in fact. Some books are good, some are not so good. Some are filled with so much tactical jargon or language that an average person cannot even get through to decide if they like the book!Some just sounds like one person pounding their chest real hard!This is not one of those books. It is hands down one of the best books I have ever read on any subject. I am not sure I can explain why his words touched me so. But I think it is because he wrote not from a researcher's point of view, but a survivors point of view. Not from second hand- but from his own memories, his own heart, sadness, joys, anger, hate and sometimes humor. You can't make that up. No matter your talent, you were either there, or you were not and people know the difference. He is the real McCoy.When I read his book it felt like he was sitting right there in my living room- as if he was my old friend come back from a long stay away from my home. And he sat there in my oldest most comfortable chair, kicked off his shoes and told me about everything that had happened since last we met. Some of his story made me laugh so hard I couldn't not stop- like when he got to boot camp. There were times when I thought my heart would break, and there were times, like when I closed that book, that I wondered how in the world did any man or woman ever survive that war, not just physically, but mentally, spiritually- for that, he is my hero. Yes he did some powerful things as a soldier no question, he was decorated for that more than once. But more than that, he is my hero because he wrote personally about things that we all need to read if we will ever, ever begin to understand how Vietnam was different for our soldiers. It is not easy to put everything you own personally in your heart on paper for other people to dissect. He is brave and I think this book should be read by every American."},{"Title":"The Empty Land (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"At first Matt Coburn is reluctant to do just that, to clean up the town of Confusion, Utah, a boom town over-run by the most dangerous men, every kind of gunman, drygulcher, outlaw, tin horn, and murderer. But he knows that no one else is up to the task, most of the town people believe that there must be another way to clean up the town without killings. Laurie Shannon is one of these people, a ranch owner, who is attracted to Matt yet doesn't want him to get involved. But there are others who knows that if the killers in the town aren't killed, more innocent people will be killed. Madge Healy is one of these people, who is being hunted down by Willard &amp; Kingsbury who want her claims and would even have a woman killed to have it. Matt must make up his mind whether to forget about the whole matter and just leave, or to make Confusion into a good town.&quot;The Empty Land&quot; is a great book. Where as most of Louis L'Amour's books it was easy to guess which girl the main character was going to get, but I couldn't figure out if Matt was going to love Laurie or Madge. But you'll have to read the book yourself to find out. I also love the book how it explains like most of L'Amour's book that the main character is always at the same time doesn't want to kill anyone, he always knows when it is necessary to stop the bad guys.For those people who want to start reading Louis L'Amour books, I suggest you read the Sackett series which I think are the best of Louis L'Amour, besides also &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Empty Land (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Action packed book depicting the taming of a murderous wild west mining town by a gunfighter.

Guareschi wrote a number of other successful books, including a series of Don Camillo books, but I don't know how many of them were translated into English.

Here father Camillo finagles his way onto a communist-sponsored trip to the Soviet Union and sets upon frustrating/annoying Peppone--all to allow the Italian comrades on the trip to see the light. There is even a quite touching episode concerning an Italian and his Polish wife stuck in rural Soviet Union. Setting part of it in the Soviet Union allowed Guareshi to take the gloves off againts communism at another point--although never in a way that detracted from his humor.I was thinking of giving it four stars.

Each of the fourteen writers dealt with a different issue in the practice of pastoral ministry which he considers broken. In so doing, they hoped to provide what each of them views as a necessary corrective to restore pastoral ministry to its biblical and historical roots. Some of the contributors provide helpful reflections. Others used their respective missives as an opportunity to ride gallantly upon their theological hobbyhorses intending to find brokenness where perhaps none exists, or at least not to the extent they believe exists.Helpful ReflectionsJoel Beeke's chapter, \\"The Utter Necessity of a Godly Life,\\" gives a pointed reminder to pastors that their lives must be lived above reproach. Much of the chapter seems elementary at its best and patronizing at its worst; but it does serve as a not-so-subtle rebuke to the minister whose life reflects more of this world than of the next world. Beeke reminds pastors that their congregations can never rise above the depth of their own spirituality. Pastors must always be one step ahead in the never-ending quest for godliness. It is easy for the busy pastor to substitute the duties of the job for devotion to the Savior, such as using sermon preparation as a substitute for devotional meditation. I have fallen into this trap, especially while under the time pressures common to many bi-vocational pastors. Now as a \\"fully supported,\\" pastor, I realize that the giftedness of my ministry must be authenticated by the fruitfulness of my character and conduct borne out of a passionate love relationship with Jesus. My people will never see Jesus reflected in my life if I neglect spending time in the Tent of Meeting.Thomas Smith's chapter entitled, \\"Keeping the Main Thing the Main Thing,\\" is a wonderful polemic for the centrality of Christ in preaching. Just as the apostolic kerygma maintained the centrality of Christ and the cross, all modern preaching must strive to bring people to Christ. Without Jesus, there is no good news. Without the preaching of the cross, there is no hope for spiritual health and wholeness. All our exegesis must pass through a Christological filter to ensure sound hermeneutics. The apex of Christian preaching must remain the glory of God through the exaltation of Christ.Jerry Marcellino deals with the important issue of the glory of God in worship. One must not design a worship services for the pleasure of the people. Worship belongs to God. The object of worship is never the feelings of the worshipper, but the exaltation of the One worshipped. Worship must reflect God's grandeur, his transcendence, and his mystery. While many of Marcellion's points regarding worship are well taken, his treatment of what constitutes acceptable worship music lacks the necessary specificity to be helpful and is sufficiently vague to be harmful. While some worship music seems to transcend time and culture, every generation must be free to offer praise and adoration in the vernacular of its musical culture. Much of the denigration directed at contemporary praise and worship music reflects the aesthetic values of the detractors rather than specific biblical injunctions. Modern day Luthers and Calvins must be allowed to transform the popular music of the day into melodious praise meaningful to the contemporary worshipper. Let history sort out what works and what does not work."},{"Title":"Reforming Pastoral Ministry: Challenges for Ministry in Postmodern Times","review":"I haven't finished it yet but it has been a real blessing to me personally and a great help to my Ministry I even bought a copy for a friend because I knew she would love it."},{"Title":"Awaken from the Dream","review":"AWAKEN FROM THE DREAM is co-authored by Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick, the founders of the Foundation for A Course In Miracles -- [...]. (A COURSE IN MIRACLES, for those unfamiliar, is a three-volume self-study book about spiritual psychotherapy.) The Course teaches that this physical universe is ultimately an illusion - an illusion not created by God but made by the ego as an attack on God. The Course says that we believe we entered into this physical universe after \\"the separation from God.\\"The separation described in A COURSE IN MIRACLES could be roughly seen as akin to the downfall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Though in Course theory the original state of communication with God is purely abstract and non-dual. In the original state our individual identities did not exist and God did not perceive us as separate from Himself.) Unlike the Bible, the Course does not have a myth to dramatize its version of the downfall. AWAKEN FROM THE DREAM present such a myth, based on the psychic and auditory experiences of Gloria Wapnick - experiences that helped her better understand this aspect of Course theory.This is not an easy aspect of Course theory (as if there is any aspect of the Course that is easy). And, by the way, the Course says that ultimately the separation from God never even occurred. We merely believe it has occurred, and the physical world with all its multiplicity of problems arose in our minds to block against our belief in the separation. In reality, we only have one problem: this belief in the separation.

Problem is they take a long time to master, but the pay off is much greater."},{"Title":"Life of the Drama","review":"This book came out of a series of lectures on drama that Bentley gave at Harvard in 60/61.It's broken down thusly -Part I - Aspects of a Play1. Plot2. Character3. Dialogue4. Thought5. EnactmentPart II - Different Kinds of Plays6. Melodrama7. Farce8. Tragedy9. Comedy10. TragicomedyFor each section Bentley uses a number and variety of examples, from the Greeks up to Brecht.The book can be thought of as asking two questions - Why do we like drama? What makes for good drama?Amongst the many answers -We like to see an imitation of life.We like the companionship, of the players and fellow audience members.It's interesting to see other peoples take on the world and life.Bentley presents some big ideas but at the same time it was a fun read. He's got some strong opinions but he makes good cases for them. Virtually every page had something that made me think. The overall tone is that of an intelligent man talking frankly and directly with someone he considers equally intelligent.He's erudite, anti-pedantic, and controversial (maybe counter-intuitive is a better term).Here's an example of Bentley's erudition, from page 348 of the paperback -\\"At the end of Balzac's play Mercadet, a certain Godeau arrives with money to solve everyone's problems; and at the end of Beckett's play the God of the Old or the New Testament could arrive to solve everyone's problems. That would be a happy ending indeed. That \\"Godot\\" does not come is what makes the play a parable of life as seen by modern man.\\"Here's some controversial/counter-intuitive stuff:\\"The head office of all the education systems in the world is in Madison avenue.\\" pg 349.\\"In Praise of Self-Pity\\" - section in Melodrama chapter.\\"In Praise of Types\\" - section in Character chapter.\\"Without violence, there would be nothing in the world but goodness, and literature is not mainly about goodness: it is mainly about badness.\\" page 221.In sum, this is a very accomplished book about drama that is highly readable and offers a banquet of food for thought."},{"Title":"Life of the Drama","review":"This is a graceful, thorough, humane journey through the territory of plot, story, and what makes a drama compelling.

Here we have the history of wreaths, symbology, how to make wreaths, detailed explanations of the tremendous variety of natural ingredients that can be used in making wreaths and the reasons for choosing each. And much, much more, including hundreds of black-and-white illustrationsThis book is published by a small company that makes and sells wreaths but fortunately that does not mean this book has succumbed to being simply a self-serving promotion tool. This book is clearly produced by people who truly love and cherish the craft of wreath making in its most profound sense and wish to share the love, appreciation and know-how with the world.The book has a self-published look and some people might wish there were color photos or color illustrations, but nevertheless, it is hard to imagine anyone who is into wreaths not considering this book to be a \\"must-have.\\""},{"Title":"Winning the Money Game","review":"In the mid-70s, I produced and recorded a two-day conference for entrepreneurs featuring numerous experts including bankers, accountants, venture capitalists, marketing consultants, successful business owners, etc. as speakers.

I now make my living as an author-editor and needed a copy of WTMG to send to a prospective client for whom I propose to perform the same service since he recently produced a multi-speaker conference.

Don Dible"},{"Title":"Building Your Dream Horse: Charles Wilhelm's Ultimate Foundation Training (Howell Equestrian Library)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I love Charles Wilhelm, I love his shows and he has taught me a lot just by watching him. I love his manner, his way of putting things across... and the fact that his step-by-step exercises work.However, as he would admit, he is not a writer. This book is written by the co-author, and it shows. There's nothing in the book that's 'wrong', it's just that it lacks passion - it's kind of uninspired. I get the feeling that they set out to write 'yet another horse training book' and included all the necessary sections, and all in all it reads like that.It's also fairly thin on content. For example, if you watch CW ride, his horses have really good flexibility and shoulder control. This is what I'm working towards with my 3 yr old. I find the section in the book .... and there's at most a paragraph ... ! Just not enough to really work from. Not enough specific exercises to even get you started.I'm not really sure who the book is aimed at. Not for a beginning trainer like me. For starting to train your horse, you're much better off with Clinton Anderson's Downunder Horsemanship. The training methods are pretty much the same, but CA's gives you a whole lot more value for money - much clearer instruction, much more specific exercises, far better illustrated (you can really see what you're trying to achieve and how from the CA photo's).I'm sorry I didn't like the book more. I'm still a big fan of the man and the method."},{"Title":"Building Your Dream Horse: Charles Wilhelm's Ultimate Foundation Training (Howell Equestrian Library)","review":"This is a very solid new training book that came out shortly after Clinton Anderson's Downunder Horsemanship. There are a many similarities in the two trainers' approaches, including:* every encounter with a horse includes training* extensive groundwork is key to success under saddle* exercises on the lunge line emphasized more than pure round pen work* endless flexion exercises are important to condition a horse to respond to very light rein pressure* one-rein stop is key to safe riding; how to train for it.Wilhelm has good advice on buying a horse, complete with a sample sales agreement. There is some very good stuff in the pages he devotes to problem solving. He deals with the usual issues of bucking, rearing, trailer loading, etc. I especially appreciated his description of how to use a tie ring to cure horses from pulling back when tied, and the exercises to overcome buddy sour behavior.One area where I can't fairly rate Wilhelm is his clarity and thoroughness in describing his foundation techniques. I bought Anderson's book after seeing him at a horse expo, so his book made sense to me immediately. Since then I've viewed Anderson's Riding with Confidence video series -- easily the most helpful and well-produced of any training series I've seen. So I recognize I'm handicapped in comparing the books fairly, but there were a number of times I didn't feel I was quite grasping Wilhem's approach, especially in applying the techniques over an extended period of time.Certainly Anderson's book is a better bargain by the pound. Both list for $24.99, but Downunder Horsemanship is almost twice the size, and filled with huge beautiful color photographs.Wilhelm has a three paragraph rant about trainers \\"selling the benefits of their magical equipment.\\" I've never heard a trainer do that, and I was amused when I went to Wilhem's web site to see that he has his own large inventory of products for sale, including the tie ring that is essential to his technique for curing pullback. In my experience, most of the stuff these guys sell is good quality and fairly priced, and they don't need to be so defensive about it.The bottom line for me is that Building Your Dream Horse is a fine book, but Downunder Horsemanship is better. Either one would be more useful in combination with seeing the authors in person or viewing their videos.Edit, 8/14/2008Three years is a long time, and I've had a chance to use a lot of different techniques on a lot of different horses since I last read this book, so I reread it last week.I was given a little 14 year old gelding, very quiet, friendly, calm and generally well mannered. But his reaction to pressure is to freeze and try to wait it out. One thing I really need to change is his resistance to rein pressure. Pull on a rein and he goes merrily on in the direction of his choice, not yours.Pulling harder didn't help, and I didn't want to start jerking on his head, so I was stuck. Then I got to Wilhelm's chapter about flexing exercises. He described the most pressure resistant horse he ever trained. The first time he tried getting that horse to flex his neck he waited an hour and twenty minutes for the horse to give the first time!I was waiting more like a minute. So, inspired by Wilhelm's example, I went out and tried again, this time maintaining steady pressure and ready to wait it out. After a few minutes, the little guy tipped his nose in toward me and I dropped the rein. On the second try he tipped in within a few seconds. The third time he responded instantly.All of which is a long story to make a simple point, which is that Wilhelm has a lot of good examples in this book that might be just what you need to solve a problem. Building Your Dream Horse is not as complete as Downunder Horsemanship, but the information it presents is very solid."},{"Title":"Building Your Dream Horse: Charles Wilhelm's Ultimate Foundation Training (Howell Equestrian Library)","review":"Have seen Wilhelm at the Horse Expo a couple of times now and really enjoyed the demonstrations. Got the book somewhat reluctantly, most of these are SO dry and hard to follow, but this one really works. Easy to understand and written with nice stories and examples. Really enjoyed the pictures too - so many books are just pictures of the trainer - nice to see the focus be on the people who own horses rather than someone's ego. Anyway - great book - just straightforward approach to foundation training that should work for pretty much anyway. I was happy to have been wrong about what I was expecting. Nice job guy!"},{"Title":"Building Your Dream Horse: Charles Wilhelm's Ultimate Foundation Training (Howell Equestrian Library)","review":"I was looking for a step-by-step method for training a young horse, and this isn't it. Mr. Wilhelm describes his round pen or leadline methods for starting and stopping the horse's feet, and then suddenly we are in the saddle teaching the horse to give to the bit, with no explanation of how we got up there!My dream horse might automatically understand about carrying a saddle and having a rider on board without being systematically taught about those things, but I sure don't want to count on it.There's a lot of useful information in this book, I'm not going to toss it out, but I'll need to look elsewhere for a system of foundation training."},{"Title":"Building Your Dream Horse: Charles Wilhelm's Ultimate Foundation Training (Howell Equestrian Library)","review":"Thank you so much for writing such a great book!

Finally - here it is! This is the perfect introduction into understanding horses and horsemanship. And frankly - I've been a trainer for 35 years, think I am very good at it, and I really liked it too. Great no-nonsense stuff, exercises that people can understand - no fancy language, and a jolly good read. Nice not to be bored to tears reading a training book for a change. I've never seen Charles Wilhelm in person, but I will take a group of my clients next time he's in Maryland!

Hobhouse is considered by many to be one of the world's foremost garden experts and her contribution to the book is undoubtedly the selection. Penelope won't send you to a garden not worth seeing.The stated purpose of the book according to Hobhouse is to introduce the reader to the most important gardens in Europe and to provide a representative picture of the distinctive horticultural traditions of the countries included. The gardens Hobhouse includes are open to the public, but in some cases arrangements must be made ahead of time if you intend to visit them. Hobhouse lists several of my favorites, including Sissinghurst and the University Botanical Gardens at Oxford. I've spent many a happy moment sitting on a bench in the botanical gardens. Some days you can look across the Thames (which is very narrow here) and see a Cricket match.Although the book is about 10 years old and some of the information is dated (admission charges), it lists 700 gardens open to the public in both Western and Eastern Europe. At the time of it's printing, many of those in Eastern Europe had just opened to Westerners. Undoubtedly, you will want to verify a garden of interest to you is still open to the public.The book is filled with color as well as black and white photos, and useful maps. You won't want to carry the book on your trip as it's heavy, but if you're looking for more information about a particular area or garden you can use this book to supplement the information in your Blue Book, Michelin Guide or Baedecker."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"An amazing story which should should leave any reader with a new respect of what man can overcome when his will to survive is unquestioned."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I read this book years ago but could never remember the title.

You'll want to read it again a few years down the road."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Jan Baalsrud was the only survivor of a botched sabotoge mission in Norway during the Second World War. His almost unbelievable story of escape and survival is recounted here. Jan's story is amazing and a tribute to the many Norwegians who risked their own lives to assist him. I debated between a 3-star and a 4-star rating here and settled on the 3-star due mainly to the fact that the mission itself was a complete failure, betrayed at the start, and because the ending is somewhat anti-climactic."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Jan Baalsrud's escape from Nazi controlled Norway is truly one of the most incredible real-life story from a bygone era. I, too, could not put down the book once I started it.There are already numerous accolades for this book here, so I will not repeat familiar praises other than to say that it will be one of the best book on anyone's shelf. There is just one minor complaint: This 1955 book has not a single map in it! The whole story is about Baalsrud's improbably journey through the inhospitable landscape of Arctic Norway. He was assisted by hundred of his compatriots and stayed in houses after houses to evade the German troops. Without a map, those Norwegian towns and villages tend to blur into each others and some of the psychological impact from the story get lost in the confusion.A Google search turns up a map of his journey online, but even here the information is not accurate. For example, his second stop, the island of Hersoy, was skipped altogether. I spent some time with Google Earth and got a much better appreciation of the terrain from the satellite pictures. Note that Mandal is called Manndalen and Kaafjord is Kafjorddalen on Google. Still, I wonder where Lockertsen's farmhouse is located. How exactly is the village of Furuflaten laid out? A modern update of this classic is overdue."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The will of a Norwegian resistance during World War II, who injured will fight to survive in extreme conditions.

I most definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about adventure and survival."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"We Die Alone is the first book I've ever read that in my opinion is a man's read . It states it is about World War 2, but it could have been a story of survival anywhere, as the war plays a very small, but important part of the story's reasonings. I enjoyed it, and I didn't think I would. The book lacks the emotional quality of most of the books I've read. It deals with surviving . . . pure and simply. It's pace is slow, but it doesn't drag. It welcomes you into what living through tragedy after tragedy must be like and you can't stop until you know whether he makes it or not. A great read . . . no, but a very good read . . . YES."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I've never been compelled to write a book review but this book deserves it.I'm simply in awe of this man and what he went through and my heart warmed by the kindness of total strangers.Just read it and you will never forget."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"12 men set out in a boat from the Shetland Islands.

This reviewer finished WDA in one sitting this past Christmas night. The resolution, which is not revealed here, will be readily obvious yet this does not lessen reader interest one iota. WDA is not spellbinding but the undercurrent of suspense stays constantly with the reader. The stark facts tell their own story. The setting is bare bones and sparse-perhaps in keeping with the bitter Norway cold. \\"Cold\\" is a key word in describing WDA because Mr. Baalsrud spends lots of time outdoors in it! At one point he is all but buried alive in snow, as a desperate Norwegian Resistance has nowhere else to conceal him from pursuing Germans. No review of WDA would be complete without giving homage to the fierce Resistance, which tied down some 280,000German troops. Military history fans seeking a fresh angle on WW2 and especially those who enjoy tales that deal with positive thinking, refusal to quit, and dedication to duty should enjoy WDA. Mr. Baalsrud had more of those qualities than any 10 of us will ever demonstrate. Unhappily, WDA possesses one huge weakness-no MAP! This is a common failing in all too many military stories but is inexcusable here. Geography is critical in Baalsrud's eastward flight to neutral Sweden. The inability to follow it without a map, or at least a World Atlas at hand, was frustrating. This is shameless insensitivity on the publisher's part and justifies subtracting a star from the above rating. By all means, read WDA but have a good map of Norway handy when you do."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The adventures in this book are simply mind boggling and unbelievable. I fell in love with Jan and cried and laughed and kept saying, &quot;NO WAY!&quot; all through it.

I wanted to see if it still gripped me like it did the first time. IT DID! The story takes place is Nazi occupied Norway during WWII. I don't want to give the story away but it is sufficient to say that the man in this story defies all odds to survive one of the most harrowing experiences ever put to paper. It is a tribute to one mans will to live. It is also a tribute to the brave men who risked death by the Nazis had they been caught helping him escape. Just thinking back on what this man went through in the extreme cold of Norway is mind-numbing. Its safe to say after reading this book you will put it down and just say WOW!!!"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The excellent Common Reader catalogue has been recommending this book forever in their catalogue and I can see why -- once you start, you can't put it down. Much like the other great survival tale, The Long Walk (which was probably even a notch above this one for sheer duration of suffering over multiple terrains with even worse odds of survival), this book follows the inredible suffering of a Norwegian hero who set sail from England on a Nazi raid in the northernmost regions of Norway. As usual, the Norwegians come out looking like real heroes -- just as they resisted Nazi occupation and didn't lie down to the treat of Hitler, so too many ordinary Norwegians risked their own lives and those of their families to save the young protagonist from sure death. A terrific read from start to finish!"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I bought this book for a buck at a used bookstore during a particularly low point in my life when I was just looking for a way to pass the time. It baffled me that this man would go through so much just to survive. He had no one else to live for but himself.

I think of this book whenever fear threatens to keep me living an insulated life."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I read this book in 1963 as a young girl.

And even though the book jacket tells you in advance that he actually made it to freedom, you can't get yourself to believe that this person will be able to survive what he is going through before you actually read it at the end of the book.This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"We Die Alone is the account of an amazing soldier who has the both the worst and greatest luck at the same time.

It is amazing that the hero of the story lived, and more amazing that he ever walked again. At one point he had to amputate his toes to keep gangrene from killing off the rest of his legs. I have a rather stout resolution, but if I'd been through what our hero endured, I believe I might have given up.

Simple villagers were willing to share their short rations and put their lives in danger in order to help this man. He lived completely alone for weeks in a snow cave with frozen feet and no food or company, during the harshest of weather conditions in occupied Norway.

Not only that, the story reveals the courage of a number of people who fought the evil Nazi empire in the only way they knew how on a personal basis to help a man they didn't even know.This is not a \\"fun\\" book to read.

The author was really able to bring the fear and pain of the subjects as they went through their horrific ordeal!"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I was never aware of the struggle of the Norwegian people against the Nazis.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The book was interesting as it told something about Norway during the war. It struck me as a short story that had been padded to qualify as a book."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"An awesome exploration of humankinds will to live and the compassionate people it takes to fulfill beating the odds."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"It is amazing to realize the resilience and tenacity of the human spirit and will to survive. Although written decades ago, and so much history has gone by since, it is still a vivid portrayal of one man's desperate travels to freedom. Imagine lying helplessly in a snowbank for weeks, totally relying on the kindness of strangers for survival.A true story, carefully compiled by the people Jan met along his incredible journey, it would be considered unrealistic, and impossible if written as fiction. It is really difficult to consider the circumstances where one would carefully amputate his own toes, with a few drops of brandy as an aesthetic.Impossible to put down, it races through a journey few can imagine. A must for everyone to read."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is a really excellent book about a group of Norwegian commandos who were infiltrated into Nazi-occupied Norway in WW2. The book is great reading as a true adventure story, and it would also be of some interest to soldiers and special forces who must work in hostile, cold environments. It can certainly be said that the hero of this story, Jan Baalsrud, achieved one of the great escapes of the second world war. But it might be more true to say that he really won an epic battle of survival against the forces of nature.Before going further ... let me thank previous reviewers who added their thoughts here on Amazon.com. If you really want to understand the story, you need to buy one of the older hard-cover versions of this book. These were printed back in the 1950's. These old versions have important maps on the inside covers, and the maps help considerably in understanding the background of what happened. Fortunately, the older hard copies can be found fairly readily by searching the used copies of the book. It's a shame that the recent paperback versions did not reproduce the maps.The subject of this story, Mr. Baalsrud, tried to infiltrate Norway with a small team of well-trained commandos. Unfortunately, the whole plan backfired when an incredible foul-up occurred with a local contact who was supposed to help the team (I won't spoil the surprise - read the story). After that, Mr. Baalsrud became very dependent upon his personal energy and resourcefulness, combined with the sympathy of Norwegian partisans, as he struggled to avoid capture in enemy-occupied territory. Ultimately, through mistakes of judgment about weather, he was plunged into a terrible struggle against the elements. It is actually hard to believe that he survived what happened to him - I can't imagine how anyone could be entombed in a frozen wasteland and get through the experience. So this really is an epic story of Man vs. Nature.Overall, I was very impressed by the spirit of the Norwegian partisans in WW2. Frankly, I had little knowledge of what took place in Norway under the Nazi's, and this book explains a lot about the exemplary people who lived in that country. The patriotic Norwegians made a mighty effort to save their own man, and by a miracle they managed to succeed. But only at great cost. So the background material about Norway was all very interesting and made for a great story.Overall, this is one of the finest escape stories from the WW2 era. But mostly - it is the true tale of an epic struggle between a man and the hostile forces of nature in the \\"white north\\" of Scandinavia."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Definitely worth reading. It's a fascinating story. The back cover blurb and Stephen Ambrose's foreward both compare it to Slavomir Rawicz's \\"The Long Walk\\", but it's actually better than Rawicz's tale, mostly because it's so well-documented. David Howarth takes great care in synchronizing the various accounts and piecing together the story; the included photos of the locations and people mentioned in the narrative also helped to cement its believability. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history or adventure stories in general. I'd also love to see it translated to film for the big screen: it has everything necessary to make a great movie, including a love story!"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is one of the most exciting books I have ever read. It can be read on many different levels:The Espionage Level: being hunted by Nazis through the wilds of Northern Norway.The Outdoor Survival Level: How he survived two avalanches, buried in snow for a week, cutting off his own toes after frostbite, cold-weather survival, travel in wild environments with minimal gear... its all here.The Psychological Strength Level: How a person can survive against the greatest adversities known to man... endurance, how to endure. Not to just talk it, but to actually endure.--------As a mountaineer who was raised in a wild environment of small town Vancouver Island, survival in cold weather, cold water, and over snow and glaciers has been something that I was raised upon. All of his exploits are something that one who loves and has experienced the outdoors will be able to relate to .... how would you handle this case (forget about the fact that Nazi's are chasing you), how would survive being buried, semicomatose in snow for a week... ?Despite the world's obsession on strength & endurance -- fantasized and read about -- more and more people are likely to take the easy way out of just about any adverse situation. Toughness of mind and body is intellectualised but rarely acted upon; the strongest thing your average modern person is likely to resort to is playing a video game, TV game adventures, reality TV and legal action against those you do not like... In this world people like Jan and his epic are a real inspiration. They have the courage to live their convictions and act out their moral convictions. They show us the importance of moral centre, and how people like him redeemed a generation of people, liberated a continent and delivered a world."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Jan Baaslrud's unbelievable tale of survival should be on every schools mandatory reading list. The message of one mans' unparalled will to survive is truly inspiring."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I bought this book because it was highly recommended by Stephen Ambrose, my favorite historian. I am glad I did.I'd put this book right up there with &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and &quot;Endeavor&quot; by Alfred Lansing as a first class adventure story. I still cannot believe that the facts of this story are true, that it was possible for Jan Baalsrud to survive in such harsh conditions for as long as he did and with as much good humor. The courage of the Norwegians who gave him aid and comfort is inspiring . This is truly a great book."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I will add to the chorus of praise for this book. Really very remarkable what a human being is capable of.If you liked this book, you might also check out \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"Alive\\", also very good survival stories."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"\\"We Die Alone\\" had been on my \\"To Read\\" shelf for ohh... about 10 years! I originally pulled the title from a National Geographic list of the Top 100 Adventure Stories. I think I took a pass on it because of the desperate title. \\"We Die Alone\\" sounds like such a guy-guy, survival book cliche'! I can just picture the park bench conversation, \\"Hey Dave, what'cha reading?\\" With my brow furrowed, I'd grit my teeth and half whisper, half growl, \\"...WE DIE ALONE!!!\\" Please don't let the blunt title fool you, this book is the real deal. The vintage story reads like adrenaline-infused fiction. It starts out as a sparse, suspenseful WW2 commando mission and turns into an incredible arctic survival story. The majority of this well documented and well told tale follows a desperate and stricken commando as he attempts to be carried by sympathizers across Norway's forsaken snow plateaus to neutral Sweden. Near Perfect, 5-Stars! The fifth star is for the timeless prose.

Also it is hard to feel the anxiety and fear that the local population felt from the Nazi presence.

I hadn't read any stories about the Norwegians in WW11 so it was an eyeopener."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is a MOST EXCELLENT story of individual perseverance and survival, and the courageous bravery of the Norwegian citizens that risked brutal Nazi reprisals to aid their stricken countryman. This is a translation into English; some of the translation is a little rough, which is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.This book recounts the story of Jan Baalsrud, the only surviving member of a Norwegian commando team that sneaks into Norway in March 1943 that gets betrayed by the first person they contact. The account of the physical and mental efforts he has to overcome to survive rival the best action thriller novels of today - yet this is a TRUE STORY.After his initial escape from the clutches of the Germans, Jan's main efforts are to escape to the Swedish border over the Arctic plateau, and find refuge in neutral Sweden. An expert cross country skier, he expects that he can make the journey in 2 or 3 days, but a brutal Arctic blizzard lasting 3 days hits the first day out, and Jan becomes lost and is further the victim of an avalanche. Walking through waist deep snow, he develops severe frost bite in his feet and legs, and is no longer able to walk on his own. Jan is now totally dependent on the assistance of the Norwegian citizens helping him.For the next 2 months, every attempt to get Jan to Sweden fails; at one point, he is left in a \\"snow grave\\" for 2 weeks waiting for the next group of Norwegians to find and assist him. Germans and another blizzard had delayed them from the original link up.Eventually, 2 Lapp herders are persuaded to take Jan to Sweden, where Jan recovers from his injuries and makes his way back to England to rejoin the war effort.There are at least 4 incidents where anyone with just an ounce less of perseverance would have given up and just died; that Jan was able to survive through all of this and return to the war, is what makes this story so remarkable."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Amazing what the human body can endure, and the risks that others are willing to take to help a stranger."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Interesting book of one mans refusal to die and the support under duress he recieved from his contry men while under german occupation"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I hold WWII soldiers with the highest honor and am always prepared for a great tale. This is nowhere near what I expected but was fascinating nonetheless and fills in holes of the war in other parts of the world where occupation was the fight vs. actual battles.A boat is sent from England to Norway but upon arrival is immediately detected. How can one man survive in occupied territory where he can trust only a few who he must meet without knowing they can be trusted? How does he survive trying to walk across a mountain and becoming snow blind prior to wandering into a farmhouse to the bewilderment of its inhabitants? How can he be carried out of a country since he is incapacitated and how long can a man live isolated in the high country with no food?This tale of survival is just epic and keeps opening your eyes to new mundane challenges! I do recommend this book.

Frostbitten and snowblind he is pursued by the Nazis.It is an astonishing true story of heroism and endurance and of the villagers who risk their own lives to help him."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Howarth's narrative of a World War II commando's survival against all odds behind enemy lines in Norway is a gripping tale of the triumph of the human spirit. Howarth immediately captures the tension as a small team of well-trained commandos recruited by the Allies embark on a hazardous mission to rendezvous with and coordinate the efforts of the Norwegian resistance. Within the first chapters, the reader is captivated as the entire mission is compromised and the sole survivor mounts an almost super-human effort to evade the enemy and survive the elements.Crafted from a mosaic of perspectives garnered from post-war interviews with the Norwegians whose lives touched and were touched by this commando, Howarth skillfully cobbles together the tattered fabric of this amazing story. Given up for dead on any number of occasions, this commando simply will not concede defeat. . . for to do so is to die. The reader is alternately amazed and repulsed by the strength of his spirit and will to survive.Setbacks abound. Uncommon courage is a common attribute of the civilians whose lives and communities are threatened if their abetting is discovered. Nature progressively invites greater enmity than the German pursuit. The reader is drawn ever more deeply into one man's battle for survival. Shunning any attempt at artful embellishment, Howarth compellingly portrays dignity under unimaginable duress. Undauntable spirit is found not only in works of fiction!Parallels to Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; will inevitably be drawn. Though superior in neither prose nor literary craftsmanship, &quot;We Die Alone&quot; dwarfs Krakauer's work in its conveyance of selflessness and the power of individuals united--vice divided--in their humanity. A moving story of an occupied country's heritage and a testimonial to the human spirit, it is a good and worthwhile read.-- Dan'l Steward, retired US Navy SEAL"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I first read this when I was teaching high school English. A fellow teacher of Norwegian heritage recommended it. It blew me away, and now twenty-five years later, I read it again. I had forgotten most of the details, but the effect remains--it is an incredible story of human survival. It is a testimony to the law that says in war nothing goes as planned and if something can go wrong, it will. It is also a testimony to the basic humanity and courage of ordinary people--the many who risked their lives to help Jan Balsrud when they could easily have left him for dead, as indeed he almost was. His suffering, determination to survive, and ultimate acceptance of what seemed to be certain death before his final rescue are inspiring to those of us who have not been so tested. The photographs that were included in the later edition were helpful and one can believe the entire story because of the documentation. This is a book that makes fiction pale beside it."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This amazing memoir will change the way you see, and appreciate life. An almost unbelievable story of human endurance, this has got to be the ultimate survival story. If a better one exists, I have yet to read it.The book chronicles the story of an American citizen of Norwegian descent, who joins the WWII effort via the English, on a secret mission to sabotage the Nazis in Norway. Their plan fails and they are discovered by the Nazis, and one of them, \\"Jan\\", escapes into the frigid Norwegian hinterlands. What follows is an incredible journey as Jan seeks the assistance of Norwegian locals who risk everything, under pain of death, to help him escape to Sweden. Since all roads and waterways are patrolled by the Nazis the only recourse is overland through the frozen deserts of the Norwegian highlands. Incredibly, Jan survives many weeks alone without food or shelter in the blizzards of the Norwegian Arctic.The author makes the case of how much we take for granted in our daily comforts. An inspirational story."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I am drawn to stories which highlight the strength and endurance of the human spirit. Some(like Mawson's Will) focus on an individual who survives the worst that nature has to offer through sheer guts and determination. Others (the Shackleton story) are studies of leadership in groups as a number of people overcome the same desperate circumstance.We Die Alone is unique because, although it focuses on Jan Baalsrud's incredible ordeal and his tenacious grip on life, he only survived because of the large number of people who risked their lives to help him. Early in the book we learn that two fishermen and two leading members of the resistance wound up dying in concentration camps because they were found out when the saboteurs were captured. These consequences for collaboration were well known and, conceivably, could have lead to the slaughter of a whole village. Certainly the Germans exhibited such tendencies during the war.That was what moved me about the book-the many people, young and old, who put aside their fear to do something noble and good for a fellow man and for their country.As a physician, I will say that although the story has been researched and authenticated, Jan's 3 week stay on a plateau with little shelter, little fluid, and in extremely poor physical shape seemed beyond incredible. It seems to be that he would have succumbed to hypothermia in a much shorter time. Yet, amazing things can and do happen.That notwithstanding, I read the book in what amounted to one sitting. It was quite riveting."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I stumbled on David Howarth's &quot;We Die Alone&quot; while searching for something else; it sounded interesting, so I ordered it and finally got the time to read it while moving to a new duty station. I couldn't put it down. The story is inspiring and unforgettable; it touches your heart and soul. More importantly, and probably more profoundly, it is the true account of a man's dedication, courage, and selflessness to his country's plight. There are a lot of good books, but only a few books are so powerful in their ability to make a lasting impression. This one does that. As a matter of fact, I lost the book and have spent the last 8 months trying to find it. I couldn't, so I reordered it. Buy it, read it and keep it."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"In a plain and straightforward manner, David Horwath recounts the incredible true story of a Norwegian commando sent back to his defeated homeland to sabotage a Nazi airfield. The mission is discovered and compromised before it really gets started--but the story has just begun.The commando, Jan Baalsrud, embarks on an incredible journey as he attempts to escape back to friendly lines. He is aided here and there by his countrymen, who risk their own lives and the lives of their families and villages to save him, long after, by all odds, he should be dead.As I read the book I was reminded of Ken Follett's &quot;Eye Of The Needle&quot;, but with two distinct differences: Jan Baalsrud is a hero, not a villan. And this is a true story, not fiction."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"My paperback copy did not contain a map. The Table of Contents lists the map as appearing on the &quot;endpaper&quot;, which apparantly was not incorporated into the paperback edition. Things were a little confusing without one, but it was possible to deduce approximately the distances involved and directions taken. Overall, this was a minor detraction from an otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Jan Baalsrud was the only survivor of an Allied commando raid gone wrong in German-occupied Norway during WWII. His ship explodes in a Norwegian port, all of his companions are either killed or captured, and Jan escapes on foot into the interior of northern Norway in the middle of winter. Jan repeatedly swims icy fjord waters, traverses monstrous peaks with practically no equipment and ill-fitting boots, survives blizzards and an avalanche, outwits patrolling Germans, amputates his own frostbitten toes with a pocket knife, lives buried under snow drifts with very little food for weeks on end, and more. We Die Alone is a remarkable story of individual survival, but what really makes it special is the role in Baalsrud's escape taken on by everyday Norwegians during wartime, at grave risk to themselves and to their families.It has been said that a guerrilla war cannot be successful without support from the population in general. The German blitzkrieg overran Norway so quickly at the beginning of WWII that many Norwegians did not have time to organize a meaningful resistance. They instead worked underground for the Allies after the occupation, organizing right under the German's noses. When I had the good fortune to visit the Norwegian Resistance Museum in Oslo, I marveled at the ingenuity of the hidden radio transmitters the Norwegian Underground used to communicate with the Allies in England during the Nazi occupation. The largely unheralded Norwegian Underground mobilized when Jan Baalsrud stumbled into a remote village in northern Norway half frozen and dying. The Underground took him in and launched an almost unbelievable rescue operation to transport him over the nearly impassable snow-covered mountains by sledge and into neutral Sweden.One drawback of this book has to do with the numerous typos in the text. This book was originally published several years ago, and if I can identify this many errors in one reading a professional proofreader or editor should be able to spend a day or two with it and give this classic narrative the cleaning up that it richly deserves. If you are going to publish and profit from this book, please respect the work.Time and time again while reading We Die Alone I had to remind myself that Jan Baalsrud's story is true. The book was meticulously researched and documented by author David Howarth who returned to Norway after the war to revisit the people and locations described firsthand. The photographs are a nice plus. The entire ordeal is a testament to the amazing power of the human spirit and to the perseverance of the will to live. We Die Alone belongs among the best books of the genera. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I am 17 years old, and not many books would interest a kid at my age, but this one did and it stuck with me. The main character, Jan, goes through unbearable pain throughout the whole book. Almost every time I was in disbelief that at the end of the book I was reading that this man would be alive. This is not just a compelling story, but the lessons that he learns in weeks of loneliness mean something to the reader. I think about this story almost every day whether I'm in basketball practice with a lot of running to do or on a long cold walk to school. I'd be embarrassed to complain about anything after hearing what the man went through in this book. It puts a perspective on life, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a compelling story that gives you something to think about after."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I'm not a compulsive reader of fantastic true survival stories, but this one was available on tape from the public library, and I have some Norwegian in my genes.It started with a lot of bullets over the head and exploding boats and boots lost in the snow and frostbite -- many, many good people who risk their lives for something intangible. The book, I feel, is very good at expressing the states of mind of the people involved -- it's not a simple recounting of events.But there's one major event that starts about 2/3 of the way through the book, which was so fantastic that I sort of didn't believe it... until I met two of the people involved in the organization that rescued him. That event says so much about the power of the human mind -- how much our thought and will do, after all, determine whether we live or die.One other thing that sticks in my mind concerns the Lapps. The Norwegians are good skiers and strong people by modern civilized standards (I mean that itsy bitsy country beats the whole world in the winter Olympics). The story tells how they tried several times to get Jan across the Swedish border, but just couldn't get the sledge far enough given the time constraints, the weather and the topography. They tried to involve the Lapps early on, but the Lapps have a different approach to such things. Like most nomads, they won't leave their herds, but they do leave their weak behind to die in the snow. Then after a month or two, a Lapp migrates into town and decides to check out the situation. Horwath describes how he just stands there for 3-4 hours staring at him in the Arctic snow, and then finally resolves to take him across into Sweden. He and his friend receive some brandy in gratitude, drink several bottles in one night and seem none the worse for it, and then the following morning kind of non-chalantly pull off what the Norwegians could not. That combination of ability to do what their more sophisticated neighbors could not combined with the lack of sense of urgency interests me."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"While the book was written two generations ago (1955), it is still quite fresh. Little was known about the role of the Norwegian resistance before Hogarth wrote this book. The endurance of the only operative alive out of the original 12 equals that of Hillary and Shakelton. It is written in \\"earth tone\\", very much like With the Old Breed, by Eugene Sledge."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is the ultimate survival tale - a man who survived a German attack is stranded in the Arctic for months during the winter and lives to tell his tale. The book was a little hard for me to get into at first, but it is worth pushing past some of the dry parts. Jan's tale is inspiring on several levels - not only did he refuse to die despite the fact that the odds were repeatedly against him, but he encountered so much help along his journey from people who risked their lives to move him to safety. Some parts of the story are a bit long, but overall this was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is an easy-to-read book that tells of a gripping true-life story in WWII. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do - again & again. Fiction can never be as exciting. For anyone who likes suspenseful thrillers, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"There are so many other reviews that I won't even bother discussing the main events in this book. Suffice it to say that it is among the most incredible tales of survival that you will ever read, fiction or non-fiction. Jack London would have been afraid to submit such an outlandish tale to his publishers.That said, a few thoughts:1. I found the actions of the local Norwegian \\"Resistance Movement\\" almost more interesting than the actual tale. To be caught helping Baalsrud was an act the occupying Nazis would have punished severely, both the actual person that did it, his family and maybe even the whole village. And yet the local villagers were, for the most part, not intimidated. The bigger concern seemed to be that if too many people found out about the rescue effort, their attempts to help would be noticed by the Nazi occupiers and raise suspicions.2. Even more amazing, people in the next village were recruited based just on a request from a respected member of the first village. All this, without the use of a telephone, which was probably tapped by the Germans. Imagine your reaction if someone you don't know showed up at your door and said that so-and-so from the next town over wants you to climb a mountain in a blizzard and rescue someone...nevermind that the Germans will kill you and your family if you get caught...just do it.3. Baalsrud spends several weeks in a snow cave on the Norwegian \\"Outback\\", sometimes completely buried, with very limited supplies of food, fresh water, blankets or medical supplies. I am not sure I believe this is even possible, but yet the author seems to have done a credible job of researching the story. There are multiple sources for research material, and a credible looking timeline. Either Baalsrud is capable of hibernating, or memories have been corrupted in the ten years between the events and the story being told. I would believe either scenario.4. As many have pointed out, the editing and proofreading on this book were horrible. These sorts of errors ruin my reading experience, and most times I would abandon reading a book with this level of problems. In this instance, the story was captivating enough that I powered through the mistakes. The story was better than the proofreading was bad.5. The Kindle edition did not have a map-something sorely needed. Even Google-maps seemed unable to rise to the task for some of the locations mentioned in the story. An old Atlas that I hadn't used in years, showing topography and little hamlets of Norway, greatly enhanced the story.So find a good map, ignore the grammar and writing style, and start reading. You might have to suspend disbelief at some of the details, but no doubt the major points of the story are true. If nothing else, the tale of Jan Baalsrud and the Norwegian villagers will reaffirm your faith in the human will and spirit.Finally, since the characters in the story seemed to run on brandy, pour yourself a glass and toast these men and women...preferably on a cold, windy winter evening."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is a story I enjoyed reading right from the opening chapter. I like stories that ring true and depict human endurance that make our daily ordeals look pale in comparison. We Die Alone does just that, with Jan and his friends going through trials that take them through hell and back. I like the era, WWII, after reading Disciples of Fortune that has a similar setting. The plot of We Die Alone is brilliant and the writing flows in an effortless manner, bringing forth a strong narration and succinct dialogue.

This story illustrates this misconception.Set in WWII, the book tells the story of Jan Baalsrud, a Norwegian who after receiving training in Britain attempted to return to Norway to undermine the German occupation of his homeland. Intercepted by the Germans before they even were able to unload their cargo (in disguise as a fishing vessel) Jan was the only of his team to evade capture, escape to neutral Sweden and ultimately go back to Britain.Although he was injured in his escape, Jan is able to seek out help and evade capture as he makes his way towards freedom. Ultimately, Jan's condition deteriorates and he is forced to rely on others to carry him to his final destination. Those assisting him take on great risk to themselves and their families as they hide him and provide what care they can. Jan is frequently required to spend extended periods of time both alone and exposed to the Arctic elements, isolated from those assisting him and unsure of their status or even eventual return.An inspiring story of not only a man surviving the seemingly impossible (Jan lost half his bodywieght in the ordeal), but also those who had little to gain risking it all to save this one man."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I enjoy real life adventure and this story reminds one how soft we really are .It is well written and is hard to put down .How brave those men were , and thank God the Germans lost the war .Brave also were the folk who helped our hero to avoid capture .I am enjoying my Kindle , Its new to me and it is encouraging me to read more often .

Every bit of what Jan went thru, and it was unbelievable, seemed to be there. The writer some how transformed himself into Jan, it was so real. It may be tedious to some, but to others who are truly interested in what happened and what Jan and his helpers when thru; it was hard to put this book down. People who enjoy psychology and moderate to heavy deep thinkers would enjoy this especially. There is some action as well, but much of it dwells on how Jan gets thru day to day on the edge of death, sick and crippled and waiting for his saviors, and what his saviors go thru as well.

Read this book, and you'l find out what hardship really is."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The true survival story of Jan Baalsrud in Nazi-occupied Norway is an astonishing and most inspiring account of one man's will to survive and how local villagers risked everything to help him do so.We Die Alone is a testament to the human will to survive, a soldier's resolve to live and return home, and the power of a united people's ability to reach what seemed an unreachable objective.Jos&eacute; AstorgaAuthor: A Bull in a Glass Houseabullinaglasshouse.com"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"A harrowing tale of survival and the unconquerable will of an extraordinary soldier, We Die Alone assumes its rightful place among the greatest WWII survival stories ever told. Jan Baalsrud's exploits are testament to the capacity of the human spirit to survive while facing nearly impossible odds. Baalsrud repeatedly defies death as he braves the harsh Norwegian winter while eluding capture and certain torture and execution at the hands of the Nazis occupying Norway in 1943.This is not just a tale of one man's exceptional courage and endurance, but of the loyalty of many proud Norwegians who resist the Nazi occupation and who ultimately assist Baalsrud in his efforts to escape and evade across the brutal, frozen Norwegian tundra. While adjectives such as 'incredible', 'unbelievable', and 'amazing' are readily applied to Baalsrud's stubborn refusal to die, it is without question the devotion of these compassionate Norwegian villagers that perhaps deserves our deepest admiration. Whether to simply defy the Nazi occupiers or whether out of compassion for a remarkable countryman, these people repeatedly extend themselves, in some cases, even beyond the limits of human endurance to save Baalsrud's life.'Audacious' best describes the mission undertaken by the British-trained commandos as they enter Norwegian waters near Tromso at the book's outset. When betrayed by one of the supposed partisans assigned to help secure their landing, the commando team is quickly rounded up and those still alive executed. The lone survivor, Baalsrud, remains at large and makes his way by alternately swimming, hiking, and skiing through the treacherous waters, rock, snow and ice of the Norwegian arctic wilderness.Although Baalsrud, through a combination of good fortune, pluck, and feats of practically superhuman endurance, evades capture as he seeks refuge in neutral Sweden, he very nearly succumbs to exposure. Again, it is not without the aid of his brave countrymen that he manages to elude the Nazis while eventually making his way to a tiny village, Furuflaten, roughly 25 miles from the Swedish border. It is near there that Baalsrud faces down death yet again for 27 days in an icy, snow-covered 'grave' on a plateau in the mountains of northern Norway. If not for the aid of the inhabitants of Furuflaten he would have certainly died and quite literally been entombed in ice and snow.This is not the first time we witness Baalsrud's uncanny ability to fend off doubt and mental resignation in his struggle to stay alive - nor the last. As the days tick by and as his resolve begins to weaken, he reaches deep and summons additional reserves of both mental and physical strength. He sort of chips away at his despair by treating himself to bits of food and an occasional swallow of brandy. Most astonishing perhaps, he endures and even seems to gain energy by continually reminding himself of the loyalty and even love of those of his countrymen who have dedicated themselves to saving his life. It becomes apparent that he is willing himself to live partly in order to not let his protectors down.In We Die Alone we are witness to feats of endurance which are beyond our ability to comprehend. When we see Baalsrud perform a type of crude surgery with a pocketknife on his gangrenous feet and lower legs we finally grasp the depth of this man's desire to live. And when he is eventually transported by Lapps on the final leg of his journey to Sweden strapped to a reindeer-driven sled we cannot help but cheer his final triumph over death.Baalsrud's story is perhaps all the more remarkable because of the risk Norwegians faced at the hands of the Nazis during the occupation. If found aiding and abetting a fugitive, a Norwegian could be summarily executed. Nevertheless, ordinary Norwegians defied the Nazi occupiers and took extraordinary risks to save Jan Baalsrud.We Die Alone is testament to Norwegians' pride in their country and to the inner strength and fortitude of this unique race of people. Indeed, these qualities ensured that the German occupiers would find a worthy adversary in the Norwegian resistance movement. When we read about the actions of the Norwegian resistance in saving Baalsrud's life we are not surprised to learn that the Nazi occupation eventually required some 400,000 troops.You will not want to put this one down!"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This is a wonderful story of extraordinary courage. Most of the reviews say this. I was particularly interested to learn about operations in areas that are not well documented in English. The bulk of the story takes place in Norway and I found that very interesting. I have read many World War II escape stories where the goal was Switzerland and a few to Spain. This is the first chance I have had to learn about escapes to Sweeden. This book is highly recomended."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"A great book. Don't miss this one if you enjoy history & stories of survival against all odds.Others to enjoy with this one: Ghost Soldiers & The Long Walk."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"For most of my reading I tend toward things of non-fiction, believing that the real is more fantastic than anything imagined. This was surely the case in this account of survival in the wastelands of Northern Norway during WW.II. Like others who've read this report by David Howarth, I was caught up in the drama of people going out of their way, and at high risk, to save a man from the German forces. And not only their determination but the ongoing faith and hope of Jan Baalsrud as he faced the dire possibilities of death. It is difficult to imagine the pain when Jan had to cut off his own toes with a rusty knife as he languished in a snow cave. It is a grand story of courage set against the impossibilities posed by mountain peaks,blinding snow storms, wild animals and an enemy ready to shoot anyone.

Reading this book in my youth was such a memorable experience that I still remembered the hero's name!In the annals of heroic survival this book deserves a top spot.I am looking forward to rereading it these many years later."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Imagine you are in World War II. Think of entering a battlefield. Gunshots, bombs dropping, people dying around you. You will feel yourself trying to stay alive. In David Howarth's book, We Die Alone, a group of Norwegian/English commandos are sent to Norway to teach the townsfolk demolition. They set up camp on an island that is seemingly safe from Nazis. They are betrayed and all but one, Jan, die. Jan escapes and then finds a town with people who care for him. After a few days, they send him on his way along with some hope. Then an avalanche occurs, smothering that hope, and him in the process. Jan happens to be stuck in the snow with his skis broken. Somehow he finds another helpful town and in the town an anti-Nazi organization attempts to move him to Sweden. Will his journey continue, or will he die alone?This is a remarkable book, with amazing characters. If there are things you want to learn about World War II or Norway, or you just want to read a fantastic book, read this one. There were lots of challenges for Jan, especially when he was buried between snow and rock for two weeks. That was probably the most memorable part. The really amazing thing is that this story about brave, stubborn people is true. The men from Mandal, a town next to a plateau where Jan was buried, take a risk to find Jan and then to keep him supplied with food and drink while a German troop is camped in their town.There are many exciting things about this book. The description of Norway is terrific and creates images of this rough terrain. You can almost feel the wind and snow blow into your face. It seems real because you know if Jan is caught, he is going to die a horrid, ugly death at the hands of the Nazis. That's what makes this true story sometimes scary.This book made me wonder if I could be brave. I think if I was strong enough, I could be brave like Jan, but I'm not sure I could be brave like the Mandal people. I might just chicken out and turn Jan over to the Nazis. But I would have to be there to know, which I would not want to happen. This book was a pleasure to read, and I hope other people have a chance to enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I just read this while on vacation. It's an important story of personal courage and sacrifice in a theater of WW II that gets very little attention. As Ambrose says in his introduction, it's a war story but it's not. There's very little about the war: the war only provides the background for the larger human story. It's a book that you won't want to put down, and you'll be enriched by knowing a man like Jan Baalsrud.I debated between 4 and 5 stars only because I read Unbroken immediately after this. We Die Alone is a \\"smaller\\" book than Unbroken. It doesn't sweep the historical and cultural landscape as widely, and Baalsrud's story doesn't have all the added dimensions of Louie Zamperini's life. But, this is a great book in it's own right. Stephen Ambrose listed it among his top 5, so that's a pretty good endorsement."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Flew through this book on a six-hour plane trip. Could not put it down.

Jan swims a shore in below freezing conditions and shoots and kills a few german soldiers.

The author also shows the great risk that Norwegian families faced as they assisted and harbored a fellow Norwegian who was willing to fight against the Nazi forces that had invaded their country. Evasion, bitter cold conditions, and the sheer will to survive alone for many weeks shows the level of endurance and strength that Jan Baalsrud demonstrated throughout his ordeal. It is a true story of a man who refused to capitulate to the enemies he faced, both the military and the climatic conditions on the northern frontier of Norway during World War II."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I enjoyed the story but it did take me longer to finish than I would have wanted. The local citizens who helped him were the real heros. He just sort of went along for the ride. The locals left him up in the mountains a few times by himself without the ability to move. They basically left him to die and by shear chance he didn't. After a while they felt so bad for him they came to the conclusion that he had suffered enough and at that point risked their lives to get him over the mountain range, out of enemy territory, and into the hands of the allies. He lived to tell the tale but I'm not overly impressed with his actions."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"An extraordinary story of courage and determination.

This reviewer finished WDA in one sitting this past Christmas night. The resolution, which is not revealed here, will be readily obvious yet this does not lessen reader interest one iota. WDA is not spellbinding but the undercurrent of suspense stays constantly with the reader. The stark facts tell their own story. The setting is bare bones and sparse-perhaps in keeping with the bitter Norway cold. \\"Cold\\" is a key word in describing WDA because Mr. Baalsrud spends lots of time outdoors in it! At one point he is all but buried alive in snow, as a desperate Norwegian Resistance has nowhere else to conceal him from pursuing Germans. No review of WDA would be complete without giving homage to the fierce Resistance, which tied down some 280,000German troops. Military history fans seeking a fresh angle on WW2 and especially those who enjoy tales that deal with positive thinking, refusal to quit, and dedication to duty should enjoy WDA. Mr. Baalsrud had more of those qualities than any 10 of us will ever demonstrate. Unhappily, WDA possesses one huge weakness-no MAP! This is a common failing in all too many military stories but is inexcusable here. Geography is critical in Baalsrud's eastward flight to neutral Sweden. The inability to follow it without a map, or at least a World Atlas at hand, was frustrating. This is ... insensitivity on the publisher's part and justifies subtracting a star from the above rating. By all means, read WDA but have a good map of Norway handy when you do."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"A factual and interesting story of sacrifice, survival and patriotism amongst the cruel artic climes of WW 2 occupied Norway."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"nerve wracking reading but a truly good book I would definitely recom mend it to anyone who likes real suspense -"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"If it was fiction, it would be unbelievable - but it's actually a true story of a soldier's courageous, desperate, brave and ultimately vulnerable and dependent situation in Norway during WWII.

The writing is good and descriptive, and is only occasionally confusing. Overall this is a really good story with believable events. Worth reading.FULL REVIEW: The escape story does not actually begin until about the third chapter but the story of a planned sabotage keeps your attention until then. Once he escapes off on his own it is not long before he runs into people who help him out. The escape story is made somewhat less amazing because of this, only because he does not survive with his own planning and strength. The story relies on the help of others throughout the whole escape. But what he endures and gets away with and what people do to sneak him to safety is what makes this a good story. There is constant action and continual tension of whether he will get caught, all of which makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"An interesting tale of a guy trying to fight the Nazi's but fails.

Courageous people -all of them.Did not want the story to end.Than you Mr. Howarth"},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"There are few tales of epic endurance that can match this, in fact I find it hard to believe that anyone could have lived through this at all. I kept re-reading parts because I couldn't believe what I was reading. David Howarth's true story of the escape of Jan Baalsrud, a Norwegian Saboteur, in the Spring of 1943 was a page turner, I kept wondering how it could possible get end up, and each time I thought things were as bad as they could get it got worse.It is a simple tale of escape and those brave souls who helped him make his way from Norway to neutral Sweden. In March 1943 Jan was part of group of 11 other men who travelled secretly to German held Norway in order to sabotage an airbase. However through an extraodinarily bad coincidence the contact they made there was with a man who betrayed them. Their boat was ambushed by the Germans the following morning, 30th of March. Interestingly there is the German news account of this ambush in the appendix at the back of the book and it does not tally well with the real event. Only Jan managed to escape from the ambush. The fate of the rest of his crew, which is only known in sketchy detail was horrific so his decision to try flee rather than surrender proved the right thing to do. However this left him alone on a bleak tiny island in the Norwegian Sounds with his toe shot off in the freezing arctic spring. The next two months he swam through icy seas, got caught in blizzards and avalanches and finally too injured to carry on himself, was carried by partisan Norwegians to Sweden. I don't know what is more incredible about this story or this man. His will was astonishing. For one week he was left alone on a deserted plateau alone with almost no food, frost bitten feet and wet clothes. When he was finally found again he had to endure a further two weeks living alone on the plateau with only occassional visitors.I have read a lot of epic survival stories in my time - of Shackleton, and Scott and their epic journeys, but these men were generally part of a group and if nothing else may draw strength from their companions. For much of Jan's trip he was alone, and very often so weak and vulnerable his survival while others worked for his survival, very often for days at a time he was vulnerable and alone and with no hope that anyone would come and rescue him, yet he survived. Each time men came to him expecting to find him dead and he wasn't - he was clinging to life. This is such a powerful story, and well told. I don't think you could read it and remain unmoved."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"first read this incredible tale of one man's refusal to die alone forty years ago--have been recommending to people ever since. jan baalsrud--a norwegian patriot during wwII--captured my imagination in the page's of david howarth's riveting book, and his story of survival under the relentless pursuit of the nazi's, is maybe the best to come out of that war. page after page, the twists and turns, the chance meetings and narrow escapes, the unrelenting suspense...a book you simply can't put down. and written well enough that it doesn't matter if you're a seventh grader, as i was four decades ago, or a senior citizen, as i'm rapidly becoming. its just a great read. you'll never forget jan baalsrud..guaranteed."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"One winter, in the midst of WWII, a crew of expatriate Norwegians attempted to land a cargo of guerilla supplies on Nazi-occupied Norway's far-northern coast. This book tells the story of the incredible privation endured by one of those men, Jan Balsruud, his hardihood and survival, and the risks and sacrifices undertaken on his behalf by the men and women who help him evade capture.I first read _We_Die_Alone_ some thirty years ago, in the first paperback edition, and I know that certain of its scenes and events will stay with me so long as I live. Howarth recounts the story simply, and lets the facts provide the drama.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"~~~~~~~~ IN FAVOUR: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I found this to be an intriguing true story. Jan Baalsrud, the sole survivor of a foiled commando mission in German-occupied Norway cheated death about half-a-dozen times before eventually escaping to neutral Sweden (from which he had been expelled years before). The man's travails are extraordinary: surviving three days of wandering in the far north completely snowblind; amputating nine of his own toes with no anaesthetic; being literally buried under a blanket of snow for a week and thus - ironically - surviving the blizzard which raged above it. The story takes so many turns for the incredible that one begins to understand why author David Howarth prefaced his book with the assertion that he made every effort to verify the details of Baalsrud's account.The even stranger thing is that Baalsrud is arguably not even the hero of the book. The real heroes are the ordinary rural Norwegians who took him in, cared for him, and ran enormous risks for him - because for much of this story Baalsrud was incapacitated. Each Norwegian he met after the initial Quisling who betrayed his team risked their own lives and that of their families in order to ensure that Baalsrud made it to safety. This sequence of events is even more remarkable in view of the fact that there was nothing the locals could have gained from Baalsrud's survival even by proxy: one crippled soldier, after all, could mount no resistance to the Germans who persecuted them. So the denizens of Norway's far north were not helping Baalsrud so that he would help them: What they did for him was done from motives of purest solidarity.~~~~~~~~ AGAINST: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are, however, two things which vitiated this reading experience.1. The most obvious one is the sheer number of spelling errors in the text. At most, even a long book will contain three typos. \\"We Die Alone\\" is a 200-page book in which a typo appears on about every fifth page. The sheer concentration of mistakes in the book (even befouling photo captions) makes for an ongoing distraction: it's like going out for a pleasant walk and finding yourself tripping over obstacles every twenty paces.How did it happen? Consider the following sequence of examples:[p. 52:] \\"... he like the idea ...\\"[p. 53:] \\"... He house was the telegraph office ...\\"[p. 56:] \\"... More over, the shopkeeper had told him ...\\"[p. 67:] \\"... on skies he would be confident ...\\"[p. 67:] \\"... chance acquaintances to whom he owned his life ...\\"[p. 75:] \\"... and then came to and end ...\\"[p. 93:] \\"... but a least they could talk ...\\"Spot the pattern? Every misspelled word accidentally forms another word - different, but correctly spelled. There is not a single exception in the book. Conclusion? The publishers ran the manuscript through the spell-checking software but never bothered with a proofreader. The result is heap of distracting mistakes. That's slack.Is the problem the author's? The book was written in 1955; this edition came out in 1999. Even if the typos belonged to Howarth, what did the publishers gain by preserving them? Only the blame, it would seem. Anyway, Howarth has other problems:2. The author's prose style often strikes the wrong note, sometimes even creating outright gaffes. Examples include:[p. 61:] \\"It was hard that these men were taken ...\\"[p. 62:] \\"The other two were tortured to the point of death, and then put in the Catholic hospital, where they died.\\"[p. 62:] \\"Their own countrymen judged them hardly.\\"My favourite goof occurs when Howarth describes a scene in which a local villager conducts a conversation with Baalsrud in fluent Norwegian, whereupon the author renders the man's thoughts as follows:[p. 69] \\"It seemed much more likely that [Baalsrud] was a German deserter.\\"~~~~~~~~ IN SUMMARY: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is a great story; I'm really glad it has found a readership; but it's a shame that the publishers where [sic] lazy."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Second only to Slavomir Rawicz's The Long Walk in the annals of WWII escape stories I've read, the story of Jan Baalsrud's amazing escape after a failed commando insertion into occupied Norway is more a tale of endurance than one of derring-do. Penned by a former British spymaster, the book is a clear, if somewhat simply written, account of how Baalsrud was sheltered for weeks by various patriotic Norwegians who did their best to keep him out of German hands.An expatriate Norwegian, Baalsrud and his fellow commandos were attempting to establish a resistance cell in northern Norway that would disrupt the operations of a major German airfield nearby. Betrayed, the commandos were ambushed by German soldiers, with only Baalsrud escaping. The bulk of the book described how over the next several weeks, regular citizens in remote villages attempted to keep him alive while arranging for him to get to Sweden. This was greatly hampered by the frostbite that made walking or skiing impossible for him. It's an excellent glimpse into the mundane details of how regular people did their best to resist the Germans with the knowledge that they and their families would be killed if their plotting was uncovered.Ultimately though, the book is a tribute to Baalsrud's incredible physical and emotional endurance-he was buried alive for days under snow, left by himself for days at a time unable to move and in excruciating pain, and had to contemplate self-surgery-all while knowing that his discovery could mean the deaths of many innocent people. Think you're tough? Read this and think again! It would have been nice if the publisher had included a map."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I rarely bother with adventure stories, but Howarth's fine prose swept me into this tale and kept me at it. The last half of the book I took in one sitting. We hardly care about the protagonist, Jan Baalsrud, as a personality. He has remarkable courage and incredible physical stamina but little spiritual depth. In the hands of a lesser writer, his story could easily have degenerated into a limp survival yarn of the sort regularly published in Reader's Digest. But Howarth gives meaning to the story both through his fine description of the harsh natural world and by his sympathetic treatment of the dozens of volunteers who came to Baalsrud's rescue. Their attempt to rescue one soldier at the risk of their lives became a political as well as a humanitarian cause, virtually the only blow these Norwegians could strike against German invaders in the wastelands of northern Scandinavia."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"'We Die Alone' was written by David Howarth in the mid-1950s, drawing on his Second World War experience of running espionage operations sent into German occupied Europe. The book recounts the experience of Norwegian Jan Baalsrud, the sole survivor from an abortive attempt to land a commando team on the coast of northern Norway. Baalsrud made his way across Norway in the depths of winter, eventually to find safety in neutral Sweden. The heart of the book is about Baalsrud's amazing capacity to endure extreme hardship, frostbite, and long weeks of isolation in Norway's unbelievably harsh northern plateau region. Ultimately his survival rested on the willingness of the Norwegian people to feed and find him shelter even through the penalty for harbouring a spy was certain death should the German occupiers find out.After the war David Howarth built a successful career for himself as a popular historian. For this book his admirably clear writing style has been paired down to match the absolute simplicity of Norway's stark winter environment. The writing is unadorned and spare. It perfectly suits the context, describing in a matter-of-fact way Baalsrud's incredible survival story. Here is a man who amputated nine of his own toes to prevent the spread of gangrene as he lay alone for three weeks in a shallow snow cave waiting for his rescuers to organise an escape to Sweden.Reading about such events naturally leads to a sense of puzzlement about how Baalsrud survived hardships that would have killed most people put into a similar situation. David Howarth makes no direct attempt to explain this puzzle, but does explore his subject's psychology. It was as if Baalsrud simply could not conceive of giving up. Even well beyond the point when his Norwegian helpers imagined that he must have died from exposure, Baalsrud doggedly focussed on staying alive hour by hour until, close to death, nomadic Laplanders took him by reindeer-drawn sledge to safety.'We die alone' has been through many printings. The absence of a map spoils my 2000 edition from the UK publishers, Cannongate. But readers can follow Baalsrud's journey with any large scale map of Northern Scandinavia."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This astounding account of survival gives the reader a perspective Americans are not generally familiar with--life within a country occupied by a ruthless enemy. Jan Baalsrud's uncanny survival story is told within the context of the north Norwegian underground resistance, and in that account is as inspiring as Soldiers of the Night and other volumes devoted entirely to the European resistance to the nazis. The only thing more terrifying than the German occupation forces are the impossible Arctic conditions Baalsrud and those who helped him to escape somehow survived. This true story is first-rate adventure and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"I received this book two days ago as an early Christmas present, having never heard of it either by title or author, and quite frankly I'm amazed that a story recounting heroism of this magnitude had escaped my notice for so long a time. As I'm writing these thoughts, I still have not finished reading the book, although as soon as I'm done recording these thoughts I have every intention of finishing it. The one (minor) quibble I have with the book is that the Author/narrator has a tendency to over-explain himself, and at times this results in an annoying tendency to put himself directly in the path of the story he's trying to tell. This caveat aside, I'm finding this work a truly compelling, sometimes horrifying and ultimately uplifting tale of the power of the human spirit to prevail against seemingly insurmountable odds. I would highly recommend this book to lovers of adventure tales in particular, and to readers of both fiction and non-fiction suspense and intrigue in general."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"Mr. Howarth has captured an amazing WWII escape, from under the noses of the Nazi's, in a form which is both easily read and understood. From the moment of the failed Allied mission in the most northernly reaches of Norway, in the winter, to the final escape and recap, it is a fast moving, captivating historical account of the ordeals of one allied soldier, alone in occupied territory. A &quot;must read&quot; for any war buff or anyone who likes amazingly true stories. The author captured the real events by interviewing the participants after the war was over and reconstructing the whole scenario along with the principle, Jan Baalsrud. The bravery of those who helped Mr. Baalsrud escape is to be admired and be a lesson to all who face danger and trails in their lives. Jan's ordeal pushed the understanding of the limits of the human being's survival instincts to the a new level.

True to my friend's description, David Howarth's \\"We Die Alone,\\" the gripping account of the harrowing escape of Jan Baalsrud from Nazi-occupied Norway, was a page-turner from start to finish.Baalsrud and three other Norwegian commandos, with a mission to organize and supply Norwegian resistance fighters, sailed from England to Nazi-occupied Norway aboard a fishing boat with its crew of eight. Betrayed by a collaborator, the group was ambushed by German soldiers, and Baalsrud was the sole survivor.Wounded and pursued by the Germans through March snows in Norway's arctic north, Baalsrud somehow survived raging snowstorms, an avalanche, frostbite, snow-blindness, and being buried in snow. He did receive help from several courageous Norwegian citizens, but it was too dangerous to keep him in their homes with the Nazis searching for him everywhere. For his safety and their own, they carried him up a mountain on a sled and lowered him into a hole that was four feet deep, \\"exactly the size of a grave,\\" gave him some food and brandy and left him, promising to return. Baalsrud spent twenty-seven days in this hole, wrapped in a sleeping bag, exposed to wind and snow. It was here that the snow eventually covered him over and he was buried under the snow for four days. During his ordeal, Baalsrud actually amputated his own toes with a pocket knife, an operation doctors later said saved his foot and leg. Finally with the help of a Lapp reindeer herder, he made his way to neutral Sweden and a hospital, having survived an ordeal which one reviewer said \\"would have killed ninety-nine men out of a hundred.\\"For readers of adventure stories or history buffs interested in the Second World War, David Howarth's \\"We Die Alone\\" is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"When you read a book that you know is true and you find yourself not believing it, then you know it is an amazing story.

I am buying this book for everyone on my Christmas list this upcoming year."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"The story of Jan Baalsrud may be the most extraordinary I have ever read...ever. This true account of a Norwegian British special forces solider in WWII and his survival of a botched secret mission is not only amazing, it is unbelievable.The story revolves around a 12 man covert mission to northern Norway, intended to knock out a remote Nazi position. A strange turn of events gives away their position, and all but one man (Baalsrud) is either killed or captured. Thus begins a long journey in harsh conditions to find freedom again in Sweden.I will not give away a lot of details, but this story is so intense and exciting that you will find yourself saying \\"No way!\\" only to read on and repeat the phrase. Jan survives such amazing circumstances on repeated occasions, showing the animalistic drive for survival that lives within the human spirit. He has help, as Norwegians grapple with sure death if they agree to even feed Jan. Even with this prospect looming, not one countryman turns him away. In a nation that did not play a large role in the war, this fact shows the love these people have for their country and their people. I am surprised that I have never heard of Jan's story. Most I have spoken to have never heard as well. There is even an annual march to commemorate this story, following Jan's footsteps to freedom.This book is well worth reading and reflecting on in comparison with our own comfortable lives. We live in a time of great wealth and comfort compared to these people. They had spirit beyond words and believed in a strong sense of companionship and support. Jan's story is not only amazing and breathtaking, but also life changing. You will never see the human spirit or your own place in the world the same. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves stories of heart and strength, or who needs a lifting up of their own. See how a man can lean on others and survive the most harsh offerings of nature in a tale you thought could only be found in fiction."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"This book starts off with a real Hollywood type beginning, a crew of Norwegians saboteurs attempting to implant themselves back into Nazi occupied Norway after receiving training in England. As the team is landing, the Germans capture or kill the whole team, except one escapee, Jan Baalsrud. Jan performs heroics to escape the initial ambush, scaling icy cliffs, while wounded and barefoot, swimming bays to elude German search parties. Jan's goal is to survive and escape to SwedenA non-fiction book can not twist stories the way Hollywood can. In this case the action is at the beginning. The remainder of the story is really the story of a frostbitten crippled man being stored in remote huts and ice caves, enduring the cold, while Norwegian patriots are scheming to provide him with food, transportation and safe passage to Sweden. The story of this hero's endurance becomes a little tedious. I did not find it a story of the ultimate endurance, but it is well worth reading. The lifestyle and landscape of small isolated fishing villages in Northern Norway during World War II is very interesting. The fact that Jan Baalrud was often stored with a sledge and some meager provisions in an ice cave for a week or two while his destiny was being planned by Nature's storms, German search parties and local villagers."},{"Title":"We Die Alone","review":"A classic survival adventure tale taking the reader through the frozen reaches of Norway and Sweden along with the cultural study of the Laps people of the far north.

It's the true account of the sole survivor of an insertion team in Norway during WW II. If I didn't know it was true, I'd say it was absurd- all of those things simply couldn't happen to someone in real life. But they did.After Jan and the team of which he was part were betrayed by a cowardly man who feared they might be undercover Gestapo agents, he was the only one to escape alive. All of the other Norwegians he encountered were more than willing to help him to the best of their ability, despite the danger to themselves and their families. I'd like to think I'd have the courage of those patriotic people. I know I'd never be able to match Jan's courage and powerful determination to live in spite of everything.This work demands the use of superlatives like incredible, amazing, remarkable, etc, but they all fall short.

Sawyer here delivers on his long-awaited promise to pursue such a line of enquiry with respect to the book of Isaiah. As he says, much that is of great interest to readers of Isaiah lies not in reconstructed philology or historical setting, but in its appropriation in music, art, and the general mythology of Christianity (e.g. the ox and the ass of the nativity scene; the suffering servant in the passion...). We can only hope that this might signal the beginning of the end of dry-as-dust and theologically thin commentaries on biblical books, and the beginning of a whole new approach to dialoging with ancient texts.

He presents a very strong and salient case for this providing examples from not only biblical scholarship but the arts as well as politics, etc. He certainly includes the historical critical results as players on the field, but does not limit the scope as they do to form and method to the exclusion of content.His research from such produces some amazing statements, e.g. \\"to underline the fact that many of the most familiar themes and quotations from the 'Fifth Gospel' owe that familiarity to their appearance already in early Christian scripture as much as to the Church's use of the original Book of Isaiah. They had already received their Christian meaning, in other words, almost before the Church came into existence.\\"It is hard to imagine another biblical book which had so much impact on the church and history as Isaiah, however, the author encourages works on these other books to be produced to test the hypothesis. The chapters in the book contribute the overview of Isaiah's impact not only in periods of church history, but also thematically and then categorically in impacting such as feminine theology, art, music, literature, historical quest, etc. This is well supplemented by 38 plates of art which is referred to as the examination progresses.Well written, researched and a delightful venture into this most fascinating Prophet whose prophecy certainly has enlivened usage diverse and abundant. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide To Spacetime","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to special relativity.

The 17 chapters cover different parts of the world (primarily Europe and Asia, and including the Middle East) to explore why such structures were needed, who build them, when, and what remains to be seen today. Hundreds of buildings are included, from the fascinating fortified churches of Transylvania to the fort-like religious buildings in parts of the Middle East. Religious strife and bickering led to many different architectural answers in the buildings put up and defended. While many were erected to defend Christianity, we also see here examples from Islam and the Himalayas. Fascinating---a veritable tour guide."},{"Title":"Castles of God: Fortified Religious Buildings of the World","review":"Just one quick note - despite being categorized by Amazon as \\"art/photography,\\" this book is more of a historical reference work.

But the actual location of the segment is vague - the tracer gives a reading over a wide arc. Their attempts to locate the segment are complicated by the situation on the moon: a gas refinery is harvesting the swamp's output, but is under siege from the Swampies, the original inhabitants of Delta Magna who have been relocated to this moon. Rumours of the arrival of gunrunner Rohm Dutt are causing much tension...The fifth story in the Key of Time sequence is a bit of a mixed bag. Originally written by Robert Holmes, one of the best writers in the series' history, it shows every sign of being a rather rushed job. Interestingly, the bare bones of this story were later reused by Mr. Holmes in the last Peter Davison Doctor Who story, 'The Caves of Androzani', to much better effect.Readers of this book are spared some of the poor (so-called) special effects that plague the video production of the story, however the adaptation by Terrance Dicks doesn't help rise this story out of its own mire."},{"Title":"La Fanciulla del West in Full Score","review":"This book contain the greatest Puccini\`s Opera la Fanciulla del West in full score.

Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic? Well, I think it is all of those and many more. The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se. It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition. All mankind. And all conditions. It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well. Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun. This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece. Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece. Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.If you like good literature, you'll love this book. If you like psychology, you'll love this book. If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book. Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words. Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try. Just pick up the book. Open it to any page. You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin. Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book. The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size. If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy. I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically. I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it. If not, make do with the one-volume. Just don't go without. That would be a terrible mistake.Be warned: this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting. Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book. And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"Of all the editions of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY that have ever been published, this may be the best for the general reader. The NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CLASSIC edition wisely reprints the great 1932 Everyman's Library edition, with its wonderful introduction by the noted bookman Holbrook Jackson. (Readers are advised to skim or skip the rather pretentious new introduction by William H. Gass.)Unlike the &quot;all-English&quot; edition referenced..., the Everyman/NYRBClassic edition gives the Latin tags as Burton scattered them through his work and translates each and every one, either in brackets immediately afterward, or (sometimes) in an endnote to each of the three volumes (now bound as one). I've tried to read the &quot;all-English&quot; edition, and it's disappointing, because it turns out that Burton wanted readers to read the Latin tags whether they could understand them or not. He included their syllables in the rhythm of his prose, so as you read this edition, you can almost hear him quote, then translate, then continue onward.No booklover should skip this one, and this is the edition to have."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it.

Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"The Anatomy of Melancholy may be a worthwhile read.

NYRB has reprinted the three volume Everyman's Library edition in a rather thick paperback. This is not the first time the three volume Everyman's Library edition has been reprinted in one volume. Everyman's Library had a one volume edition in the 1960's and Vintage had an edition in the 1970's, but these have been out of print for many years. Except for some minor changes such as a new introduction by William H. Gass, and the removal of the out-of-date select bibliography the NYRB edition is identical to the earlier reprints.There are disadvantages to this reprint. Perhaps the biggest is that this reprint does not take advantage or even acknowledge the 70 or so years of scholarship that has come and gone since it was published in 1932. In the 1990's Oxford University Press issued a multi-volume scholarly edition of the Anatomy but the price is prohibative for most readers. You should know that NYRB edition is still good as a reader's copy, but it is not a scholarly edition.Another problem is the editorial decision that Holbrook Jackson made to clear away Burton's anotations that were originally printed on the page, and moved them to the end of each partition. Instead of looking on the page for Burton's citations the reader is flipping back and forth to track them down. Burton sometimes has a great deal of fun in his marginal glosses, and you will miss them if you are not careful.A third problem is the index. If you wanted to find Burton's references to English writers such as More, Shakespeare, or Spenser you would be out of luck if you used the index in the NYRB edition, but you wouldn't be if you were reading Shilletto's 1893 edition. In that edition authors Burton quotes are listed and you have no trouble tracking most of them in Burton's Anatomy.These days I am more likely to read one of the 17th century editions of Burton's Anatomy or Shilletto's edition, but it is good to have Burton available again in a popular edition, even though this one is not ideal."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is handy and relatively cheap. It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author. The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics. His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as \\"Democritus Junior.\\" Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe. He was also sometimes called the \\"laughing philosopher\\" because of his wit.Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy. What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy. It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight. Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a treat for the modern reader. Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing. His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through. The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic.

A plausible translation of the title into modern terms would be &quot;A Study of Abnormal Psychology.&quot; The application of Scholastic methods to this topic --- so similar, and yet so different, from contemporary academic discourse --- creates a curious impression. He invokes astrology and theology in forming his psychology.But in fact, Burton uses this arcane subject to go off on a profound and lengthy meditation on the melancholies and misfortunes of life itself. The author, it seems, was easily distracted, and his distractions are our gain. The passages on the Melancholy of Scholars, and the Melancholy of Lovers, are themselves worthy of the price of admission.His prose is unlike anything before him or since him.

There is a deep psychological teaching that mixes itself with high spiritual principles, esoteric Christian Gnosticism in its raw form, and countless viels that keep such things hidden from the eyes of the average literary scholar... Why would Burton write in such a way? The same reason Dante did...But what is it that Burton is trying to show us, with his quotes from the Alchemical Master Galen and Latin stanzas?Why must we understand the \\"Anatomy of Meloncholy\\"? The anatomy of our own suffering and the suffering of the world...The Master M refers to Burton in his books of Occult Mysticism.For us, as common \\"modern westerners\\", to understand such esoteric psychology-and not have to learn Latin, Tibetan, Sanskrit or Chinese, we must study the books of SAMAEL AUN WEOR. He writes in such a way as to unveil those truly hidden mysteries: \\"Know thyself and thy shall Know the universe and all its Gods\\".Find the book of \\"Revolutionary Psychology\\" or \\"The Perfect Matrimony\\" by the said author. These books are amazing supplements to books like Burton's. These books give the western student a strong foundation in the psychological aspect of Occultism.

A true feast."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"Those who read Robert Burton's ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY for the first time most often do so as part of a course in 17th century English literature. And even then they wade gently through a few pages rather than simply plunging in and learning, perhaps for the first time, that words are more intoxicating than any drug could be. There is no melancholy in the book, at least not to the extent that one might think because of the title. Instead the intrepid reader finds that Burton has attempted what we now know to be the impossible: to master the sum total of human knowledge in one book. Astoundingly, Burton did not know that it was impossible, so he went ahead and tried anyway. He came damn near close to succeeding.Robert Burton was typical of many contemporaries, many of whom tried to be a master of all trades, but it was only he that came close. Burton's love of learning and his dry and droll wit excuse his failure to such an extent that we do not even care that he failed. Rather, we focus on his successful attempt to draw us into the magical world of knowledge for its own sake. His critics have been merciless in their snippets that TAOM is no more than a collection of informal and disorganized essays on man's dissatisfaction with the universe. They complain loudly of his wild abandon of Latinate phrases that pepper every paragraph or his frequent mention of obscure authorities that exist nowhere else save this book. Yet, I suggest that wild abandon has its charm too. If one considers his book as a very nearly unlimited number of paragraphs, each of which exists in its own self-contained universe, then that paragraph sheds light on the human condition itself. Human beings have eternally sought knowledge of the macro universe and its mirror, the microverse. It is only in such seemingly unwieldy tomes as TAOM that humanity may find answers. The beauty of Burton is that the effort to find Eternal Truth is worth the effort. One need not be a grad student of literature to know that."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"There have been recently some reviews complaining of shoddy paperback editions of this book, published cheaply and with many dubious errors, lacking translation of the Latin, etc. (These problems are due largely to the publishers' use of outdated or uncorrected texts.)

I have been involved with many editions of this work over the years, and have a couple of things to add to what's been so eloquently said. First, it's a reference book and not a novel, and therefore shouldn't be read in a continuous way. It becomes tedious and incomprehensible. Like grandma used to say: \\"Take small bites so you don't choke!\\" There are parts of it that are dated but much that is totally applicable today. Second, it is a book about society, and the hypocrisy of the way different people get treated:\\"A sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing necessary victuals but a great man in office may safely rob, pillage, and destroy, and be honored for good service, and no man had best find fault with him.\\" This prefigures much of Enlightenment thinking and can be seen to relate to Culturalist Analytic thinking, like the works of Karen Horney. Third, it is a historical contemporary look at the Jacobean age, and even the Elizabethan world. If you're interested in the cultural climate of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, here is an overview of what was known and opined by a scholar. One wonders how melancholic he really was (in the modern sense) since the preparation and writing of such a compendium certainly requires motivation and energy, not generally associated with chronic depression. I would suggest the Preface and the Digression of Air as fascinating views of knowledge in the early 17th century.

This for all of you autodidacts who love poring over your unabridged editions of the OED in search of abstruse verbal arcana and the history of obsolete verbiage (Ahem, I include myself in your number, of course.). This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one. The other aspect is rather more nebulous: What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned? The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot; But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were. &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot; And who knows exactly why it was penned? So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy (Bohn's popular library)","review":"Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated.

After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated.

Curious of what became of his former interviewees, in 2004 he decided to revisit his subjects for a \\"reunion tour\\". And so he met up with a variety of mostly oddball non-mainstream characters:* UFO believers, including a man who acts as a \\"channeling\\" medium for an alien named Korton (the book isn't titled THE CALL OF THE WEIRD for nothing)* Ike TURNER, still concerned about the bad publicity his divorce from Tina caused him and bragging about his sexual life(\\"You never had five or six women at one time?\\", Ike asked. \\"Hey, life passin' you by!\\" - p. 84)* porn industry people, including a nasty individual shooting particularly kinky films like (faked) rape porns* surviving ex-members of the doomsday cult \\"Heaven\`s Gate\\" - they left the cult before its members committed mass suicide* a prostitute called Hayley* a militia type community in Idaho called \\"Almost Heaven\\"* an elderly gentleman, member of the Christian Identity/white supremacy group Aryan Nations* an unsavory gangsta rapper* a \\"get rich quickly\\" motivation trainer conman (you have to pay several thousand dollars for seminars where you learn to believe in yourself)and* white pride twin girl band PRUSSIAN BLUE (Lamb and Lynx GAEDE, then 12 years old ) and their mother April, a very attractive white nationalist political activist and expert on homeschooling.It would be wrong to assume a light hearted look, several chapters (particularly the \\"Heaven\`s Gate\\" part) are quite downbeat. Not all of the subjects are likeable eccentrics, some are quite unsavory characters (like the whole gangsta rapper scene). THEROUX (who worked for Michael MOORE's TV NATION show) is also a man with ultra leftist political leanings (and it shows). Speaking of Michael MOORE - the part of the book, where THEROUX tries unsuccessfully to get an interview with the elusive motivation trainer conman reminded me of MOORE\`s ROGER & ME.I particularly liked how THEROUX had to grudgingly admit his sympathy for some of his interviewees (despite him hating their beliefs) - evident in his encounter with the Aryan Nation neo-Nazi, who goes out of his way to help THEROUX find his lost laptop computer. Conversely, THEROUX was frustrated with the gangsta rapper people (despite THEROUX being a fan of the music and having great interest in this topic); they did not like him because he has the wrong colour of skin.Admittedly the book is thought-provoking and full of insights (although I more often than not disagreed) and an interesting and thusly recommended read."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more had I not read another similar, more comprehensive, and better book just a few months ago.

And it seems that the British find a certain sense of humor in learning about the crazy (Colonists) Americans. Some ten years ago the author found a series of strange Americans and did a book and TV series about them.In this book he comes back to America to visit the people he had written about earlier. And boy did he find some strange ones. There's the UFO crowd, the porn movie makers, hookers at a brothel (a legal brothel in Nevada), militants in Idaho.Maybe it's because I've seen this sort of thing on the news too many times, but I found the people he visited to be rather sad. To go be weird at spring break is one thing. To still be doing the same things ten years later is not showing much growth in maturity. It's fascinating to read about them, and at the same time be glad that I missed at least a few of these phases in my life."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"This is a fairly easy read and the subject is quite interesting so it's overall worth a look.

Ike Turner is weird no doubt, but what about Michael Jackson or Prince? Where's a chapter on the Goth culture, or Pagean religious people? How about the Amish? Circus people? How about the eco terrorist groups or PETA?

Theroux revisits nazis, gangster rappers, legal prostitutes, UFOlogists, and other fringe groups in the same humanizing but honest way he did on television. Somehow he has the ability to interview people whose core beliefs he disagrees with by stating his own point of view without offending them (usually) and delving into the person behind the beliefs.If you're unfamiliar with Theroux's film work, I'd recommend checking it out before reading this book. I'm sure the book can still be enjoyed without the background context, but it will be better understood if you have already met the subjects and, most importantly, Theroux."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"In this book, written as a kind of 'expiation' for the sin of 'using' his 'subjects', Louis Theroux goes back to the scene of the crime - to find out what became of the peculiar people he met years before.The real appeal, though, is that it shines a pale light on what the author was really thinking while filming the series, beyond the goofy, naive enthusiasm which has come to be the trademark of his screen persona.If you enjoyed the Weird Weekends series, you will appreciate this short book."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"After spending a decade making documentaries about groups on the fringes of American society and culture, Louis Theroux decides to try and revisit his earlier subjects to see how they have fared in the intervening years. This book is an account of these follow-up visits to the margins of America, where he finds believers in UFOs and alien abductions, neo-Nazis, porn film-makers, gangsta rappers and self-help gurus, among others. Because his earlier documentaries haven't always portrayed these groups in an entirely favorable light, reconnecting with his earlier subjects isn't always easy, but for the most part, Theroux is surprisingly successful in reconnecting.This is a glimpse into the lives and beliefs of those people outside the mainstream of our society. It is a reminder that no matter how pervasive our prevailing culture might seem to be, there is likely to always be a small minority stubbornly resisting those ideas and ideals, preferring their own belief systems, no matter how illogical or unreasonable they might seem to outsiders. That Theroux is able to maintain cordial (and often friendly) relationships with those that he so clearly considers \\"weird\\" is somewhat remarkable, as is his ability to tell their stories with enough sympathy for the reader to gain some insights into these subcultures, if not a measure of empathy. It is a powerful reminder of just how diverse we are as a society."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"While the book is worthwhile to read on its own, I'd strongly recommend that people people view the televised initial encounters with these people before reading it. Many of them can be found on Youtube. Actually seeing \\"Korton\\" talk....you have to see it...hilarious. It really adds a lot to this addendum of what has happened to them. I've been a fan of his documentaries for a while, they are both humorous and interesting. He's a witty character whose interest in \\"different\\" subjects is something I find fascinating to see. It was an interesting change up to delve into his world of weirdness in a written format, and I hope there is more in the future."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"This is a great follow-up to Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends show. If you've never heard of him, I highly recommend watching all of his videos. He is funny, informative and a little goofy. A perfect combination for dealing with the off-beat weirdness of the myriad of fringe groups wandering around the US."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Louis Theroux's book defies Oscar Wilde's dictum that journalism is unreadable (and literature is never read), because it's exceedingly readable. Not only that, it offers nuanced, highly sympathetic portrayals of some characters you wouldn't normally expect to receive such treatment. It's not at all that Theroux agrees with people such as Jerry Gruidl, an adherent of the peculiarly American take on Nazism known as the Christian Identity movement, but by giving Gruidl a fair treatment and depicting him as a human being in all his complexity, Theroux gives us an opportunity to form our own conclusions--and that's an infinitely more interesting way to approach a subject like this.I first encountered Theroux in a documentary he did about the Westboro Baptist bunch--the ones who picket military funerals--and there, too, was impressed with the fact that he didn't talk down to us by telling us just how sick and offensive they are. We don't need that, assuming we're halfway intelligent; rather, let the subjects damn themselves--and that's exactly what Theroux did.Same here, only because it's a book, you get a lot more detail and insight than any film could offer. One of my favorite scenes was in the Gruidl chapter, when a deranged woman shouted down a group of Aryan Nations thugs with her own weirdly racist slogans, \\"demonstrating, perhaps, that the most effective antidote to the racist marchers wasn't rational argument but to be even crazier and more obscurely bigoted.\\"Great book, full of intelligent and often hilarious observations.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"As of today, April 1, 2007, this book is ranked over 100,000 at Amazon. Where are the readers? This is, so far, the best book I've read all year. Today is April 1, but I'm not joking.I read this book in one day, on a trip from Boston to Fairbanks, Alaska. This gave me the opportunity to literally take the book in as a whole. According to Theroux in the prologue, he covers four main sources of journalistic weirdness: sexual, racial, religious, and narcissistic. He interviews the types of poeple that most would consider \\"weird.\\" But for Theroux, the host of a popular British TV show, his motivation is different than the typical Jerry Springer variety. The interviewees and their entourage take a back stage to the way Theroux interacts with everyone and everything. Sometimes we detect empathy. Somethines we detect mild scorn. Always, Theroux humanizes his subjects while he exposes them. The methods are always subtle.Theroux's writing style is clean, crisp, using the right adjective or adverb when necessary. His quotes really bring his interviewees to life: Theroux is not afraid to keep local dialects or cultural or socio-economic related slang. The prose is polished.This is an excellent work of journalism, matching the quality of Gay Talese, Michael Lewis, or Malcolm Gladwell. It's too bad that this book isn't noticed more in the U.S. This book is as much a work of journalism as it is a work of psychology or sociology. There is work in them thar pages -- despite the crude subject matter, this is no fly-by-night piece of hack writing. Theroux asks the correct questions. He mixes a sophisticated sense or ironic humor with brief interludes of philosophic discourse, always reporting the facts without letting his personal opinions get in the way. (He does give his opinions, but they do not bias the text.) He commands a sophisticated vocabulary, maintaining a mature, elegant prose. His self-effacing writing style is fair to the reader.The most important conclusion of this book is taken from Theroux's Epilogue: \\"'Have you ever argued with a member of the Flat Earth Society?' a self-help guru named Ross Jeffries once asked me. 'It's completely futile, because fundamentally they don't care if something is true or false. To them, the measure of truth is how important it makes them feel. If telling the truth makes them feel important, then it's true. If telling the truth makes them feel ashamed and small, then it's false.' My experience on my trip has borne this out. On the list of qualities necessary to humans trying to make out way through life, truth scores fairly low...in the end, feeling alive is more important than telling the truth....We are instruments for feeling, faith, energy, emotion, significance, belief, but not really truth.\\"This last pragraph, my fellow readers, sums up Theroux's great book.\\""},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"The Call of the Weird is the first book offering from Louis Theroux, son of American travel writer and novelist, Paul Theroux. Formerly a writer for the satirical magazine, Spy and host of such celebrated U.K. television programs as Weird Weekends and When Louis Met, Louis Theroux offers a weirdly appealing jaunt through a number of subcultures that most Americans would choose to overlook completely. He shows little fear (or far less than most of us would, I venture) in engaging the likes of prostitutes, porn stars, alien killers, gangsta rappers, cult members, white supremacist folk singers, and even Ike Turner.Theroux sets off on his journey with a mind to revisit ten of his most memorable \\"ex interviewees\\" to see how their beliefs and subcultures might've shifted in light of changes in the world at large, or as he writes, \\"Clinton's American versus Bush's America; the nineties and the noughties.\\" What he finds is nothing short of...well...weird.In each chapter Theroux begins by setting the scene, recapping his first engagement with the subject at hand, and he always takes some time to analyze the changes (or lack thereof) in the people he's dealing with. Perhaps the most intriguing and engaging part of the book is Theroux's willingness to engage with some of the most intimidating or downright odd subcultures one might think of with a terrific amount of humility and humanity. While he might find himself stricken close to speechlessness by some of the tirades or actions his subjects engage in, he also does a fine job keeping judgments to a minimum and effectively communicating not only the \\"weird,\\" but the seemingly normal in all of us: the fervent anti-Semite's flying toaster screensaver, the porn star's happy marriage, Ike Turner's nostalgia.In one particularly telling instance Theroux writes:\\"Jerry's casual anti-Semitism was routine. Most of the time I ignored it, but I was aware of the unseemliness of having a virulent neo-Nazi as the contact person for my lost computer. I wondered if I could trust him--didn't the monstrousness of his beliefs suggest a fundamental dishonesty? But I was fairly sure I could rely on Jerry, and found it all the more odd that, for all his hatefulness, Jerry could also be thoughtful and decent.\\"Theroux's honest struggle with his personal beliefs in relation to the paradox of hatred and kindness so often present in his interviewees is what makes this book so very difficult to put down. I admired his candor and his bravery very much, and his willingness to present an even-handed account of his subjects in what are often such wildly disagreeable circumstances to the average person, no matter what part of the world he or she hales from.As he poignantly summarizes:\\"Though occasionally I'd been rebuffed by my old subjects, or shocked by their beliefs, and though I'd sometimes questioned my own motivations, in general I was more amazed by their willingness to put up with me a second time, and surprised by my affection for them. I'd been moved at times, and irritated, and upset, but the emotions had been real.\\"I suppose it is this impenetrable sense of reality that is at once unsettling and overwhelmingly attractive about The Call of the Weird, for it is certainly a very fine peek into the taboo and tantalizing in an often wholly unrepresented America."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Louis Theroux is an Oxford graduate and former writer for the satirical magazine \\"Spy\\" and for Michael Moore's award-winning \\"TV Nation,\\" as well as a former host of the BBC series \\"Weird Weekends\\" and son of American travel writer and novelist, Paul Theroux. The Call of the Weird is his first book, and it is a superlative work of journalistic effort.Ten years after hosting a BBC series on weird American subcultures, Theroux decided to follow up on and write a book about his interviewees.These are people most of us would want to avoid: Thor Templar, Lord Commander of the Earth Protectorate, who claims to have killed ten aliens (of the extraterrestrial rather than undocumented Latin American variety); April Gaede, a neo-Nazi mother bringing up twin daughters Lamb and Lynx, who form the \\"White Power\\" folk group Prussian Blue; Marshall Sylver, get-rich-quick guru, life coach and indicted fraudster; Oscody, nostalgic survivor of the suicidal Heaven's Gate cult and Jerry Gruidl, self-nominated fuhrer of the violently racist Aryan Nations organization - dreamers, schemers and outlaws all.Theroux attempts to discover what motivates people to believe outrageous things, what it means to be weird and to be oneself, and whether Americans have a peculiar propensity to believe in the unbelievable.Theroux's subjects include UFO enthusiasts, porn stars, white supremacists, brothel prostitutes, gangsta rappers, and, strangely, Ike Turner. Theroux gravitates to them because he believes - and attempts to document - their use of weirdness to feel \\"alive,\\" and that's \\"more important than telling the truth.\\"Theroux is pointedly (and poignantly) asked by one contact, \\"Have you ever argued with a member of the Flat Earth Society? ... it's completely futile, because fundamentally they don't care if something is true or false. To them, the measure of truth is how important it makes them feel. If telling the truth makes them feel important, then it's true. If telling the truth makes them feel ashamed and small, then it's false.\\"Theroux's writing is clean, clear and tight and his interviewing style is wonderfuly textured and illustrative, bringing his subjects to life, keeping local dialects and cultural or socio-economic related slang in place to vivid effect.\\"Call of the Weird\\" is a wonderful psycho-social travel essay, a \\"Passport to Adventure\\" that allows us a peek at what's happening at the margins of civil society out between and beyond the boundaries of the inappropriate, the bizarre, the macabre and the truly grotesque."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"\\"The Call of the Weird\\" is so far documentary maker Louis Theroux's one and only book. He wrote it after finishing his series \\"Weird Weekends\\" for BBC2, which was a documentary series on subcultures (whether political, commercial, sports or whatever else). The format of the series was that Theroux would visit the centers of the subculture, participate in it to immerse himself, and as much as possible let the practitioners speak for themselves without moralizing about them, but nonetheless in so doing revealing the odd and quirky aspects of the human personality and drive. The series has generally been extremely well-received, and deservedly so, not in the last place because of Theroux's own shy, nerdy and somewhat self-effacing personality and the friendly integrity of his approach in talking to people who are in one way or the other outside the mainstream. The occasion for this book was Theroux's worry that he nonetheless may have made a manipulative or abusive impression to the people he interviewed, even when he legitimately befriended them (like the porn star J.J. Michaels). To assuage his fears and to see what became of the people from the series, he revisits many of the most colorful characters again but without a camera, instead writing down his experiences in this book.Unfortunately, the book isn't nearly as interesting as the series. While the quirky figures are still there, Theroux has very little to add to what he already presented about them in the television programs. Moreover, none of the people involved really seem to have worried as much about the impact of his program as Theroux himself did, and few of them in fact even seem to care (or when they do, they perceived it generally negatively but not because of him). Louis Theroux himself seems constantly ill at ease in his second trip, and the format of a book puts him more in the center of things and his interviewees more in the background, which defeats the original purpose. Finally, while there are some interesting and insightful bits, such as his interviews in the white power movement, in most cases the lives of the people concerned are more sad and unfulfilling than amusing. So while it is fun to read some more about some of the favorite personalities from the original series and to read more about the antics they get up to, generally this book can't be considered a success."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Anybody considering this book should definitely see at least a few of Louis Theroux's BBC documentaries before reading the book, which tells what the author discovered upon revisiting some of his former subjects years after filming them. (Some of the earlier Amazon reviews of the book spell out who the subjects are, so I won't repeat that info here.) Theroux spends a fair bit of time recounting his initial encounters with these folks--essentially, summarizing the relevant portion of the film in which they were featured--then provides an account of what he found when he went looking for them again minus the camera crew, in what seems to be 2004 or 2005. The prose is very readable and often funny, but while the writing style is breezy, the book does contain an undercurrent of sadness and more than a little ugliness (as one might expect when visiting fanatical racists). Much as I enjoyed the book, I found it slightly disappointing: I had hoped that Theroux would use the book to expand upon his subjects and his own ideas in ways that are more detailed and intellectually developed than the format of a TV show allows. He takes a few steps in those directions, but overall the book is quite a lot like the narration and dialogue from his films, minus the visual information. As such, I think the book is ultimately less rewarding than his films--more of a supplement to them than a fully developed work on its own terms--but the book is still a real pleasure, and I recommend it to all who are intrigued by his films."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Vonnegut type craziness plus television's version of reality gives this book a chance to define what is really weird from UFO cults to gurus to drug-crazed musicians"},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Fans of Louis Theroux's award winning television series \`Weird Weekends' should certainly seek out this read. Louis returns to some of the more interesting characters from the programme to see if/how their lives have changed since the filming of the series.His subsequent experiences make for compelling reading. However, anyone expecting a humourous read in the style of the TV shows should be warned, I found reading about these people and the way their lives had changed, a far more solemn experience than I had expected. Many of the people featured have fallen upon hard times, and the book presents a stark contrast from the television programmes where, by and large, events are far more positive. I was left feeling quite sad, lamenting the manner in which many of the featured individuals' lives have turned sour.Nevertheless, the aforementioned discussion of the direction and details of the book are in no way an indictment of its contents . Far from it; I couldn't put it down! It's more that the enjoyment derived is of a different variety from that found in the television companion to the tome."},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"Americans who haven't seen the excellent deadpan documentaries by Louis Theroux can still appreciate his dry yet sympathetic humor through this book. He tracks down his ex-interviewees for another round, from porn stars to gangsta rappers to prostitutes, UFO enthusiasts and neo-Nazis, including a mother who has encouraged her twin daughters to form a white power band called Prussian Blue. When she asks them if they're hungry, she suggests tossing a Jew in the oven. Louis Theroux is able to communicate with all kinds of people on the fringes of society while resisting the temptation to punch their lights out, but also speaking his mind when their views become intolerable. My only question is whether the book should be called \\"The Call of the Weird\\" or \\"The Call of the Pathetic\\". Surely there must be some weird people out there that Louis could interview, who actually have some positive achievements!"},{"Title":"Call Of The Weird (CD)","review":"The book arrived within its speculated time and in its prime condition!

This book was easy to read, but I didn't find it fascinating."},{"Title":"Democracy and social ethics","review":"Hull House founder and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams spent twenty years working with the poverty-stricken immigrant poor in Chicago. She writes here with understated passion and unqualified empathy for their plight.Anyone who wants to know why we have a fourty hour work should read this book. Addams writes about the desirablity of factory work over household work for young women, due both to the lack of isolation and the relatively short working hours, \\"only\\" from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week.Anyone who wants to know why we minimum wage laws, social security disability laws, age discrimination laws, social security laws, welfare laws, etc. should read this book. Addams writes about people earning pennies an hour, having their peak earning years in their twenties, being disabled in their thirties, and being dependent on children for financial support. The children, in turn had their education stop before high school so they can support their families.Anyone who wants to know why governments spend so much money on education should read this book. Addams writes about children having a choose limited to factory employment or household service, with the more intellectually oriented being doomed to spend a lifetime haunting public libraries and public lectures, but having virtually no chance of escaping the circumstance of their birth.Anyone who wants to know why poverty-stricken people are suspicious of political reform movements should read this book. Addams writes about the major efforts Chicago's political powerhouses made to help individual poverty-stricken people, and the irrelevance of wisdom advocating personal savings to people who could not pay for food for their family, or of wisdom urging them to stay out of taverns when they were a great source of personal help and friendship.One hundred and five years after Addams wrote this book, the United States is a far better place to live than it was then. But our country's improvements, urged by great progressive leaders like Addams, are under relentless right-wing assaults today. This book is extremely relevant to our country's future, if our future is going to continue to better than our past.The introduction of Charlene Haddock Seigfried, the past president of the Society for the Advancement of American philosophy, adds a great deal to this work, as it places Addams and her fellow reformers into the context of both their times and the prevailing systems of thought.Addams saw democracy as a way of life, and not just a series of electoral choices. She sought a major expansion of municipal services, to both improve the living standards of the desperately poor and to wean them away from dependence on corrupt political machines. She advocated the existence of \\"A reformer who really knew the people and their great human needs, who believed it was the business of government to serve them, and who further recognized the educative power of a sense of responsibility....\\"Addams addresses this book to the philanthropic community which provided the base of her financial support. She clearly saw them as providing seed money for demonstration projects to create greater governmental and societal commitment.It is fashionable in some quarters to say that nothing has been done and nothing can be done to improve the plight of the poverty-stricken. Anyone who believes that, or must deal with others who believe that, should read and quote liberally from this book."},{"Title":"Democracy and social ethics","review":"Jane Addams proceeds democracy into every aspect of life.

Its authors-Sidney Mintz and Richard Price-feared that, with the \`explosion' of general interest in Black History, ideological concerns might sidetrack the invaluable \`scholarly quest' previously established by the likes of W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston (in the U.S.A.) Jean Price-Mars (in Haiti) or Fernando Ortiz (in Cuba) to name a few. Therefore, 'The Birth of African-American Culture' cautiously offers strategies/approaches to study the Afro-American past that would do justice to the complexity of the subject. Its central thesis, supported both by documentary material and speculation, is straightforward: continuities between the so-called \`Old' and \`New' Worlds must be established on a comprehension of the \`basic conditions' under which the migrations of \`enslaved Africans' took place.Today, that the analysis of the development of Afro-American culture should focus on \`process' is no longer an issue; the works of renowned scholars such as Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Lawrence W. Levine are a testimony to it. In a sense, these academics vindicate Mintz and Price who, two decades earlier, have emphasised the need for more analytical subtlety, flexibility, and sound socio-historical research in Afro-American Studies. What is more, Mintz and Price are aware of the book's achievement, even though, in its 1992 re-edition, caution is still strong in the way they reassert their belief in a two decade-old thesis. For example, in the new preface, Mintz and Price repeat that the unavoidable fact in the study of Afro-America is \`the humanity of the oppressed, and the inhumanity of the systems that oppressed them.' Both believe that such oppression \`has by no means ended should be clear to everyone, as it is to us.'The text of 'The Birth of African-American Culture', including introduction and conclusion, is eighty-five pages long; yet amazingly it covers a broad range of complex issues focused on slave society, from the origins and beginnings of Afro-American societies and cultures to questions of kinship and sex roles therein. In their rigorously balanced, albeit too tentative at times, analysis of Afro-American Culture the authors rightfully argue that the transfer of culture intact from Africa to the Americas is more fiction than reality. Mintz and Price believe that \`Retentions' and \`Survivals' are more the exception than the rule in any group's transport of beliefs and values from one locale to another (Europeans included).The Birth of African-American Culture is thought provoking; it is still very useful in the scholarship on slavery, and issues of the origins and development of Afro-American culture. It is also a must-read for those Africans who refuse to be carelessly melted in the pot of global Blackness. Because of never-ending and multifaceted oppression, contemporary Africans and Afro-Americans still need to negotiate an awful number of complex issues before being \`brothers' and \`sisters': it has been so for centuries despite the numerous bonds that (do) exist between members of the Black Diaspora. Like Mintz and Price, it is my profound conviction that \`the nature of oppression, while obvious in its most familiar forms, involves subtleties as well, one of these being the way it divides and confuses honest [souls] by perpetuating suspicion and fear.' However, in its future editions, 'The Birth of African-American Culture''s authors need to:(1) Go beyond offering startegies/approaches to the study of the Afro-American past, and present results of such studies, albeit selectively, if only to corroborate and strengthen their own thesis/be bolder in their arguments. I believe that Mintz and Price missed this opportunity two decades after the first publication of their book but, still, it can be done;(2) Spend time to explain to the reader how \`Caribbeanist' scholars like themselves can write about (Afro-) \`American' culture. In other words the intertwined issues of what \`America' is, what \`Americans' are and how they relate to the subject matter of 'The Birth of African-American Culture' must be tackled in much detail and clarity."},{"Title":"The Birth of African-American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective","review":"Even though I am versed in the topic, I am not a social scientist.

Loosely organized by chapter into various topics, it touches upon such subjects as what makes a \\"true\\" Roman (it's more than just living there), the impossibly temperamental system of government, the vagaries of historically categorizing Roman places, people, and events, and the joys of wandering Trastevere, one of the oldest and most representative of Rome's many neighborhoods. Romangnoli probably never intended this collection to be either guidebook or memoir, simply the setting down on paper of his thoughts and impressions of a place he knows well and loves dearly.

Romagnoli, now in his 70s, grew up in Rome, leaving it for America some 50 years earlier with his American wife. As this book begins, the widowed Romagnoli, newly re-married to another American, is returning to Rome to re-establish his ties.During the tax ride from the airport, Romagnoli considers the concept of \\"native\\". He was born in Rome, but that doesn't qualify him as truly Roman. To be truly Roman, all ancestors to 7 generations back must have been born and lived in Rome. While his mother was a Roman, his father was a \\"pellegrino,\\" an immigrant from the North. The taxi driver points out some of the more recent pellegrinos they pass on the way to Romagnoli's rented flat. This is a suitable introduction to the book-rather than focus on the sights or manners of the Romans, Romagnoli considers broad topics of special import to Italians. In each subsequent chapter, he takes up a different topic in turn, such as government, health care, the fountains, religion, and transportation. But he develops each of these topics from his experiences on this particular trip.

So as a reference book it's indispensable, despite the fact that it's literary style lacks fluency. As always with [semi-] scientific writings on anything Tibetan, the text is interspersed with Tibetan and Sanskrit phonetics which tend to become tiresome after a while.

She flies over the forest in search of a suitably solitary spot, and comes across a helpful gentleman dressed in tweed, reading 'The Sporting Times'. He is a fox, and invites her to make use of his summer residence, in particular the shed carpeted with the feathers of previous victims. Dazzled by his good breeding, Jemima accepts his offer and visits daily. When the eggs are about to hatch, Foxy suggests she bring along various goodies so they can have a charming goodbye party...The unremitting violence in this story does not emanate from where you'd expect, and this clear-eyed vision of the natural order of things, of brute force vs. cunning, takes place in the most idyllic setting yuou can think of, a richly detailed rural England, its hills and plants alive and painted in the most soothing colours. But even this balmy backdrop plays out a cycle of struggle for domination, with spiders eating flies, and various other creatures being horrid to one another.Written at the turn of the 20th century, just before female emancipation, it's hard not to see the woebegotten Jemima as an image of women's fate in a world run by men, both good and bad, with the fox as parisitic aristo in straitened circumstances, and the dog as paternalistic liberal. Indeed, the whole thing plays like an Emile Zola potboiler disguised as toddler fodder. Upsetting, cruel and marvellous."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"This IS the story of Jemima Puddleduck, and it can be read to children. It loses a lot of its interest value without the pictures, but the story is still good."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first Beatrix Potter book I read when I was young. It is the tale of a barnyard duck named Jemima who wishes to hatch her own eggs instead of leaving the task to the hens. She decides to leave and find a place to nest and encounters a polite gentleman with sandy whiskers who so kindly offers his help. It is a charming tale, as so many of Ms. Potter's stories are, complete with an endearing if not somewhat naive duck, a handsome yet sly fox and a wise old collie dog. The illustrations are quite nice, with some beautiful countryside scenes of Sawrey where the author lived. This story is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK is one of Beatrix Potter's lesser known tales, but it is still a favorite in our house. Jemima is a duck who wishes to hatch her own eggs. Apparently it is common on farms for hens to sit on duck eggs. Ducks in general, and Miss Jemima in particular, do not have the patience to sit on a nest for 28 days, so farmers transfer the eggs to hens. Jemima, however, is quite determined to hatch her own brood, and searches for a calm, quiet place to do so. In a secluded clearing, she meets an elegantly dressed gentleman with a long bushy tail, who is reading a newspaper. Jemima thinks he is mighty civil and handsome, and he is very solicitous of her plight. Jemima takes the sandy colored gentleman up on his offer of a safe, dry place to hatch her eggs. But there is more to this gentleman than meets the eye. Is he really as selfless as he seems?THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK quietly and deftly teaches children to be wary of strangers. This simple tale completely captures the imagination of young ones as they follow Jemima on her misadventures. As always, it is Ms. Potter's charming illustrations that are the true star of this book. Jemima looks like a real duck, albeit one who is wearing a bonnet and cape. The soft colors and rich detail of the original drawings continue to delight children of all ages.My three year old has a special affinity to THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK. Whenever the story refers to Jemima's sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebecca Puddle-duck, my wee one says, \\"That's me, Momma!\\" Any book that captures the imagination of my little puddle-duck is a winner with me."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"I recognize that this is a classic, and can be weighed on its literary merit in that regard. From the perspective of women's history and the allegories in the story-- fine.However, this is a brutal story. The tragedy of the mother-figure losing all of her eggs to dogs, and then only being allowed to keep some of her second set of eggs is deeply disturbing to both kids and potentially adult readers. There is enough real-world tragedy without adding this story into the mix for leisure reading. Better to discuss those realities with kids, when they are old enough, than to introduce a brutal read disguised as an animal story."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"I thought this was such a horrible book. So the duck runs away, shacks up with a fox who is going to eat her eggs. The duck tells a dog who brings his puppies to \\"save\\" the duck and her eggs. They kill the fox and then eat her eggs.

There's something appealing about the ditzy Duck and her adventure with the sly, charming and untrustworthy Fox. Something very organic, particularly when you add the wonderful saving graces of the dog, and Potter's steady scrutinizing eye and prose. Her pace is impeccable.I must say, the negative reviews shock me! Whatever must you think of Grimm's tales?Silly, feckless Jemima is merely a slice of real life, the way life used to be. I adore her for it.Once Upon a Time, most people lived on farms, and so the idea that a duck might not sit her nest (they don't sometimes) or that she and her eggs were in danger from foxes was as familiar to children as moronic video games and the TV shooter are to today's \\"natural-world\\"-impoverished children.Chuck the TV shooter.Read the kids Jemima.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck","review":"I was disappointed by the reviews left for this book in its various formats. But at $1.50 bargain book, I figured how bad could it be? The sounds were different but catchy, my kids liked them (they were short songs rather than sound effects for the most part). My book came with 6 sounds, the picture here says it comes with 5. The book was of good quality but the sound effects buttons were hard for my kids to press (I had no problem myself).The story itself was only so-so but wasn't as bad as others made it out to be. In short, a duck wants to lay her eggs in private. A fox offers his hut. She lays eggs and he suggests she gather some herbs so that they can have dinner to celebrate. The duck mentions it to the farm dogs who are suspicious and follow her to the hut where they chase away the dog. Yes, I suppose the story goes that a fox tricks the duck into leaving her brood unattended so that he can eat her eggs. But this is never shown and not alluded to much (there was no picture of an empty nest or anything like that) so my kids totally missed what some parents picked up on. Also, the farm dogs do not then kill the fox as some mistakenly say. The text says that the fox was \\"never seen again\\" and the picture shows the dogs chasing the fox away. My kids thought it meant that the fox wanted to eat the duck but the dogs scared it away - happy ending and everyone was satisfied. For $10 or more this book may not be worth it.

High adventure of the old type. The journey was intended to demonstrate the possibility of transoceanic vaoyages in ancient times, using the most primitive of crafts. He proved his point, in the most direct way possible.But as well as being a daring adventurer, Heyerdahl was a master story-teller, and he enthralls his readers with accounts of the ancient legends of Peru; of the Virachochas, led by Kon Tiki, who were said to have fled from their Andean homeland westwards across the ocean. We hear of the ancient and mysterious ruins around Lake Titicaca, which the Incas told the Spaniards had been built by the Viracochas. These people were said to have been a white-skinned race which had originated far to the north and west.In subsequent years Heyerdahl traced the origin of the Viracochas and the other \\"white\\" Indians of the Americas to the Atlas region of North Africa; and he demonstrated, in the Ra expedition, how ancient sailors from that region could have crossed the Atlantic to reach the Americas.Before he died, Heyerdahl had the satisfaction of seeing everyhting he said fully vidicated by science. To start with, in the early 1990s a forensic toxicology team in Germany, led by Dr Svetlana Balabanova, discovered traces of tobacco and cocaine, two American narcotics, in an Egyptian mummy. After repeated the tests many times, and examining other mummies, they found the same thing again and again.In the meantime, it has become clear that a whole host of American drugs (such as the notorious jimson weed) were known in the Old World in ancient times, and used in the various Mystery Cults to provide initiates with out-of-body experiences. Almost all of this knowledge was suppressed in Europe and the Middle East, where Christianity and Islam took a dim view of such things. It was preserved, however, in the Sanskrit literature of India.A little later in the 1990s an American team of geneticists dicovered a type of European/Middle Eastern mitochondrial DNA (the x haplogroup) in Native American populations. Again, after checking and rechecking for errors, they published their findings. And the percentage of this Old World DNA was highest in groups of Native Americans that were traditionally known as \\"white,\\" such as the Ojibbewa in North America and the Yanomamo in South America.When this is added to the clear evidence that Clovis Man was essentially Caucasian (as Kennewick Man has shown), then there's no doubt that Heyerdahl was right. But how long will it be before this is recognised, and Heyerdahl gets the academic recognition he deserves?"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I recently saw a list of bestsellers from my birth year of 1951. Kon Tiki had been #1 throughout most of that year so, out of curiosity, I bought it. It has opened an entire new world to me! Adventure, culture, bravery, aquatic life, and so on! The best book I have read in years!!! Mr. Heyerdahl writes like he is just talking to you in your living room, so down to earth and very entertaining in his calm, methodical approach to situations most of us would run screaming from! I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old! It is a classic. My dream is to one day travel to the Kon Tiki Museum in Oslo and actually see that magnificent raft. Read this book! You will never forget it."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Heyerdahl was either extremely ignorant of the sea, completely sure of his hypothesis that ancient peoples traveled the sea in rafts, or both.I worked offshore, and couldn't imagine doing what Heyerdahl did. I've spent my life on the water and the sea just has never been so forgiving in my case. To build a raft for the first time without testing it first against the sea was just madness. But to put out, without the technology we have today, that was just ballsy.In the end, history proved him right, over and over again. Heyerdahl is a man who certainly knows how to put his money where his mouth is. If you want to know about the spirit of those who have the faith to really lean on their convictions, this is a great book.-H"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I was very pleased that I stumbled across this book and thoroughly recommend it. In terms of history and the movement of people the book is very important. The idea that the Polynesian islands were populated solely from Asia had to be re-thought after this unbelieveable journey was made, even history books had to be re-written. Before the incredible journey was taken not many poeple thought it possible that a raft could leave the west coast of S.America and reach the polynesian islands solely by nature alone ie current and wind. Most people excepted what scientists wrote ,that is the polynesian islands were populated from the west side of the Pacific(asia)only and no native South Ameicans could have made such a journey especially before technology came into play. But these men had done there homework on sea currents,weather patterns(winds) and construction of the raft, which was constructed using the same materials as they had used in inca times.If you want an insight into how ancient peoples risked everything by sailing into the unknown this is the book for you,its compelling stuff."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Kon Tiki is one of the best books I have ever read.

Read Kon Tiki, and experience the wonders of primitive sea travel."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"An exciting book by a brave and gifted man, who, in the 1940s, sought to prove his theories that settlers of ancient Easter Island (the most isolated land on earth) might have come from South America. He did so by setting sail on a balsa raft from Peru and going thousands of miles into the Pacific, with a small crew of friends in a remarkable adventure. Heyerdahl was a genius to realize that ancient man need not have been hindered by oceans, which in fact could have acted more like conveyer belts than barriers. (I also recommend his books about the Ra expeditions in reed rafts from Africa to America.) The success of the Kon Tiki mission was a bold and evocative backing up of this general theory, though he also offers other kinds of fascinating evidence along the way. (By the way, I always grit my teeth when I hear modern scientists trying to discredit Heyerdahl by asserting that today's Easter Islanders are Polynesians who came from farther west, which isn't in doubt and wan't to Heyerdahl either. But they are not reading him closely - he suggested an *earlier* migration from South America, which was replaced by Polynesians later on. Perhaps Easter Island was settled twice.) Anyway, a good sea yarn and one of the world's rare radically eye-opening books."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens, and I'm happy to see that it has been reprinted. Although I always preferred to read fiction over nonfiction, for some reason I picked this book up and began to read -- and I couldn't put it down. I found great excitement in the real-life adventure of Heyerdahl and his crew building a raft in Peru, then sailing the Pacific in order to prove that people from South America could have sailed to and settled Polynesia long ago. The details of building the draft and getting it to the ocean make the book come alive, as do the details of being on the ocean on nothing bigger than a raft held together with ropes and vines. A wonderful true-life adventure story."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I have read this book several times over the years.

I recommend it for anyone who sits on the tip of the adventure chair."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Besides being an excellent explorer, the author is an excellent story-teller. He start his narration telling the difficulties of having his studies accepted by scholars. They doubt his theory on the South American natives being the ones to populate the Polynesian islands, because they thought it was impossible for them to reach the islands using just a small raft.That triggered the desire for the author to prove himself right. He started looking for ways of doing this travel, finding crew and financial resources. After solving the financial problems through the sponsor of people from the explorer's club in New York, he start traveling multiple times to Washington to get licenses and approval for using military food and he find his first travelmate, Herman Watzinger. They are joined by Knut Haugland, Bengt E.Danielssen, Erik Hesselberg and Torstein Raaby. The book describes this incredible and marvelous journey taken by six people (five Norwegians and one Sweden) through the Pacific Ocean. Some photos taken by the author are presented in the book. This book shows how much courage those guys needed to have to expose themselves to the wind, the rain, the lack of comfort, and the risk of death just to prove a theory.This book is more than just a traveller's journal. It is a masterpiece and it should be in the permanent library of any serious reader."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I had read Kon-Tiki as a boy and enjoyed the adventure.

It might be old, but it is good."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Although with my luck it would probably sink.Heyerdahl was one of the last great adventurers of our time, and his memoir 'Kon Tiki' is a testimonial of his trials before during and after his grand expedition accross the Pacific. In true adventure fashion he leaves no detail ignored, from the building of the raft, to the opposition he encountered to the myriad of marine life he encountered on the way to the polynesian islands.The reading can be a bit dry at times, but in the end it's worth it. Because when he finally strikes dry land you feel like you've been on the boat with him the whole time and not reading his adventures 50+ years after the fact."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"From the opening sentence to the final period, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is a page-turner.The story is absurd on its face: One man, obsessed with the idea that the Polynesian islands were colonized by voyagers from South America, can't get anybody to take his theory seriously. \\"They didn't have proper boats,\\" was the argument.Heyerdahl insisted that the colonists had set forth on balsawood rafts. This assertion was met with derision.To prove his theory, Heyerdahl decided to do it himself: to sail from the coast of Peru roughly 4,000 miles to Polynesia. The story of how he assembled a crew of like-minded fools, put together his unlikely craft, and made the incredible journey reads like the best of fiction.Heyerdahl never bogs down the reader with pointless minutia, but he nevertheless treats the reader to details that make the story come to life: the phosporescent plankton, the daily breakfast of flying fish picked up off the deck every morning, the tiny crab who became a pet of the crew. And he doesn't stint on adventure, from the man nearly lost at sea to the harrowing wrecking of the raft on the reefs.\\"Kon-Tiki\\" is simply a great story, engrossing even to those not usually given to reading survival stories."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Wow!

It was always his favoite, and I remember seeing it in his bookcase when I was a child. I stumbled upon an old first edition, like my Dad's in a bookstore, bought it, and read it in two days. This book is so good -- and so astonishing -- that it reads more exciting than any fiction that I've ever read. This is a great story for anyone yearning for adventure. These six men, alone on a hand-made balsa raft, adrift in the pacific -- by their choice! Just to prove the validity of a theory. What makes this account so astounding is the conviction these men had in their belief and their willingness to risk everything--including their own lives.

Yesterday I picked up this book, by chance, in a store and could not put it down. I bought it, read it last night and realized that this was one of those books that had been read to me so long ago. It's funny to think this, but looking back on it I realize that I always believed the story to be fiction. Nothing like this could ever really happen!...but it DID happen, and not too long ago either. Last night I sat down with this book and could not put it down until it was finished. You are drawn into the planning of the expedition, the day-to-day life of the crew and, by the end of the book, you feel as though you were ON the Kon-Tiki with these six men. You reach the end of the book and instantly crave another adventure, or another thousand pages. I would be doing this book an injustice by trying to explain the feeling it gives the reader, but to say that it has effortlessly toppled every notion I ever had about what makes a &quot;good&quot; book would be very accurate indeed. A must read--for anyone of any age in any country."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"In this classic, Heyerdahl constructs a raft to sail 4,300 nautical miles from Peru to the South Pacific Islands in order to prove his theory that the natives of Peru could have migrated to these islands thousands of years ago. This book contains a great deal of information of interest to scientists. These include the appearance of previously little-known fish, the scope of marine bioluminescense, the deployment of ocean currents, etc. It is interesting to note that the Polynesians realized that the Earth was round. A re-examination of the common belief that prescientific peoples invariably believed in a flat Earth is clearly warranted."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"This book is for the voyeur that wants a window into the lost age of adventure, those years before 1940. The book is rightly regarded as one of the greatest accounts of real life adventures ever written. It paints exhilarating, vivid pictures of risk taking, and of the human hunger for adventure and desire to return to experiencing life through ones primal instincts. This book is about survival, a chase, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It sets The Sea against Man, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against independent, irreverent, defiant thinkers. Reading about the author's 4,000-mile journey across huge expanses of treacherous ocean brings out the would-be adventurer in the reader. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination against all odds and in the face of nay saying experts (who condemned the journey from the start as foolish, and said their voyage never would or could succeed), sets an inspiring example of how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what self-appointed experts and nay Sayers declare impossible. During their voyage the author and his team pushed the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. The author in part wants us to understand that not all seemingly adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across barren, stormy oceans, be they real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its heed, to push ones own limits to their edge. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. The ultimate reward of this book is that it can reawaken in the reader a primal instinct to pursue, instincts which often seems irrelevant or far away in our modern, comfortable lives... this book also reminds the reader of how to dream and the virtues of following dreams. The book serves to remind us of how, why, and where to find adventure ... personally, I walked away from the book exhilarated, and convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars. ***** Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"The theory suggested by Thor Heyerdahl that the islands of Polynesia were settled from sea-faring travelers from South America has been doubly disproved by both language and DNA. So why read this old book copyrighted in 1950?For the sheer adventure of it. Never has an escape from the war-torn modern world come at a greater seductive appeal than in KON TIKI: Across the Pacific by Raft.Crewed by five nutty Norwegians and one brave Swede, Kon Tiki is built from giant balsa trees freshly felled in in the forests at the foothills of the Andes and floated down the river to a naval yard on the coast of Peru. Surrounded by modern warships, the logs are lashed together with rope and a deck and cabin of plaited bamboo is added. Towed out to sea, the strange little craft and crew (six men and one parrot)is caught in the cold Humboldt Current and taken north, then the sail fills with the tradewind and it is swept east toward the islands.Sadly, after two months, the parrot is washed overboard. The remaining crew (six men) learn that the steering watch must wear a safety rope, that it is possible to catch sharks by hand and that the easiest way to make breakfast is to gather up all the flying fish that have jumped on board overnight. The grainy black and white photographs alone are enough to start the reader on a reverie of escaping to Tahiti. This is beach reading of the most dangerous sort!But aside from the sheer adventure, an important point was made by Thor Heyerdahl's voyage. In our modern era we are so impressed with our own technology that it is easy to lose sight of how clever our \\"primitive\\" ancestors were. Heyerdahl built a boat from ancient descriptions and discovered halfway through the voyage that it had a sophisticated steering mechanism which he didn't use since wind and current were taking him in the right direction. Kon Tiki could have made landfall sooner had he aimed for nearer islands. That this remarkable craft survived contact with a reef that had ripped up more modern boats shows that even amateurs could arrive safely. One wonders what the original builders of such crafts could do?"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"As a youngster, I saw the documentary of this amazing story and was thrilled from the start. Soon thereafter, I read this book entirely in three days, completely enthralled in the narrative. Dr. Heyerdahl had proven his skeptics wrong, demonstrating how an early civilization (in this case, the Native Americans of Peru) could cross the Pacific on a raft to populate what is today Polynesia. Based on the Peruvian legend of the hero Kon-Tiki (later deified) who successfully built and sailed a similar raft many centuries ago.I have since read other Heyerdahl authored works, including &quot;Fatu-Hiva&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku.&quot; Although they too are extremely rousing, I personally feel a greater spirit of adventure in this story, hence it is my favorite.As mentioned in the title, there is one sad commentary to make: on the day of writing this review (4/18/02), I learned that Dr. Heyerdahl died of a brain tumor at age 87. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Forget idiotic movies like 'Jaws,' these Scandanavian maniacs grab sharks by the tail and kill them for fun.

Not Thor and his band of merry men; they were theoretically convinced and determined to put their tails on the line to prove it. I have never read anything in my life so full of intensity, danger and heroic, romantic adventure.

It's also a great travel epic complete with the quirky locals, the gadget guru, and a group of men willing to risk their lives for an ultimate adventure.Parts of the book did read like a 1960's documentary. I could almost envision the \\"exciting world of color\\" technicolor intro and Thor narrating over the action. But I think it all adds to the ambiance of the book. It makes you realize in days before GPS and sattellite radios how crazy this band of pioneers really were. Also Thor doesn't really get into the emotional implications of first signing on to the expedition, then being at sea with a handful of men for three months. Instead he spiced up the day to day desciptions with detail about sea life and what the crew did to entertain themselves.

Even if you don't study history, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Immediately after WWII, young Thor Heyerdahl tried to submit a paper to academia outlining his idea that the Polynesian islands were not settled from India and Asia, as was the current wisdom, but rather by people from South America. The problem with this idea, pointed out by a number of people, was that the only boats available to the natives of that area were balsa-wood rafts. It was almost impossible to imagine that such a raft could possibly travel 3,600 miles across open ocean to arrive at the Polynesian Islands intact and with living crew. Some people laughed outright at the idea. Many of them thought the idea was crazy.So, in true mad-scientist form, Heyerdahl said to himself &quot;I'll show them. I'll show them ALL!&quot;. Rather than building a mad-scientist deathray, which would not only be cliche but also out of his field (anthropology), he decided to literally show them. He, himself, would build a balsa-wood raft, adhering precisely to the old designs, and he would personally sail that raft from the coast of South America to one of the Polynesian islands a quarter of the world away.The saga of his quest to first find someone to back him on the journey, someone to crew his raft, a way to BUILD the raft, and finally the incredible adventure of actually taking the _Kon Tiki_ across the greatest ocean on Earth, makes fascinating reading. Such a voyage was something of an effort even for modern machines of its era; had Heyerdahl not done it, no one would have believed it. Instead he set sail and brought the future with him.This did not end Heyerdahl's adventures, but instead began them. Later he developed a theory that the Americas themselves were, at least in part, visited by or settled from ancient Egypt. Since the only boats THEY used to cross oceans were made of reeds, no one would believe it was possible..."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"After noticing numerous similarities between aspects of Polynesian culture and Inca culture, Thor Heyerdahl postulates an ancient connection between the two peoples: he argues that Inca traveled to the South Pacific islands and at least partially colonized them. His theory is immediately dismissed by anthropologists for many reasons. Foremost is the argument that the Inca did not have boats capable of crossing the Pacific. All they had were balsa wood rafts, which the experts argue would never survive the trip. Heyerdahl is so sure he is right, he sets out to prove that it is possible to cross the Pacific in a balsa wood raft by making the voyage himself!He recruits five Scandinavian shipmates and heads down to South America to build a balsa wood raft. After wading through much red tape, his crew finally builds a replica raft and sets sail. Everyone thinks they will likely die on the trip, but they are determined to prove them wrong. And they do. On the way, they have fantastic adventures with sharks, unexplained huge creatures far below the raft, fish jumping on board for breakfast, men overboard, and a final exciting crash landing on a South Pacific island.I can't say enough about how enjoyable this book was, but I also can't help but be sad that in the days of satellite mapping, GPS, and red tape, such adventures now seem out of reach. This book has a bit of everything: science, history, engineering, philosophy, and of course loads of maritime adventure from an era when the world's geography was a little more mysterious."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"It's a great read and an epic journey.

Highly recommended for all readers."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"With fond memories of poring over a colorful \\"youth\\" version of Kon-Tiki when I was a school boy in the 1960s, I recently picked up a copy of Thor Heyerdahl's full-length recounting of his exhilarating 4,300 mile open-sea expedition, to understand the background and motivation behind the voyage in more detail. Kon-Tiki is a fascinating book, documenting the even more fascinating true story of why and how six courageous men set sail on a primitive balsa wood raft from Peru in April 1947, blown along on their hundred-day journey to Polynesia by westward trade winds, the same air currents that might have carried early (possibly even the earliest) settlers to these islands 1,500 years ago.Ostensibly, the purpose of the voyage was an exercise in experimental archaeology and ethnography, to demonstrate that a fair-skinned, reddish-haired people, originating from \\"where the current comes in from the Atlantic . . . instead of in the more temperate [Asian] regions where civilizations . . . have had easier conditions for their development,\\" could have, as some cultural clues suggest, sailed westward from the Americas to become the first human inhabitants of the South Pacific, including Easter Island, Hawaii and Tahiti, beginning around 500 A.D. However, as the author himself points out in the brief Appendix, \\"My migration theory . . . was not necessarily proved by the successful outcome of the Kon-Tiki expedition. What we did prove was that . . . the Pacific islands are located well inside the range of prehistoric craft from Peru.\\"Beyond its (controversial) ethnographical underpinnings, Kon-Tiki contains a wealth of interesting ancillary information about botany (how the sap in the core of freshly logged balsa wood prolongs flotation, while the softness and absorbency of its outer layers protects ropes and prevents fraying), ichthyology (the gigantic and ugly whale shark, deadly snake mackerel Gempylus, pilot fish, flying fish, how to catch sharks with one's bare hands, how to harvest plankton for a meal, etc.), agriculture (the origins of the sweet potato and palm tree), and cultural anthropology (generosity and warm spirit of the native people on the island of Raroia, where the Kon-Tiki landed, later studied by crew member, Bengt Danielsson).But, most of all, Kon-Tiki is an enthralling and inspiring adventure of a driven man (Heyerdahl) with an idea and a mission, who succeeds, against the advice of experts (\\"If we added up all that the different experts, each in turn, had pointed out . . . there was not a length of rope, not a knot, not a measurement, not a piece of wood in the whole raft which would not cause us to founder at sea\\"), in accomplishing what common opinion deems impossible. Apparently, such enthusiasm is contagious (or at least genetic), as the author's grandson (Olav Heyerdahl, Tangaroa expedition, 2006) recently completed a retracing of the Kon-Tiki's 1947 voyage. In the author's enthusiastic words during the raft's harrowing reef crossing at voyage's end, through bubbling \\"witches' cauldron\\" with green walls of sea water towering 25 feet above, \\"Hold on!\\" and \\"Hurrah!\\" Definitely a thrilling story!"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"4550 Kon-Tiki Across the Pacific by Raft, by Thor Heyerdahl translated by F.

It tells of a 101-day tip from Peru to French Polynesia made in 1947 by six Norwegian men on a raft using balsa logs. It is a very interesting story, and one stands in amazement at the daring of these men, making such a fearful journey, with no support, though they did have radio equipment on board. I found the account totally interest-holding. The author was convinced that people from South America in about 500 A.D. settled in Polynesia. His trip at least proved that the trip was possible. I think the book ranks with other great adventure books I have read, such as Touching the Void, by Joe Simpson (read 9 Sep 2003) and Alone, by Richard E.

To prove his theory that a long-extinct race in South America was actually descended from a people that came from, and then later returned to Polynesia, Heydrahl set out on a remarkable journey. He, along with five others, made a raft out of balsa logs, and without using metal of any form, sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. Their adventures and struggles, both on and off the raft, combine to make an incredible tale of knowledge, bravery, and luck."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"This was one of my summer reads and I found it incredibly entertaining. The story of how a bunch of crazy Norwegians, many of whom were WWII vets, floated across the South Pacific on a balsa raft during the middle of the 20th century is one of the best adventure stories I have ever read. The line between scientific investigation and insanity is thin on this one. The men set off to prove a link between Ancient Peruvians and Polynesians by proving that the Peruvians had sailed as far as Polynesia on balsa rafts. The group procures its wood from the dangerous, lawless countryside of Peru, floats it down a river to the sea, and sets forth on an epic adventure on a scrappy looking sail driven raft they slapped together using diagrams based off ancient documents.The accounts of flying fish, battles with sharks, and struggles against the elements are highly entertaining. They drifted across seas drawn by the currents through areas of the ocean free of shipping lanes, an adventure unparalleled for its time. Their raft literally became a home to hundreds of sea creatures. They encountered sea creatures that nobody had ever seen before. Although their voyage seems crazy, it was really done and I was actually relieved when the raft broke up on a reef on a South Pacific Island and the men were able to swim to safety.If you've ever dreamed of doing something crazy in the name of scholarly pursuits, or if you like a good adventure tale, this is a good read. Its also an interesting piece of history and Thor Heyerdahl went on to receive hundreds of awards for his incredible accomplishment."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I read this book and its companion book, \\"The RA Expeditions\\" several years ago and enjoyed them both very much.

It's tiring and tedious, and honestly, it's just boring, at least to the 3000 students at the local high school."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"With each passing year, less and less of the world remains to be discovered. With GPS and satellite imagery, our oceans have been charted and the jungles surveyed. Our world is no longer a mystery. No longer do we have maps fringed by threatening pictures of dragons and sea monsters warning sailors and explorers of the unknown that lies out there. But when I picked up this book I was taken back fifty years in time. Back to a time when men ate meat raw and walked around with clubs hunting big game. OK, perhaps I am getting carried away.Thor Heyerdahl believed the Polynesian islands were inhabited by sea faring travellers from Peru. But his thesis on this topic was ridiculed because no one would believe that the pacific ocean could be crossed by a flimsy raft made of balsa wood and bamboo. So Heyerdahl decides to prove IT IS possible by building a raft using exactly the same materials the ancient Peruvians used and sailing off the coast of Peru hoping to eventually reach Polynesia.Nearly every step off his journey was filled with nay sayers who said he was crazy and \\"experts\\" who variably told him he was going to die, the raft was going to break apart, or the balsa wood would absorb the sea water and sink. He ignored them all. When they told him balsa trees of the size he needed no longer existed along the coast, he took a jeep deep into the jungles through flooded roads and GOT his trees. Which then they floated down to the ocean in a river.Heyerdahl is keenly aware of his surroundings and describes his voyage vividly and in simple prose. I could smell the sea breeze and feel the spray of the ocean. It was like taking a mini vacation every time I sat down with this book. You'll swim with whale sharks and get caught in ferocious storms. The six men caught sharks with their hands and even had a pet parrot. I suppose all self respecting seamen need to have a parrot.The ending to this book was surprising but perfect. It brings the story full circle and could not have ended any other way. So prepare yourself a margarita, kick back, and begin a sea adventure."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Kon-Tiki starts with an idea, conceived during Heyerdahl's stay on a South Seas island researching his doctoral thesis: could Polynesia have been colonized by trans-Pacific emigres from the pre-Colombian cultures of South America?A true scientist, Heyerdahl isn't satisfied with deciding &quot;yes&quot; - he must test the theory! In the hands of a lesser man this would have produced a musty old thesis collecting dust on the back shelf of an anthropology library. Instead, Heyerdahl marshals five friends of heroic spirit, acquires 9 giant balsa wood logs and some other supplies, and within a few months he sets sail from Peru to cross the Pacific. Drinking fresh water stored in hollowed-out bamboo shafts and eating fish that leap aboard the raft, they make their way across the ocean, well knowing that despite the advanced radio technology of 1936, their chance of rescue in the event of mishap is nil.The only sea book I can think of to rival this for sheer interest and adventure is Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea,&quot; - a fantasy. Heyerdahl's work is true, and his heroic heart shines through in every word. His love and reverence for the ocean and the primitive culture he sought to imitate, combined with his scientific clarity of exposition, make it a joy to read and will instill the sea-lust into even the most devoted landlubber.I think everyone ought to read this book, for sheer pleasure, and as an example of what can be done with stout heart, clear head, and good will. I recommend it to you without any reservation."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"\\"Kon Tiki\\" is one of the great adventure stories of all time. In 1947, six young Norwegians floated in a balsa-wood raft from Peru to the Polynesian islands of the South Seas. The trip took them 101 days and they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific without seeing a single other boat or ship. Only occasionally were they able to communicate with the outside world by radio, and the possibility of rescue should their primitive raft sink or break up in the heavy seas they often experienced was slim to none.The journey was inspired by the theories of Thor Heyerdahl who speculated that the ancient civilizations of Peru had floated across the Pacific to reach the Polynesian islands. Scoffed at by scientists, Heyerdahl organized the expedition to prove that a raft crossing of the Pacific was possible. It was a foolhardy stunt -- but makes for a great story.\\"Kon Tiki\\" tells the story of the expedition from beginning to the end when the crew of the raft is marooned on an idyllic paradise isle in the South Pacific. Rereading the book after many years, I was most impressed with how isolated and empty the Pacific Ocean was and how unexploited was its sea life in 1947. I fear that such is no longer the case.Heyerdahl's theories of oceanic migrations from the Americas to Polynesia are still pooh-baahed by archaeologists today, although it seems that the sweet potato by some means made it from Peru to Polynesia in pre-historic times. Whatever your opinion may be regarding Heyerdahl as a scientist the story of the \\"Kon Tiki\\" is unique and original. Read it and weep because the opportunity for an adventure of such scope and daring is no longer possible in our over-crowded world.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I have just finished reading this book straight through.

Even then my psyche was thoroghly unwilling to release the warm embrace of Kon Tiki's quest into the primitive and yet tranquil oneness with our world's awesome power and beauty. &quot;Whether it was 1947 B.C. or A.D. suddenly became of no significance. We lived, and that we felt with alert intensity. We realized that life had been full for men before the technical age also--in fact, fuller and richer in many ways than the life of modern man.

Then Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl is the book for you. Kon-Tiki is about a few explorers that wanted to prove that the inhabitants of a certain island in the Pacific came from Peru. The explorers start off at Peru, build a raft, and set off to prove their theory on their 2000-mile journey. On their trip they discover interesting things about sea life. They encountered whales, dolphins, sharks and other amazing creatures of the sea on their journey and learned a few things about them. One of my favorite parts about this book is when the explorers catch their food and interact with some of the sea creatures. They use the resources around them to catch their food and discover that living at sea is not as boring as it seems. This is one of the best books of its time. It has every thing to make you enjoy the story. Kon-Tiki will make you laugh and make you nervous.

What Heyerdahl and his five Norwegian friends were proposing was beyond audacious -- it was foolhardy, by any standard. Here were six young men, none with sailing experience, who were building their own Inca-style raft out of balsa logs and hemp ropes and planning to sail it across thousands of miles of ocean from Peru to the South Seas.Surely, they would die.Of course, they didn't. For over 100 days, the Kon-Tiki bobbed along like a cork in high and low seas making slow but steady progress before eventually landing the men on an island in French Polynesia. In doing so, Heyerdahl, an anthropologist, had made his case that it was possible that the South Sea islands had been populated by immigrants floating on rafts from South America.It was a remarkable accomplishment, and while it is a tale imperfectly told, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is quite worth reading.This is a book where the events carry the writing. For the most part, Heyerdahl does an able job of presenting the story, but he curiously skips over some parts. For instance, he doesn't explain clearly why he allowed the voyage to begin by having the Kon-Tiki towed out of port and many miles out to sea. After all, wasn't the point of the expedition to show that the raft could make it all the way on its own? (There may have been a good reason -- perhaps to avoid shipping traffic -- but he doesn't say what it is.)Because the trip actually turned out to be easier than expected, the middle section becomes somewhat flat. The crew had plenty of fish to eat, and collected rain water to drink. They found ways to make the craft easy to steer.Also, while Heyerdahl is detailed in his descriptions of the fish they saw while crossing the ocean, he fails to illuminate the personalities of his five crewmates. Even by the end of the book, they remained indistiguishable in my mind.These are weaknesses, yes, but hardly fatal ones, and the overall boldness of this adventure is what carries this book. There are exciting moments -- when one of the men falls overboard and is nearly lost, and when the Kon-Tiki dramatically crashes into a reef at the end of its voyage. And the crew's short stay on an island inhabited by just 127 villagers is memorable for its idyllic picture of the South Seas lifestyle."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Although the middle part of this book drags (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), I was really satisfied when I finished reading this book. I was on vacation in Oslo and had visited the Kon-Tiki museum. I had never heard of Thor Heyerdahl before, but from what I saw at the museum, I was very fascinated and intrigued by the story of his trip across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft. The week I came home I immediately started reading this book, and I was not disappointed. I was really fascinated by the accounts of interaction with sea animals, whales, sharks, dolphins, etc. that I immediately wanted to go sailing on a wide open sea in order to see all these exotic animals that Heyerdahl and his crew encountered. This book allows you to live vicariously and experience three months worth of sailing on a raft in the Pacific Ocean. This is a definite read for the sea lovers and travelers out there in the world who yearn for adventure."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"The voyage of the Kon-Tiki ranks as one of the great adventures of ourera. But was Heyerdahl's journey that of a &quot;luckyadventurer&quot; whose theories could be justly dismissed as&quot;junk science&quot; by the archaeological establishment? Or didhis knowledge that the seas were virtual conveyor belts unveil thepossibility that ancient peoples were not limited to migration overland bridges but could more easily have voyaged in rafts over openseas? Tom Dillehay's dating of the Monte Verde site in Chile to 12,500years ago -- hundreds of years before the Mackenzie corridor openedthe remote possibility of Beringia (dry Bering Sea) migration -- seemsto have driven a stake into the theory that man first migrated by landto the Americas. Now paleontologist Walter Neves has revealed that a11,500-year-old skull from central Brazil (&quot;Luzia&quot;) has theround eyes, large nose and pronounced chin characteristic ofAustralian aborigines and native Africans. Will Heyerdahl's theoriesfinally receive the attention in academic circles they have longdeserved?"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"As a youngster, I watched the documentary of this amazing story and was immediately hooked on it. A few years later, I read the book and was enthralled. Dr. Heyerdahl's ultimate 'field study' to prove that ancient peoples could cross vast stretches of ocean held my attention from beginning to end; I read the entire book in just a couple of days. Heyerdahl's other works such as &quot;Fatu-Hiva,&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku&quot; are also rousing stories of his real-life exploits. However, it is &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; which retains the best spirit of adventure and human endeavor, and thus remains my personal favorite.As the above title states, there is a sad note to include in this review: I learned yesterday (4/18/02) that Dr. Heyerdahl died of a brain tumor at age 87. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"This is an immensely inspiring account of human adventure and perseverance. It sets man against sea, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against the independent thinker. This four thousand mile journey across barren, treacherous seas can't help but inspire the would-be adventurer. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination, in the face of naysaying world experts (who said they would never succeed, and that their boat would sink at mid-sea), shows how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what some may view as impossible goals, and in so doing it pushes the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. We see that not all adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across a massive barren and stormy ocean, real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its call for adventure and begin plans for achieving personal goals or adventures ... all the tools needed for accomplishment are demonstrated in this voyage. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. Can this book reawaken a spirit of adventure which may seem irrelevant to modern social or commercial life? Can it remind us how to dream and the virtues of following our dreams? I am reminded in these pages how, why, and where I can find adventure ... one walks away from the book convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I finished this book a few months after Heyerdahl's grandson completed his own Kon-Tiki adventure taking the path of his grandfather from Peru to the South Sea Islands on a balsa wood raft. Will a book be the result of this most recent Heyerdahl excursion? Time will tell.It will be hard, however, for the younger Heyerdahl to top his elder's classic saga. This is a wonderfully clear read for all ages and a self-portrait of a good, decent, brave man who did something because he knew it could be done.The highlights for me are the descriptions of the marine life Heyerdahl and his five compatriots encounter on their trip, including the massive blue shark whale, the dolphins, and the playful flying fish. The \\"homecoming,\\" in which the six Scandinavians are welcomed by the Polynesian people in an elaborate ceremony, is also delightful and a wonderful way to conclude the adventure.KON-TIKI deserves its classic status and should be read by anyone looking to see how resillient the human spirit (and body, for that matter) really is."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Kon-Tiki is the story of some Scandinavians who sail across the Pacific in an Incan raft made of balsa, in order to lend credence to a cultural-diffussionist theory hypothesized by the author and leader of the \\"adventure,\\" Thor Heyerdahl. (The theory is that Polynesia was colonized from the east, South America. The voyage across the Pacific was to prove that it was possible for ancient Peruvians to cross the ocean. However, the voyage does not prove Heyerdahl's theory.) The book goes into great detail describing the encounters of the crew onboard out on the open ocean including an encounter with a whale shark, a rare Gempylus, circling dolphins, flying fish so abundant that they fly onto the raft's deck whereupon they can be gathered for food, whales, and sharks. The men lived off the sea by fishing and trapping rain water, braving the elements in a 40-foot long raft for 101 days before finally shipwrecking upon a reef surrounding a small island.The book is well written and an enjoyable, absorbing read."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"If you feel really crummy, you are getting really desperate and you absolutely have to cheer up, this is the book for you! The author writes with a sublime un-self-conciousness (is that a word?) conveying the power, beauty, and adventure of the ocean and his amazing quest to prove an idea. The power and human spirit of this man is awesome. It feels something like Hucklebery Finn but this is reality."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"Although the theory this adventure was trying to prove (that the South Pacific Islands were populated by people from South America) has been disproved, it still DID prove that ancient natives were indeed capable of great sea voyages using simple boats. (Many experts said this was impossible.) I loved this book and was pulled in from the very first page. I love true stories of people who throw caution to the wind and have astonishing and unique adventures. Imagine sailing over 4,000 nautical miles on a raft. I learned a great deal about sea life as I read the book. I found myself going to the web to find more facts about the fish and other marine life. Also incorporated into the book is legend and lore about Polynesian culture and history. Including Easter Island. I spent 2 weeks on Easter Island, and have a special fascination with it. I enjoyed this book immensely!"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"The idea seems crazy because it is: Prove the possible validity of a scorned ethnographic theory by sailing over 4,000 miles across the world's largest ocean, laying your life and those of five companions on nine balsa-wood logs held together by rope. History would be made, if not of the kind author and expedition leader Thor Heyerdahl imagined.\\"Ours was a journey with an objective, and we did not want to be classed with acrobats who roll down Niagara in empty barrels or sit on the knobs of flag staffs for 17 days,\\" he writes.Oh well. Heyerdahl wanted to prove it possible for ancient Peruvians to colonize various Pacific islands, and managed instead to prove man's ability to realize the impossible fortified with little more than bravery. As feats go, it's a little like missing the Moon and landing on Mars. No one would remember the Kon-Tiki 65 years after its voyage, or spoken about it in classrooms around the world for two generations, if it had achieved a mere scientific objective.As a literary endeavor, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" the book leaves me somewhat flat. Published in 1948, one year after the expedition itself, it's an adventure story in which adventure is nearly entirely absent apart from the fact Heyerdahl and his companions are on this creaking raft in the first place. Other than early steering troubles on the Pacific's unforgiving Humboldt Current, a rough encounter with a whale shark, a close shave with another shark, and a wave-ripped landing, all described in a curious, detached way, what we get is a fairly placid ride. There are arresting observations of oceanic life, especially as the Kon-Tiki becomes a kind of lifeform itself, with crabs and barnacles finding safe harbor in its wood, plants growing around its edges, and pilot fish swimming in formation beneath. But there are many lulls in the story, too.What was it like for six men traveling in such close quarters and such uncertain circumstances? \\"No two of these men had men before, and they were all of entirely different types,\\" Heyerdahl states early on, warning of \\"the danger of psychological cloudburst\\" there. But nothing more is ever stated about the interpersonal relations aboard the Kon-Tiki; we don't even get to know any of these Norwegians (and one Swede) well enough to tell them apart beyond their names.The book does make a strong case for the fortitude of man, whether ancient or modern, provides some fine nature writing, and occasional gleamings of welcome humor. Heyerdahl makes a strong case for his belief in Mesoamerican settlement of the Pacific islands, even if his voyage doesn't prove anything. [The Kon-Tiki not only required towing out to sea but made an inauspicious landfall if one is to believe in the viability of his theory.] More than anything, it's time well spent with an interesting group of men doing a rather incredible thing, even if they were more impressed with the theory behind it than the feat itself."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl.

Heyerdahl's exploits indeed do come across as completely fantastic, as if from an imaginged story. This is mainly because important misadventures were not included in his text, and only after interviewing island natives and a careful look at his discoveries and methods were such things discovered. I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to read about the great adventures of a single man and his crew aboard a raft, I do not reccomend this work to be taken completely literally and as a scholarly report. If such a book appeals to you, by all means, read it and enjoy it, but I highly suggest doing your homework before accepting his journey as full truth."},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft","review":"I made some Mormons angry over my reviews of books that defend the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews. Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. ThanksOn Kon-Tiki: I absolutely got lost in this magnificent adventure. Nevertheless, Heyerdahl's theory that civilization was spread around the world by some lost white race is simply bogus racism. Still, I enjoyed all his books, including \\"The Ra Expeditions,\\" and \\"Aku-Aku.\\"It is sad to think that Heyerdahl's career as a fearless adventurer is marred by his zealous devotion to a dated idea. Yes, Peruvian Indians could have crossed the Pacific, but it is more likely that contact came from the other way. At any rate, Heyerdahl manufactured the archaeological evidence he found on Easter Island.In the July 2002 issue of the \\"Smithsonian Magazine,\\" Richard Conniff demonstrated that Heyerdahl actually paid the natives to make reed-boats relics (Kon Artist?\\" was the title). \\"A good story,\\" said Conniff, \\"can be so compelling that teller and subject become entrapped together in its charms....\\" (p. 28). This astute observation could apply to novels claimed to be actual history, and anyone interested in the Book of Mormon should give it long thought.Heyerdahl wrote about Pedro Pate, an Easter Islander and how Pate found a two-masted reed boat in a cave. Conniff wrote: \\"I showed Pate a two-page photograph of the reed boat from Heyerdahl's book, and he grinned. He'd carved the boat himself, he said. Dubious, I offered him $100 to carve such a boat now, 37 years later, and he accepted.\\" \\"A few days later, he presented me with the 18-inch-long reed boat he had carved. It was as good as the one in the book\\" (p. 29).In \\"The Ancient American Civilizations,\\" Friedrich Katz asked some very hard questions of Heyerdahl's theory.\\"If the Polynesians really do come from America, why do their chronicles record the exact opposite direction, naming South-East Asia as their place of origin? Why is their language first and foremost related to South-Asiatic and Malayan languages? Finally, as Trimborn remarked, 'Were not the Polynesian Vikings, rather than the Indians, not the sailors who crossed the high seas?'\\" (p. 18).Heyerdahl should also be criticized for playing word games, selecting a word here and there, but ignoring the whole language. Many linguists criticized this erroneous method of relating two ancient peoples. See Robert Wauchope's magnificent little book, \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\" See my review.Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theMormon writers frequently cite Heyerdahl because he proved that ancient voyages across the oceans were possible--an idea going back hundreds of years and not new with Heyerdahl. Very few scholars ever denied that such ancient voyages were possible.But ah, there's the rub, as Hamlet said. If they occurred, what would be the effect on an entrenched native culture? The Book of Mormon has ancient voyages (the Jaredites were supposed have crossed the ocean on a 344-day voyage in eight submarines in about 2,000 BC). It is primarily about the great civilizations the Jaredites and Nephites established in the Americas.Robert Sharer summarizes the modern state of knowledge in his heavy and authoritative book, \\"The Ancient Maya.\\" Sharer writes:\\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\"\\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\" See Sharer's book and my review.The Ancient Maya, 6th EditionNone of these serious criticisms of the claims of Mormons or of Heyerdahl's theories, however, should detract from Heyerdahl's great adventures. His accounts of his raft voyages are breathless and compelling reading.For a masterful telling of Polynesian history (especially about Easter Island) by a scholar with a Moari heritage, read the essential book \\"Vikings of the Pacific,\\" by Peter H.

Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a &quot;major event&quot; was the daily circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten times. This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or written well. It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings.

Catherine Allgor's new book, &lt;em>A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation&lt;/em>, kicks off with this very moment in history, then wheels back to our most famous historical First Lady's birth and childhood, spending considerable time on her marriage to James Madison, our third President, and wrapping up with Dolley's legacy. While Dolley's life is fascinating, from her Quaker upbringing, to her role as the social center of Washington, D.C. during her husband's presidency, it is Allgor's voice that truly brings this first serious biography on Dolley for years to enthralling and entertaining life. There is a knowing wink, a mischievous suggestion, and a comprehensive knowledge of the emerging power of women, particularly political power, infusing Allgor's prose. Allgor paints a thorough and believable portrait of a woman who broke very important ground for all the women in politics who came after her. She also does a terrific job melding the thorough research of an academic text with an engaging style that will appeal to all readers."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"The primary research behind this biography is staggering and utterly wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I also have to say that my view of the War of 1812 has been significantly altered, from viewing it as a grievous international mistake to a domestic economic crisis which eerily forecast the American Civil War. Dolley herself as a subject is enchanting. And very funny. And charming. And moving. There are some colorful implications made by primary sources: President Jefferson was a bit of a whack job; America sided with France because the French ambassador's wife was Dolley's best friend and the wife of the British envoy was so awful the couple was socially blackballed; and Madison's strongest reason for declaring war might have been to get re-elected. While I think Allgor may go a bit overboard in all she credits Dolley with, I certainly applaud her break with traditional patriarchal history to reveal the considerable power of at least this one woman in creating a sense of American nationalism. This is very well written, by the way, and quotes from the original sources are seamlessly interwoven."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"I picked up a copy of A PERFECT UNION: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation, by Catherine Allgor as research material for a novel set during the War of 1812. I had already read The Velvet Glove: A Life of Dolley Madison, by Noel Bertram Gerson, but I wanted more detail and insight regarding President and Mrs. Madison. I wasn't disappointed.A Perfect Union is packed full of information for a novelist wanting to add verisimilitude to a story. For anyone with more than a casual interest in the War of 1812, it provides fascinating insight into behind-the-scenes Washington City and a struggling new nation. Unlike most accounts, it illuminates the war and the political scene from a feminine viewpoint.For the most part, the facts presented by Ms. Allgor were consistent with my other sources. I noticed only a few factual glitches. I believe British atrocities were committed on the raid of Hampton village, not the battle of Craney Island a few days earlier. And I understand that the Capitol was still in two parts, separated by a wooden walkway, when the redcoats torched it.Overall, A Perfect Union is a fascinating look into the life and times of Dolley Madison."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"Catherine Allgor serves up a great examination of not only Dolley Madison but a revealing picture of early politics in early America in A Perfect Union. I think she does a wonderful job in exposing how the Madison's, primarily Dolley, countered Jefferson in the way they operated in the young capitol. Allgor also gives us an entertaining glimpse into how an eighteeth century wife supported her husband, perhaps even out-shining him a bit. Allgor also shows us the private Dolley; the Dolley who managed a home but also liked to play cards and was pretty good at it. She also liked to drink....just a bit. These and other facts are great counterpoints to the public Dolley we've all learned about.I'm always a sucker for any book that deals with this period of American history. Early conditions in this country, especially during those years immediately following the revolution, allowed for a great deal of movement, especially socially and politically. Dolley truly shined during this era and Allgor does a wonderful job in painting that picture.As you read this book it becomes quite obvious that Allgor loves to do research. Her facts aren't in question though some other reviewers believes she goes too far. Perhaps. However, the greater value in A Perfect Union is the fact that the whole story is hereA worthwhile read for sure."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"A PERFECT UNION: DOLLEY MADISON AND THE CREATION OF THE AMERICAN NATION is a 'must' for any serious history holding surveying the making of early America.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"I applaude Catherine Allgor's efforts for creating a fascinating life-and-times of book. It is a cultural history filled with detais for example, about Washington City which, in 1801, included 8 boarding houses, 109 brick houses and 263 wooden houses. Its population consisted of only 2,064 whites, 623 slaves and 123 free blacks. There were 106 representatives in congress and 32 senators, and it seemed most of them adored Dolley Madison, who travelled the streets of Washington City in a dark green chariot with silver monograms on its doors, venetian blinds and candles. It cost James Madison $594 second-hand.I found this tid-bit amusing: James Madison's proposal of marriage to a congressman's daughter was rejected by a letter sealed with rye dough to show that the young woman's feelings had soured. The young woman was only 15 and Madison was 42. But, in fact, he was 17 years older than Dolley.Did you know that the White House became known as the White House during the Madison years? Did you know that until 1807 women in New Jersey had the right to vote?One of the most interesting factors is the similarity between the Madison and Obama problems with congress. According to Allgor: \\"Congress was riddled with hostile factions, mainly Federalists and renegade Republicans {the Invisibles} who hated James so much that they were willing to sacrifice the general welfare in their zeal to destroy him. So concerned with their personl agenda were these disloyal members of congress, they not only failed to perform the day-to-day business of governing, but their openly quarrelsome behavior embarrassed the government in the eyes of the world and its own citizenry. The result was an erosion of the peoples'confidence in their government as well as their president since he seemed powerless to rein in his congress.\\"As often as possible, I purchase my books on audio discs.

But she was so much more than that - really she was much of the power behind her husband's presidency.This book did do a great job of giving the reader a solid understanding of just how much of a political role Dolley had and how important she was not only to her husband's presidency, but that of Jefferson as well. You get a well rounded idea of who she was and why she was so well known to those of her time.I was also thrilled by the quantity of primary source documents and references that were peppered throughout the book. We are privy to many of her letters to her friends and sisters which provide not only a glimpse at the political but also the private life of this lady. You are able to feel very connected to her thoughts and feelings through these words.But, there were also some aspects of this book that I thought could have been much better. First of all, there is a lot of repetition of phrases - and it's not done to drive home a particular message - it is more like there needed a better job in the editing process. When these things are noticeable there is a something wrong. I kept thinking, \\"you already told me that!\\". I also thought that there was a little bit too much time spent on the personal life of Thomas Jefferson. To some extent this is necessary as Dolley did a lot for Jefferson as well, but there came a point when I started thinking I was reading a Jefferson biography instead and lost sight of the subject of the book. I would also have liked a little bit more about James Madison - he just appears and then they are wed. He is someone who's backstory would have fit well into the book and helped support more of Dolley's story as well.Overall this was a decent read, but I have read better about Dolley."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"\\"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation by Catherine Allgor is an interesting book and I have to agree with a previous reviewer that it is a tough read.I found the content dealing with Dolley's early life (Childhood to First Marriage) as well as her elder years (Post-Presidency) to be very captivating and focused specifically on Dolley. Where the book lost direction was during her Washington years, as the author spent just as much (if not more) of the book painting the scene of the time, such as talking in-depth about Thomas Jefferson's presidency and Washington politics at the time, than it did about focusing on Dolley.This might have been necessary to put Dolley into context and her role in Washington as not only First Lady but as her playing hostess to the entire nation, but I found it a little detracting from what I was interested in reading about. I'm not a historian but it almost seems as if documents from the time recorded little first hand information about Dolley as women weren't really a topic of historical interest.Overall I think the book is a fascinating look into Post-Revolutionary American from the perspective of (arguably) the most well known Woman in the land and how her position in society played into politics."},{"Title":"A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation","review":"I had read that Dolley Madison is probably one of the most interesting, lesser known first ladies in our nation's history. This book definitly prooves that. Although there are a few inaccurate facts surrounding the Yellow Fever experience by Dolley's family in Philadelphia, Allegor seems like a trustworthy source on the topic. Hopefully she will release later editions in order to correct those inaccurate facts. It is also a shame there is not more information about her life before James Madison, with her first husband. But then again, that is not the main theme of this book.

This book is competent but unsatisfying.Unfortunately, the author has an axe to grind. She says that Dolley helped create the American political process by letting Federalists converse civilly with Democratic-Republicans at her parties. First, this is not a particularly novel or stunning idea. Second, Dolley isn't controversial; we don't need a biography with a thesis. I crave more information about non-political relationships: with her mother-in-law, for example; with Aaron Burr (doesn't legend say he courted her in her widowhood?). We need a family tree, at least for the Paynes, and more attention to detail. Which niece is \\"Annie Payne Cutts\\"? Dolley's age is lost sight of a couple of times, and her brother William Temple is mentioned only at his death. Wasn't Dolley related to Patrick Henry and more distantly to Angelica Van Buren, Mary Todd, and possibly Julia Tyler? Those connections I am disappointed to see ignored.The illustrations are the main reason for keeping the book, but the photo captions could be better.

It was all right, but far too detailed for a biography on someone who was not a substantial contributor to American History. There were endless descriptions of the type of furniture used in the rooms, etc. which got a bit tedious. It was as though someone wrote a 1000 page biography of Jacqueline Kennedy and her role in JFK's administration; this would suffer from the same problems.

This coffee-table book is about 1 inch thick, and about 14 by 18 inches wide and deep.I ordered this book from Amazon, but Amazon only lists one author. Amazon's author byline should say Roy King & Burke Davis (as it does on the image). The lithographs come from the Roy King collection. Burke Davis is a historian. This book was published in 1987, a reprint of a 1968 edition. My book's cover art matches the image Amazon provides, except my cover has a white background, not a black background. I got lucky. I prefer the white background. My cover art depicts the same ice skating scene you see on the Amazon image, only with a white border around it.There are 60 lithographs and they seem to be arranged by time period. Each lithograph is 11 x 14 inches, allowing for wide margins. Each lithograph has a caption beneath it, providing the title of the piece and the date (the date is in tiny print).When the book is open, the reader sees a page of text on the left-hand page. The text aligns with the lithograph displayed on the facing right-hand page. The text is interesting, discussing the historical events, places, or people depicted in the lithograph. The text added a great deal to my enjoyment and understanding of each lithograph.I love browsing through this book, imagining a time \\"when life was slow and oh so mellow\\" (and reflecting on how far we've come)"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Basketball","review":"Classy Clyde Frazier covers the fundamentals of basketball: the vocabulary, the role of each position, the basics of offense and defense, and a few common set plays. His writing is fun to read if a bit dumbed-down (hence the title). He draws examples largely from his playing days, but knows well and comments aptly on players of all eras. He draws the distinctions between college and pro ball and includes women's and high school ball, but properly focuses primarily on the NBA, where the game is played at its highest level. He shows you what to focus on when you watch a game and demonstrates how each player's skills come into play in the course of offense and defense. This book will enhance the novice's appreciation for and enjoyment of the game; from what I have read of Digger Phelps' &quot;Basketball for Dummies,&quot; I'm glad I read Clyde's book instead."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Basketball","review":"Buy Basketball for Dummies instead.In search of a book which would get me up to speed about a sport which I had never played but which my sons have become increasingly passionate about, I bought and read both.

The references to today's players are painfully few. His snipping asides against the work ethic of today's players should have no space in a book of this sort; it serves only to make him sound whinny. His writing is practically devoid of humour and his descriptions of plays and strategies are fairly tedious. The game just does not come alive under his pen. Had I been an absolute newcommer to the sport when I read this book, I would have encouraged my boys to take up more exciting sports like synchronised swimming.

The Charioteer is not infused with the history of a period, no descriptions of politics or great battles or historical details. Writing in this modern wartime setting is, I think, so close to Renault's own world that it evaporates from her prose. The characters and events, what events there are, occur almost in a dreamy vacuum. Renault writes inside her characters' minds, not looking out from their eyes into the world, but inward-turning. It's also a sort of cryptic, poetic style of writing, which I personally did not enjoy so much. If you are a fan of poetry and philosophical meandering, you may enjoy this, but readers looking for a visceral book in terms of place and time setting, characters, action, etc should look elsewhere. The book is filled with emotion, but it's emotion tempered by self-contemplation and self-doubt. The main characters are pressed down tight, a stranglehold on their actions and feelings.It's brilliantly written, but I didn't enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I am a gay man. Based on the very positive comments I read about this book I was much looking forward to reading it. Well, I am quite disappointed. It's elaborately written to the point of boring me stiff. Every notion, every thought, every movement of an eyebrow or the batting of an eyelid is described, acknowledged, explained, reasoned in extensive detail, thus often bringing the \\"action\\" to a screeching halt. I had a tough time reading it. The language is beautiful and rich. No denying. The dialogues vary from a realistic down to earth to highly stilted. Did gay men at WWII time really converse like \\"this\\"? For good orders' sake: I read the Pantheon paperback version of '83. \\"The Charioteer\\" was first published in '59. I dare say that by today's conceptions and expectations it is dated; of a certain historical value, maybe. Much is said between the lines. Patricia Nell Warren's \\"Front runner\\" and \\"Harlan's race\\" are, in comparison, almost pornographic. Our befuddled hero, Laurie (!!), eventually on page 267 has the sudden audacity to \\"lean over and kiss him\\" (= Andrew, the young man he admires). Kiss him where? On the forehead, the cheek, or (Heaven forbid) on the mouth? We are left guessing. Should we still care at that point. At around page 317 we learn in a most discrete manner that Laurie and his other love interest, Ralph, finally wound up between the sheets. A love story? I really don't know. It takes the protagonists the longest to even speak of love. My patience with the characters pretty soon came to an end. Despite my good intentions I could hardly muster an interest in them in the long run. And finishing reading \\"The Charioteer\\" ultimately became a duty, an obligation, not a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"After \\"the Persian Boy\\" this was recommmended to me, a love tiangle story played during the beginning of WWII in France among British boys. It was OK, rather wordy and not very dramatic."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"Reading this book as a heterosexual female, I can't say that I identified with any of the characters; but Mary Renault has written a remarkable book that explores the issue of love from various sides and gives us an in-depth view of a people coming to terms with their own sexuality and what it will mean for them in the world at large.The time is 1940 and the place is England just after the retreat from Dunkirk; in the memorable words of Winston Churchill, it was their finest hour. At the center of the book is Laurie Odell, wounded in action, waking up in a military hospital to the fact that he will be crippled for life. The problem for Laurie is that he fears being emotionally crippled as well. Laurie is a graduate of a rigid British prep school where the head boy, Ralph Lanyon, was the object of his hero worship; Ralph is kicked out in a sensational scandal involving a hysterical accusation of homosexual activity with another boy in the school. Laurie is sexually attracted to Ralph and when Ralph is expelled, he realizes that the attraction was mutual, but that Ralph never approached him because he knew better than Laurie himself did that Laurie hadn't awakened to his own sexual orientation yet, and Ralph was not about to take that responsibility for him. While recuperating in the hospital, Laurie meets Andrew, a young conscientious objector who looks up to him as Laurie had looked up to Ralph. Andrew, however, is a total innocent, and his uncompromising religious views would make him look upon homosexual love as an abomination, even while he is attracted to Laurie. While on leave from the hospital, Laurie runs into Ralph, whom he hadn't seen since he was expelled from prep school seven years earlier, and learns that it was Ralph who piloted the navy boat that rescued him from Dunkirk. Ralph has been wounded as well, however, having had half his hand shot off, so the two of them are basically free and unfettered to start a relationship.Ralph has grown hard and cynical after seven years of searching for love with increasingly superficial partners, and he has hit rock bottom with his current partner, whose sole attraction is his dazzling good looks. The attraction between Ralph and Laurie is immediate and compelling, and throws Laurie into a dilemma: he can hook up with Ralph and face up to the fact of his homosexuality which he has been hiding from everyone, including himself; or he can remain on a platonic basis with Andrew and remain sexually frustrated. At the core of his problem is trying to resolve how one can be gay and maintain his integrity at the same time. After meeting some of Ralph's associates, he isn't so sure. Laurie doesn't want to be dragged into the gay milieu, and Ralph sees Laurie as his means of escape from that milieu, and the bottom line for them both is, are they homosexual men, or are they men who happen to be homosexual.Things get complicated when Laurie tells Ralph about Andrew (one of the things that attracts Ralph to Laurie is his fundamental honesty) and although he understands Laurie's dilemma, Ralph isn't about to let him off the hook; he tells Laurie that he has a choice: he can continue to help Andrew tell lies to himself about himself, or he can help Andrew face up to what he is. Laurie doesn't want that responsibility with Andrew any more than Ralph wanted it with him seven years earlier, and he temporizes until someone intervenes and Andrew has to face his own nature up close and personal. The resulting explosion shakes everyone up; Laurie finally realizes that being human ultimately means being true to oneself. What that means for Laurie is resolved at the end of the book.There are several interesting secondary characters in the story, including Alec, one of Ralph's previous partners, decent, honest, but unable to commit more than superfically, and Sandy, Alec's current partner, insecure, demanding, jealous, but also capable of love, and Bunny, Ralph's latest, despicable, devious, and totally amoral. But the three main characters are the most compelling: Andrew, whose rigid, unbending morality finally makes him snap; Ralph, hard, jaded, yet with a core of innocence and trust that still makes him believe that love is not a myth; and Laurie himself, trying to resolve who he is and what he stands for as a man and as a human being. For all its being a World War II story, the problems and issues are timeless and make the book as fresh today as it was 60 years ago when it was first issued. Mary Renault has shown with \\"The Charioteer\\" that she is not only a great historical novelist, she is one of the best writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The complicated romances of closeted gay men in England at the height of World War II seems an unlikely subject, but Renault endows The Charioteer with such depth of perception that virtually any reader will be fascinated by her story of three young men who strive to reconcile the frequently opposing forces of sex, love, and personal integrity in their lives and relationships. Considerably more than just a &quot;gay love story,&quot; Renault's novel examines what it means to be completely honest and completely fair in even the most difficult of relationships at even the most difficult moments of life.Written with both on-the-surface (as in the myth of the Charioteer) and covert (it is no accident that many of the characters are in some way physically damaged, or that the story is set during England's darkest hours of the war) symbolism, Renault's novel encourages the reader to take time over it. Although sometimes demanding, the book casts a spell; I can honestly say that I did not want it to end, but I wanted to know more about what the future held for the characters. It is a book to which readers will return again and again."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I have been a firm Mary Renault fan ever since I read her first historical romance -- The Persian BoyUntil Icame across the Charioteer, I had always thought that shespecialised in writing hsitorical works, I had no idea thatshe started out writing novels set in contemporary timesI live in a Muslim country where homosexuality is nottoleratedAlthough I'm not a Muslim and am a hextrosexual, I too was very biased against homosexualityI never saw gays as being normal -- they were an abominationI thoughtTwo books were instrumental in me changing theway I looked at homosexuality. One was the Persian Boyalso by Ms Renault and the other, The CharioteerThis book made me realise that in the end, all people are the sameregardless of their sexual orientation. Ms Renault portrayedthe characters beautifully and showed very positive imagesof gay men and the conflict that they go through.Although in most western countries the climate is very freefor gay men to come out, here in the east, especially aconservative country like mine, the situation is still likewhat it is described in the bookFor me personally, I have never been able to get the twomain characters, Ralph and Laurie out of my head. My onlyregret is that Ms Renault never furnished a sequel forthe novel because it ends rather abruptly. Although it is implied inthe novel that Laurie will forgive Ralph, I am dying to knowwhat happens to them say, five years down the road.For all those homophobics out there, this is one book whichyou must read. Ms Renault is proof that the msot intenseemotions and love can still be explained without havingto resort to graphic sex scenes which are so prevalentin today's books."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"\\"The Charioteer\\" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read, I hadn't felt such intense emotions reading a book since my adolescence. Before and much more than being a gay story, this is first of all a novel about love, showing in a most powerful way how all life is a struggle to love and to be loved, because only by giving and receving love one can feel alive and life is meaningful and worth being lived.The three main characters, each of them absolutely fascinating and superbly portrayed, discover and are confronted with their own true nature when falling in love, but they also have to make choices and take on responsibilities which often seem unbearable. Love is shown through all its sweetness and romance but also in all its terribly dramatic implications: love always means suffering and none of the characters is spared his share of pain and defeat. But the force of life triumphs despite everyone's conflicts, limitations and mistakes, which must be coped with and accepted in mutual respect and forgiveness.The young protagonists are brought to life in an amazingly effective way and they are so vivid and forceful that they outlive the end of the book itself. The reader can share their most intimate thoughts and the decisive turns of their lives and is therefore bound to feel strong compassion. I am not surprised that a lot of readers wish there had a been a sequel of the novel, but I believe the author did the right thing not writing one. The end of the story leaves very open prospects and, especially considering the circular structure the novel acquires at its conclusion, all the characters are liable to being again together in their maturity and it is better to let the reader imagine possible evolutions.The narrative scheme is very solid and well balanced, all parts of the book contribute to light up the whole plot; the text flows slowly but continuously and once you adapt yourself to the inner rhythm of the story you are fully involved and almost become a part of it, each line adding a relevant detail or setting the suitable atmosphere to lead you deeper into the characters' inner thoughts and feelings; the language is rich though never mannered and the style is often very poetic but never in a cheap way.\\"The Charioteer\\" certainly stands also as a great gay story and is very effective in demonstrating the universality of love, which transcends lovers' genders and social barriers. Its explict homosexual theme is all the more surprising if one thinks the book was written almost fifty years ago, when to state that love between two men has the same dignity as heterosexual love was certainly a hard challenge, and that it was written by a woman, as the protagonists are absolutely and coherently credible and masculine in their appearance and psychology.Needless to say a wonderful film would come out of this book. I do wish a talented director could see to this undertaking. I find Matt Damon (especially after being Mr Ripley) would make a perfect Laurie Odell and he might also be the film director and producer himself.Reading \\"The Charioteer\\" can be a heart-wrenching experience and cause to shed more than one tear, especially if one is in love, but it also makes one feel more attached to the beauty of life and long for youth and pure, noble, authentic love, the most important of all things. This novel and its appealing characters, Laurie, Andrew and Ralph, will always remain in my mind and heart as wonderful companions of my youth, revealers of the complexity and fragility of the human soul and of myself, an important landmark in the search for my identity of adult gay man.P.S.It is a shame that \\"The Charioteer\\" is not translated into Italian. It is certainly the kind of book it can be difficult to read in a second language and I sometimes experienced this difficulty myself. Now it has become my dream to translate it into my first language one day because I want such a beautiful novel to be accessible to all Italian readers."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read this book before ever indulging in Mary Renault's ancient Greek fiction, although this story is every bit as entertaining, even set in World War II.The two main characters, Laurie and Ralph, struggle with their love for one another as well as their devotion and dedication to their relationship, and their friendship as well.This book is every bit as timeless as the ancient Greece novels, yet a bit dated of a read amidst modern day views and sensibilities about homosexual relationships. It does, however, send readers back to a time where more value was placed upon the root of a relationship and of love. It transcends the need for graphic sexual display, yet does not hide the nature of the involvement between the two men.Of all the homosexual themed novels I have read, this is far and away my favorite. Even though it was written over forty years ago, it stands the test of time in its message of understanding the value of love, regardless of gender."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I first read this book because it was mentioned in Bruce Bawer's &quot;A Place at the Table&quot;. I never expected that it would impact me so startlingly! I identified very closely with Laurie Odell, the main character, and his struggles with experiencing love as a gay man. All of the characters in the book are well-developed, even ones we don't meet very often. Renault manages to put together a wonderful, sometimes heart-wrenching story that doesn't restrict itself to people with gay experiences. ANYONE could read this book and feel total empathy with Laurie. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who has the least interest in reading a love story--it won't disappoint. I only wish that the story could have continued, perhaps in a sequel. Still, a very touching and satisfying tale."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The book reviewers have eloquently described the characters and plot of the book. I would add though, while repeating some reviewers, that we follow a young man's journey through self-recognition and with all his dignity intact, chooses the path he deems for himself.It is a model of how to think and act while maintaining pride,in one's eyes and in others. It is painful, as he chooses a life considered perverted by a society in a time that considers homosexuality an illness and all who are homosexuals to be shunned and ridiculed. Laurie chooses his path with his past experiences in life, situations, philosophical and poetical knowledge as guide posts. The ending is bittersweet but triumphant. A bible on how to act, on your own to find the life that will give you happinessMary Renault's writing is magical. With her use of metaphors, similes and quotations from classical literature, the author creates a person realistic, sensitive and sympathetic. The reader is uplifted."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"If it is possible for a novel to enhance a persons life, then 'The Charioteer' did that for me. I first read the book over 20 years ago and its effect was profound. Each time I have re-read it, further insights into the characters and the era have unfolded. I have spoken to gay men of that time who have read the book and they confirm the complexities of homsexual relationships as written by Ms Renault. How different the'scene' is half a century later - and then, how similar. Very different from her historical novels, 'The Charioteer' is a study of humanity that places her firmly in company of the greats!"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I agree that I have always pictured this as a movie. It seemed like a natural subject for Merchant and Ivory, though it is too late for that, now. Someone said it isn't a historical title, but since I didn't live through WWII on the British home front, it was for me. The immediacy of war---the black out, people dying in their own homes, all young men being military---this is what seemed most striking about the book. Juxtaposed against the backdrop of a world where none of the old promises hold true and where tomorrow may not come, friendship and romance become the proof of humanity. Since there is always a tendency to cling to the tattered shreds of the past in times of crisis, a romance that defies taboo is especially humane.But please, use British actors. Make them the right age, too. These are kids. If only Laurence Olivier was alive and young. I get the feeling that Ralph was modeled on him."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"As a young man still exploring my sexuality, The Charioteer fell into my hands. I might call it providence, for Mary Renault's novel, more than any other I have read, has affirmed me in my own journey...and challanged me. Her novel is not exclusively about homosexuality though, it is a novel about all people filled with compassion and insight. This book contains wisdom, for this reason it belongs on all &quot;must read&quot; lists."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"**spoiler alert** A review is not possible, not for me anyway, because the book is so rich and complex I don't think I have the means to write about it. Just a few thoughts.I can't explain how pervasive Laurie became page after page. I thought I was keeping an equal distance from him and the other characters, but when I got to the end, I realized I wasn't able to detach my point-of-view from his and he totally, totally convinced me of his perceptions, so much so that I thought Ralph had really spoken to Andrew. I read the last chapter with dread, shock, worry and being sorry and mortified.Laurie is divided between the love for Andrew, which Laurie seems to want to keep innocent and spiritual, and the love for Ralph, which is physical and brings with it the participation to a circle of gay men, that Laurie seems not to be able to accept, because it seems to exclude them from the rest of society.The writing is subtle and beautiful, it's not only to be read, but also to be contemplated. We are so used to being open, but the constant tension of what is said or left unsaid, because the concern for social propriety was so ingrained in the characters, makes you always hyper-aware of each word. There are moments of obscurity, but also moments of revelation. You are expecting something, and it happens under your eyes without you realizing it. You are in the dark, then the author sheds a light, until it becomes blinding.Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This is the only work of Renault's I have ever read - it was assigned in an undergraduate gay & lesbian literature class. I found the characters superb, exquisitely developed, highly believable. Renault's prose is a mixture of romantic lyricism and modern experimentation. A wonderful, moving love story. Dense, but very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Audio verison of this book is Excellent. The reader is a woman, whose name I can't recall. She does a great job. It seems strange at first, but then it flows very nicely. On Audio the Characters are even more real and Vivid. It's almost as if you were listening in on their dialoge. Since the book can be a hard read at times, this can be a great alternative."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"There's really not much to add to the other reviews, but I feel the need to put my two cents into the mix. This novel does several things extremely well: A)It illuminates the inner life of a thoughtful young gay man in England during the Second World War, B) It vividly portrays gay culture in London in the mid-20th century, C) It examines the conflict between heartfelt religious belief and genuine love in the life of a young conscientious objector, D) the author inserts a steady stream of insights regarding living a life of integrity as a gay person, and E) the writing style is typical of Renault: subtle, thoughtful, and elegant. I have returned to this novel on several occasions, and each time I have been thoroughly engrossed in the world Mary Renault creates for the reader."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"Mary Renault's The Charioteer is a partly-frosted window on a bygone time when homosexuality was \\"the love that dare not speak its name\\" in literature and real life. In lyrical prose she shares an engrossing story of three homosexual men interconnected by love yet experiencing extraordinary difficulty in their personal relationships. The raging Battle of Britain is only one of the sources of their troubles and not the most serious. Because the gay characters had not died by the end, the story was considered to be gay-positive for its time. A happy ending can be worked out by the alert reader, perhaps after a couple of re-reads.Renault employs creative literary devices to espouse a truth that related in less evasive fiction might have been suppressed in the 1950's, when the novel was written. (It was published in the US in 1959.) She has a flair for the artful metaphor and prose pregnant with hidden meanings. The careful reader will discover the ellipses in her tale, and particularly her character portrayals. The narrative is littered with lacunae which must be puzzled out (among them what sexual interactions transpired.) One of the most apt and telling phrases that turns up is the \\"hairpin drop,\\" now an obsolete concept. It means dropping a hint of one's homosexuality in a way that a straight person wouldn't pick up on, as of a time when being exposed as gay would ruin one's life. The hairpin drop is an equally serviceable metaphor for Renault's prose style. Even so, it is all done very tastefully and with great literary skill. British men of that age weren't expected to express their feelings except by indirection.The vividness with which Renault portrays the burdens placed on her gay characters by the repressive society in which they were trapped cannot but distress the sensitive, 21st century reader. The characters are beaten down by homophobia, a force so pervasive that it seldom needs to be pointed out. In my view, the book fails as romance because it is much too realist, and reality for gays in the mid-twentieth century was insufferable.The book received glowing reviews when it arrived in America in 1959, a little more than a decade after Gore Vidal had been shouted down for his unapologetic treatment of homosexuality in The City and the Pillar. It seems plausible that Renault's understated, elliptical storytelling style compromised in a way that made favorable reviews attainable. Unfortunately being well-attuned to the regressive intellectual sensibilities of the 50's puts the book at a disconnect with the 21st century. The Charioteer casts homosexuals as atomized, wounded individuals who find satisfying human relations only with the greatest difficulty, and at significant risk of bad things happening. The moral sometimes seems to be that gay men are their own worst enemies, albeit as a response to the hostile environment of that time.The Charioteer discreetly succeeded in putting the case for gay liberation way ahead of its time. Consider Mary Renault's evocation of the idea of gay \\"pride,\\" using that word, when her most insightful character makes a point by alluding to the prohibition of alcohol:You can't make good wine in a bathtub in the cellar, you need sun and rain and fresh air, you need a pride in the job you can tell the world about. Only you can live without drink if you have to, but you can't live without love.The pride this novel inspires comes in the realization that our movement has transformed the living conditions of LGBT people beyond all recognition since Stonewall. The Charioteer calls us to a history that makes the present all the more remarkable for how different it is."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"If it is possible for a novel to enhance a persons life, then 'The Charioteer' did that for me. I first read the book over 20 years ago and its effect was profound. Each time I have re-read it, further insights into the characters and the era have unfolded. I have spoken to gay men of that time who have read the book and they confirm the complexities of homsexual relationships as written by Ms Renault. How different the'scene' is half a century later - and then, how similar. Very different from her historical novels, 'The Charioteer' is a study of humanity that places her firmly in company of the greats! A classic!"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"Laurie Odell, injured during World War II, is transferred to a veterans hospital. There he meets and falls in love with a Quaker Hospital attendant, Andrew Raynes, an innocent young man who hasn't figured himself out yet. To complicate matters fate brings back into his life an old school friend, Ralph Lanyon, who is familiar with the pitfalls of being gay during that era and also develops feelings for him. Laurie, healing from his injury and at the crossroads of his life, must now make choices that will have a profound impact on his future.Woven within this modern love story are references to Greek mythology and Plato's Phaedrus showing that the human experience, especially the experience of love, transcends time and culture. Renault uses her lyrical style of writing to pack symbolism, hidden meanings, and innuendo into each page of the text. She reveals the hidden world of homosexual relationships during World War II filled with interpersonal drama. It is also a novel of self-discovery and finding ones place in the world, especially when the discovery leads to a moral dilemma and criminality (as it was at the time). The three main characters are at very different points in their lives at the start of the novel. Laurie is at a point right between discovery of why he feels different and acceptance of himself. Ralph is comfortable in, knowledgeable about, and has experience with different facets of homosexual relationships and community. Andrew is completely blind about his inclinations and is just beginning to realize he is different. Not only is Renault able to show a whole spectrum of experience through these three characters but the story takes on a life of its own as their three lives collide and intertwine. It is an amazing novel, don't let the four stars fool you, but after reading the magnificence that are some of her other works, this one doesn't seem as refined as her later novels. However, as I said, still completely and utterly brilliant."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"A small grey mouse slips from beneath the door sill, pauses a moment to fan silvery whiskers and smooth down velvet grey fur, then whispers:First one must thank the good folk at Amazon Shipping for their efforts. They said the book would get here on January 26th and it arrived on the 22nd. One is unable to express how much delight this actuated. So far, this one has re-read it three times since its arrival and plans to spend the weekend on a fourth and fifth visit into Ms. Renault's world.Now, who does not love to come home to old friends, knowing they will be more then welcome, and anticipating only the most wonderful reunion?One first read this book over thirty years ago, and is utterly enthralled to find thirty-odd reviews online concerning it. The horrible house ate one's copy about twelve years past and one has been hunting for a copy ever since, because one re-read it once a year up until the time the house held it hostage.At fifteen, this book was an epiphany, not merely for writing style to an aspiring author, but also for it's subtle and well crafted characterizations.Please meet Laurence Odell, child of divorce raised solely by his mother. After the age of five he never sees his father again. One follows Laurence - Laurie -through the most formative years of his life until the story settles. One sees his mother push out his father for allegedly cheating on her. One sees him in what we would call High School. He has developed a strong attachment to an older authority figure, R.R. Lanyon. More than a crush, less than a declared intent, Laurie is appalled and enraged when a friend announces that Lanyon is to be \\"sent up\\" (expelled) for immoral activities. Only Lanyon's admission that he is not innocent of the accusations pressed against him stops Laurie from Outing himself - completely unaware and unrealistic of the actual repercussions.Now it is 1940. One finds oneself observing am E.M.S. hospital in the countryside of nearby Bridstow. Laurence has had his kneecap shot off at Dunkirk and must be ignominiously rescued, as all the army was ignominiously rescued, by the navy. He has endured two surgeries to correct the big-gun wound and cannot walk without a crutch or cane. Laurie is a corporal, and comfortable with the other wounded vets who surround him. 'They are a touchy society' to quote the book, ' but they know it'. Enter into this makeshift hospital a batch of c.o.'s, Conscientious Objectors, to replace the orderly and maid staff who left after finding their placement too isolated. Now Laurie meets Andrew Raynes, a seventeen year old Quaker who has opted not to fight. A chaste romance blossoms on Laurie's side, and something seems to be blossoming in Andrew, but Laurie, remembering the lessons taught to him by Lanyon during their last interview seven years ago, cannot tell Andrew what he is and what he feels, because he does not wish to interfere with, or ruin Andrew's self perception.As this gentle romance meanders along, Laurie runs across a gay intern he played with long-distance, on an impulse. Sandy Reid invites Laurie back to a birthday party for his partner, one later meets Alec Deacon who is also an intern at the hospital. Laurie refuses twice, he has had a bad time at Oxford with a gay man he met, started to get to know, and rejected, but then Sandy Reid mentions Ralph Lanyon and Laurie is hooked. He ventures into the closed society of the homosexual men of the time...a time when blackmail is almost legal against gay men, a time when the laws are not on their side to say the least, a time when a gay bashing might be overlooked as the thing to do.At the party, Laurie is appalled to hear, and see, the flouncing, frisking gossips and nattering, jewelry sporting men who seem to have no sense of themselves beyond their sexuality and its confinements. He rejected this society at Oxford. He rejects it now. He almost leaves before Lanyon arrives. Lanyon does arrive but not before Alec informs Laurie that it was Lanyon's ship that picked him off the beach at Dunkirk, ostensibly saving his life, and Lanyon wrote to him after being wounded in the sinking of that ship a little later. Lanyon wrote, but the letter came back that Laurie had died of his wounds. Laurie is astounded, and somewhat flattered, to realize that he had Lanyon's attention even when he stank of decomposition and looked like all Hell.When Lanyon enters, an unquiet scene plays out that results in a particularly unpleasant event. Laurie and Ralph Lanyon are thrown together for the best part of the night, and they exchange any number of confidences as they begin to get to know one another as adults. It's too good to throw out spoilers, read it. The Romance has been thriving, unfed, in both of them for almost a decade. The pleasure of this book is watching them feel their way towards one another, with caution at first, then with determination unabridged on Ralph's part. The ending stops one's breath in one's throat. One likes these young men, and wishes them well, and is very much afraid how their conflicts with devolve: With or without resolution.Put aside certain details. This is a Romance in the old fashioned meaning of the word. A sweeping emotional Odyssey that covers the first half of two people's lives. Never mind they are gay men. Never mind the back drop of Bridstow, or the E.M.S. Hospital. Here we see humans striving to be worthy to both give and receive love despite all obstacles and social conventions. We want them to be worthy, and we strive right along beside them. I have left out a great many details because there are thirty-odd reviews before this one, and because one has only so much time. And because you should indulge yourself in this book, if you're reading this review then obviously you are interested. It will satisfy, as all Ms. Renault's works do. It is understated, skillfully woven, and always topical.Left, right, or center, it is always important that one make out as a human being.Someone in the reviews wants this to be a movie - I say mini-series on HBO or Showtime, but since so much of the book is internal and emotional, I worry it won't really make a good video presentation. I'd by a ticket, or rent it on line. How about a C.G. Peter O'Toole, back when he was young and spare and sharp as a knife?(Madly anthropomorphizing:) Smoothing back silver whiskers, the grey velvet mouse surveys the scene. Nodding once, it slips quickly back through the door sill and is gone."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Charioteer is a sympathetic portrait of the love triangle between three men who meet and fall in love in post-war London. The protagonist, Laurie Odell, was severely wounded during the battle of Dunkirk, and the novel explores his journey towards recovery. While in hospital north of London, Laurie meets Andrew, a Quaker indentured to the hospital due to his status as a conscientious objector. (Tell me you've read this, secretlybronte). The two men strike up a sweetly innocent and sexless romance based on their mutual isolation and barely-acknowledged queerness.Meanwhile, Ralph Lanyon (an older, more experienced man whom Laurie knew years ago at school) reenters Laurie's life, and Laurie is forced to chose between his innocent love for Andrew or his more overtly sexual yearning for Ralph. The novel features some interesting exploration of what love can mean when it's approached as a moral choice, but it also looks at issues of peace, cowardice and existential yearning. The Charioteer is a bit dated (the novel was published in 1959) and has some offensive characterization of men who are overtly effeminate, but it's beautifully written and incredibly forward-thinking in its treatment of gay themes."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"It's true that this marvelously written story (though often a slow read) is ONE BIG TEASE! Even in 1941 the \\"hidden\\" gay subculture in England was more available and well-known and far less \\"swishy\\" than Renault needs you to believe in order to hook you. And hook you she does! But poor Laurie, though hungrily Yearning to do so for years and years, does not even kiss (fully platonically) another male until, what, page 200-something?If you're prone to judge any/all books you read by today's \\"standards\\" of explicitness, directness and overt sexual detail please don't read this book and by all means do not criticize it by such guidelines. If you're \\"offended\\" by the normalization of gay male love, don't read this book, and by all means do not criticize it through that perspective. However, be sure to criticize it and react to it as a work of high literary value. But, please, all you homophobes out there simply zip your lips and keep your offended \\"sensibilities\\" to yourself. Let the rest of the world enjoy a moment of literary (if not cultural) sanity.Laurie, the hero, is hardly a son I would ordinarily have been proud of. He's not very manly, really, though he's quite intellectual. He often seems to lack backbone. He takes eons to decide ANYTHING of importance. And when push comes to shove, he more often than not denies his nature and wimps out. Pity. When unleashed, his mean side is shocking, his words hurtful, and of course his conscience causes him regret and anguish. He doesn't like his nasty side, and it obviously is a self-loathing projected onto others. But, though slow on the \\"uptake of self-awareness\\" and even slower to act upon self-revelations when they knock him about in the head, he nonetheless becomes a rather lovable creature and a son to embrace.Laurie also, for most of the book, has an unresolved and terrifyingly obvious and debilitating Oedipus complex. His thoroughly unlikable mother finally abandons him to a new husband late in the book, whereupon mere hours later, that very night, Laurie magically becomes an honest gay man, aged 23. His long-dominant complex vanishes (just like that!), thanks to one sensational night sleeping with Ralph, the anti-hero and main secondary character, the only guy who really and truly loves him.What Renault, an Oxford-educated woman cannot do in this fine book published first in 1959 is --- get truly inside the head of a sexually conflicted young man (either Laurie, or Andrew, his secret love interest). Getting inside Ralph, who is a much less subtle personality, she succeeds. But Mary Renault is not a gay man, and like someone who has never been imprisoned for years and years, she simply is mentally unable to correctly depict with any thoroughness what actually goes on inside the imprisoned body and brain of a gay male who cannot, is not, and will not be open, whether 1941, 300 BC, or 2008. Only someone \\"who has been there\\" has this capacity.But, the book is very good indeed! It's a wonderful, beautifully written tantalizing love story, giving readers a glimpse into Renault's view of an important subtext of 1940's British society. The war is merely a backdrop. The characters act out for her the awful truths about repression and suppression of self and the price all gay men everywhere in all eras pay for being people without full civil rights and true societal integration.Some nice sentences include these: Page 100. \\"You looked too absorbed to be true.\\" (That's Andrew speaking to Laurie.) Page 190. \\"For the first time he had a feeling of its being no longer in the background of his self-portrait.\\" (That's Laurie thinking about his injured knee.) Page 191. \\"This grave moment gave to the smile that followed an irresistible sincerity.\\"I have one big complaint. I honestly did not understand the last 3 pages, when Laurie \\"returns\\" to Ralph. It seemed to me that she must have written the ending 10 times, and finally chose one version at random. Renault's metaphor of the pair of white and black horses, when she makes a final connection to the concept of \\"Charioteer,\\" was too cute and too elusive to cause (in me anyway) a feeling of satisfaction on the last page of this otherwise fine novel. The finale was a huge let-down. So, not only for her consistent, unnecessary obtuseness throughout the novel, I rate this story a 3, because a) She failed to raise the gay characters sufficiently above stereotypes, and b) she simply could not write a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read the Charioteer ages ago. And I have reread it perodically. Mary Renault writes beautifully about the heartbreaking difficulty of finding and living with mature homosexual love. She goes beyond the superficial mannerisms and right to the issues of personality, commitment, caring, love and loneliness. Her book, more than any &quot;diversity&quot; training I have undertaken has taught me about the complexity of living outside of the mainstream and finding fulfillment in companionship. This goes beyond &quot;equality&quot; or &quot;gay rights&quot;, straight to the fundamental issues. And she does so with compassion, and brilliance."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"THE CHARIOTEER is the kind of storytelling that doesn't exist any more in the modern literary world. There's barely any plot, but instead an exploration of emotions, self-discovery, and desires. It's written in the style of utmost literary propriety, rather than that of modern colloquialism, which makes for lovely prose but a much more difficult read. I often found myself re-reading sentences two or three times to fully grasp the meaning.For those of you unfamiliar with the story, it is set in England in 1940. Laurie is a 23-year-old soldier convalescing from a serious leg wound in a veteran's hospital. He befriends a young conscientious objector/pacifist/Quaker, Andrew, working there as an orderly. Laurie understands the sexual undercurrent of their friendship, but Andrew does not. Then through a circumstance of fate, an old school chum, Ralph, enters the picture. He's a naval captain who has just lost his command and is now part of a small clique of gay men, most for whom he feels contempt though he relies on their communal support. Ralph, who has developed a dependence on alcohol to counter the effects of the war, finds in Laurie a salvation, while Laurie finds his love divided between two men. One with whom that love can be fully realized, and the other which must be protected and kept chaste, lest it be destroyed.What makes THE CHARIOTEER such a masterwork, is that Mary Renault found an ingenious way to infer a hidden meaning to so much of her text. As this was first published in 1953 when the literary world was not ready for full-on descriptions of homosexuality, I don't know whether she actually wrote more, and was censored by her superiors, or if she instinctively knew just how much she could get away with without crossing the line. A discerning reader can pick up all the little cues and know exactly what is missing.The wonderful depth is all due to the character development. Laurie and Ralph are real-life human beings. Andrew less so, but that is because he is relegated to the supporting cast. Every bit of dialog, every physical movement, every thought (and there are some lovely flourishes of humor in Laurie's stray thoughts) plays to perfection without a single false note. The yearnings, fears, confusion and joys are absolutely genuine and I wouldn't trade a second of it for a slam-bang action-oriented plot.For anyone professing to be a student of seminal gay fiction, or historical gay fiction, THE CHARIOTEER is imperative reading."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I realize I've already written a review of The Charioteer but while perusing other customer reviews I came across a review which made me realize why I love this book so much. It is because ever since I finished the book for the first time back in 1986, I can't get Laurie and Ralph out of my head. They became so real to me upon that first reading that I have been compelled to return to the book again and again if only to spend a few more moments with some old friends. There are only a few other fictional characters I feel so close to, and none as much as these two."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This is, bar none, my favorite book. It must be; I've read it at least a dozen times over the years, and I walk away from it with something new each and every time.Renault is a mistress of sublime subtlety, and she says as much through artistic uses of pauses and silence and the absence of words as she does with every finely-honed phrase. Each of her characters is beautifully human: Laurie, the frustrated invalid coming to terms with his identity and his emotions; Ralph, a man living a painfully British life \\"of quiet desperation;\\" Andrew, the innocent; the cagey yet well-meaning Alec; the immature and demanding Sandy; cruel and calculating Bunny... all of these characters and more are thrown together by fate and circumstance after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940-- Britain's finest hour-- as they attempt to make sense of love and war.The Charioteer is successful on every level-- as a brilliant piece of historical fiction, as poetic literature, as an etude on the themes of the Iliad, and, perhaps most importantly as a timeless story of love among the ruins and the power of hope ... It is truly an underrated masterpiece of 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read The Charioteer first in mid 1960s when it was first gay book I had ever seen. It changed my views of gay lifestyles in a very positive way. For years I was afraid to reread it in case it disappointed me but when I finally did so I finished it in 24 hours and then read it again. Well written, supportive, affirming and hopeful. A remarkable book for one written in early 1950s"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Charioteer reminded me very much of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen, in theme rather than style. Renault's aversion to the sexual tribalists is very much apparent by the end of the book; it parallels Austen's disdain for romanticism. The book is eminently readable, if a bit slow (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for its tendency to be a tedious read at times). The potential reader will get more out of this novel if he/she has a good grasp of Plato (especially the Phaedrus). In any case, Renault's departure from her powerful historical fiction set in Ancient Greece is a positive thing; The Charioteer is among Mary Renault's finest."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I also read this book several years ago and just returned to it. It was even better than I remembered!It is a subtle and tightly written book which needs to be read carefully but is WELL worth the effort.

A long-time fantasy of mine is that Merchant/Ivory would make it into a British TV mini-series. If you like this book, you will probably also enjoy &quot;Maurice&quot; by E. M. Forster."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I found this book by doing a little research into what is considered \\"quality Gay Fiction.\\" When I first started reading I was a little surprised at first at how antiquated the writing style was and I suspected that I might not have the patience to read a book that requires the effort of rereading some sentences to get the point. However, I was immediately drawn into the characters and kept at it. By the last half of the book I was in love with all 3 of the main characters, appreciative of the authors beautifully nuanced writing and caught in the exquisite agony of tearing though every page to find out what happens while dreading the end of my time with these characters. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This was the best novel I have ever read! This story is about what love between two people really is.

Admiral Renata Colby, now a science adviser and her coxswain MacKenzie are on a scientific mission. They are the guests of new members to the Council of Worlds, the Harami, when the shuttle they are in crashes on Sacorra 6.The Harami have been changing the climate on Sacorra 6, to make it more suitable for themselves, they need a very warm climate, warmer than what would be comfortable for humans. The two Harami piloting the shuttle die in the crash, and Colby and MacKenzie are injured.The next morning, they discover that there was something the Harami forgot to mention to the Council of Worlds. Sacorra 6 is a planet that cannot be scanned for life forms, but Sacorra 6 is already inhabited by the People. People who claim be descendants of people from a place called Terra, Earth.These people are living at the tribal level and are appalled that Colby and MacKenzie have spent the night alone together, when they are not mated. A hasty wedding ceremony follows, and Colby and MacKenzie have no choice but to go along with the charade in order to stay alive, but as time goes on and no sign of rescue, they come to trust one another and love one another, even though Colby has a lover back home, a female lover, and she is sure the People wouldn't be too pleased to hear about that.As the months pass, the planet is heating up and they realise that the human life will not survive there for much longer, nor will any Harami, their climate changing has spiralled out of control and they are all in danger. And then they discover why nearly every shuttle trying to land on Sacorra 6 crashes...Although a science fiction novel, the plot doesn't get too much involved with lots of scientific jargon that is difficult to understand, instead it features more on the characters and how they interact with each other in a place with people so much more different than themselves.It's a well written book, with a depth of characters that you come to care about and worry what will happen to them.

The ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook 4th Edition, by David Hoyle is one of the best I have read on this subject. In this 4th edition, David analyzes each section, clause and requirement of the ISO 9001:2000 standard in detail.David Hoyle has over 30 years experience in quality Management and has authored or co-authored more than five books on ISO 9000. He is also the director of Transition Support, a firm that provides training and consulting in business improvement.The book is easy to understand and is suitable for students, managers, instructors as well as auditors. The novice ISO practitioner as well as the seasoned ISO 9000 enthusiast will find this book a valuable tool when implementing ISO 9000 quality management systems. For those making the transition from the 1994 version of the standard, this book helps to point out the changes from the 1994 to the 2000 standard.The standard has changed considerably. In the 4th edition, the meaning of each of the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard is explained in detail and some of the sometimes confusing ISO language is clarified. The author explains why each of the requirements is necessary. He shows how each requirement links to the eight quality management principles on which the ISO 9001:2000 standard was based. The book gives practical guidance on implementing each requirement. This is the strong point of the book.After introducing some basic quality concepts, the book explains the role, the origins and application of the ISO 9000 family. The succeeding chapters, 4 through 8, correspond to each of the five sections of the standard. This makes it easy when looking for help in understanding and implementing a certain requirement of the standard.The 4th edition has a summary, a questionnaire that provides food for thought for the reader, and a list of references at the end of each chapter. A glossary and a list of related websites are included in the appendix.The 4th edition of ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook will find a permanent place on your desk. Auditors will find this book indispensable."},{"Title":"Iso 9000 Quality Systems Handbook","review":"Contrary to the views of another reviewer, this book is not out of date.The ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook (Nov. 15, 2001) is an in-depth presentation of the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard. I purchased five other books that offered an interpretation of the standard, and all were brief and incomplete by comparison.&quot;What on earth do they mean by that?&quot; is the most common statement that people make when working with the ISO standard. This book presents each requirement in the standard and then tells, 1.) What it means, 2.) Why it is necessary, and 3.) How it is implemented. The explanation is complete and easily understood by anyone. A product like this is what is needed to understand what to do, and how to go about doing it when working with the ISO 9001:2000 standard. Companies transitioning to the new standard are assisted with a comparison of requirements to the prior standard.This book was recommended to me by an ISO 9000 registrar auditor who stated that it is being used as part of the training for their own auditors. I am a writer of ISO 9001 auditing materials. To prepare my own product, I found it necessary to read what was available in the marketplace that explained the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard.

This book gives you a good understanding of the requirements of the standard.When I wrote my quality manual in line with ISO 9000:1994 I found the book Indispensable, as the standard required you to comply with the clauses of the standard, and most people (my self included) wrote their quality manual in line with those requirements. This was OK until the new requirement came out in September 1999. Now the standard has changed from the clause approach to the processes approach. This is saying there must be a link between processes i.e. if one processes does not fulfils its requirement, then you cannot proceed to the next stage of the process. The overall message is that you \\"must satisfy your customer requirements\\".How do you go about changing the way you now write your quality manual, that is easily answered you read David Hoyle's 4th edition ISO 9000:2000 \\"Quality System Handbook \\" this is the one with the picture of the pearl on the front.

Within each clause of each section there is a an explanation of what it means, why it is necessary and how it is implemented. Each section ends with a summary, Questionnaire and a food for thought page.Anybody who is serious about implementing ISO 9000:2000 should have a copy at hand, I have only had mine since October and is already well thumped. A must, for all quality professionals."},{"Title":"Iso 9000 Quality Systems Handbook","review":"ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook FOURTH Edition has been completely revised to incorporate the new requirements specified in ISO9000:2000.If you only ever buy one book on ISO9000:2000 this is definitively the text to acquire. David Hoyle skillfully takes ISO9001:2000 and explains it in an easy to read, thoughtful and challenging manner. Instead of simply achieving ISO9001:2000 certification as a \`badge on the wall' Hoyle defines a road-map to improve your business and generally raise the \`bar' on your performance. We can always do more with less !The early sections of the book introduce the basic concepts of quality management and focuses on some key questions to be asked when making the transition from procedural based systems to performance measured systems. The differences between ISO9001:1994 and 2000 are then succinctly defined and explained with clarity.The balance of the book dissects each of the new 8 Sections in ISO9001:2000 and applies a consistent format : per discrete element : (1) what does the requirement mean (2) why is the requirement necessary (3) how is the requirement implemented ! A useful sidebar indicates what exactly has changed from ISO9001:1994 to 2000 : What more could you ask for !!In summary this and all books by David Hoyle (I have them all !) is excellent. If you are serious about getting real value from your investment in ISO9000 then don't start your initial registration (or transition) project without this book. You will not be disappointed.Finally be sure to only buy the FOURTH edition as for obvious reasons all prior editions apply to the 1994 edition...."},{"Title":"Iso 9000 Quality Systems Handbook","review":"The material was just what I was looking for and the service from Amazon was excellent.

It was a war fought with limited objectives where the political process was involved with the fighting. While there was a desire to win, there was the ever present feet that the war could grow to World War III fought with nuclear weapons if the Soviet Union felt her basic interests threatened.During the last two years of the war, truce talks were being conducted at the same time the war was being fought. Both sides tried with some success to induce more reasonable negotiating attitudes in their adversaries through the application of limited military pressure.This book is the story of fighting while talking during the last years of the war. It is the official history written by the Army. It was written with access to all of the information available to the Army, except of course classified documents.Of particular interest to me was following the negotiations. The style of the Communists worked well up against the representatives of a democracy who had political leaders back at home putting constraints on the outcome and journalists reporting everything back to the people. This kind of set the stage for the Viet Nam peace talks much later."},{"Title":"The Right Way to Knit a Manual for Basic Knitting","review":"Another one of my Mom's golden gifts to me.

The title and cover picture appear determined and sombre. Surely not another joyless, rule-laden, guilt-inducing diatribe for parents and caregivers! Indeed, not!

This is a culture that is vanished completely, both in England, with the class distinctions and 'public school' and in Africa and elswhere, where colonial societies have vanished.A brilliant study of a philandering wealthy society in the 'Happy Valley' settlement in Kenya, the 'White highlands' and the sort of folk who immigrated their. It examines the death of Lord Errol, a man of many disguises who loved not only women but also marriage to increase his wealth. This murder upset the small colony when it took place in 1941 and was a great scandal.This picture painted by this book is brilliant and loving, touching, interesting, history and novel rolled into one.Seth J.

I recommend it to anyone with an interest in unsolved murders or British Colonies."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"I am fascinated by the shenanigans of this group of English upper class people misbehaving in Kenya....the movie was good, too. But the book gives much more detail."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"The 1941 murder of Lord Erroll in Kenya would seem an irresistible subject for a writer: Erroll, an extremely handsome cad given to all number of vices, was gunned down one night and left in the wild after publicly cuckolding a fellow hereditary peer. The atmopshere of colonialist decadence the story provides is incredibly heady, and the first part of Fox's work detailing the central cast of characters and the murder itself has a real lurid charm (and it also provided the focus of the 1987 film version of the book with Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi). But then the book gets immersed in the trial of the cuckolded husband, Sir Jock Delves Broughton, and begins to get mired down in all manner of details that become very dull. Then near the midway point, Fox then details how his mentor, Cyril Connolly, became obsessed with Lord Erroll's murder and decided to write a book about it. Connolly is himself almost as much of a snob as the decadent aristocrats of Kenya's happy Valley implicated in the crime, and Fox too seems addicted to dropping names right and left. You become so lost in the sea of titled names that you begin to lose all interest in what otherwise would seem to be a can't-fail topic."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"Ever since I saw the movie \\"White Mischief\\", I've wanted the book, and now I have it. Book is in excellent condition and was received super quick!Thanks a lot."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"This is a simply fascinating book for anyone interested in colonial Africa, murder mysteries and just plain good writing. The author James Fox, an erudite Eton graduate, does much more than simply describe the wild African setting, the fascinating murder involved and the absurdly decadent lifestyle of the characters involved. He also tracks the process of his research and the input of the quirky British author, Cyril Connelly who simultaneously studied the events at hand.Fox uses the murder of man-about-town Lord Erroll as a backdrop to chronicle the deterioration of a British subculture in the early 1900's. While war was being waged in Europe, this group of moneyed and titled hedonists (who left their kiddies back home) lived a surrealistic life of partying, drinking, drugging and partner swapping. Such a detached lifestyle virtually requires a murder or two as a logical conclusion.Although the accused, Lord \\"Jock\\" Delves Broughton, is aquitted in an African trial (with lots of perjury involved) Fox makes no secret of his opinion that Boughton was the culprit. That does not dampen the book one bit because it is the cast of characters and how they talk about each other that is the best part of the book. The only problem I had with Fox's ultimate theory is that he bases it upon an interview with an eccentric, elderly woman who was only 15 years old at the time of the crime. Although she claims the suspect confessed the crime to her immediately after its commission, she did not reveal that alleged fact to anyone until Fox interviewed her in the 1980's. As a legal professional, I find that kind of evidence inherently not credible. This woman had plenty of opportunity to reveal the alleged confession on many prior occasions and Fox's reasons for her failure to do so are a bit far-fetched.This slight criticism does not in any way demean the entire book however as the rest of Fox's research and conclusions based thereupon seem sound.All in all, this is a fascinating book that is hard to put down. The peripheral characters such as Alice de Janze and Lord Soames are equally as intriguing as the main characters."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"Fox does an outstanding job in researching the murder of Lord Erroll in compiling this book, which reads like an Agatha Christie mystery. The first half of the book looks at the actual murder of Lord Erroll in Kenya in 1941. This has all the elements of a good mystery -- money, luxury, pride, sex, jealousy, etc. The second half of the book is an intricate examination of the evidence and Fox's own investigation into the murder mystery. Although one might wonder while reading this how Fox will &quot;solve&quot; his mystery, he presents his material in such a way that will keep the reader turning pages."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"James Fox takes the reader into the world of 1941's Happy Valley crowd of Nairobi, Kenya to explore the murder of of Jossyln Hay, Earl of Erroll. The Earl, better known as Joss, was a member of the upper-class enclave of English colonials living in Kenya at the time of WWII. A lady's man, Joss Hay, like many of the Happy Valley set, ignored the &quot;rules&quot; of society, and indulged himself with who ever caught his eye, married or not. He was found, on the morning of January 24, shot through the head, in a car near Happy Valley. This account of a true story, resurfaces all the decadence and indulgence that is a major force of history of Nairobi's colonial society. A suspect was brought to trial, but the case was never resolved. Mr. Fox, years later, examines the evidence of the trial, interviews survivors, and escorts the reader through the process of investigation to discover who really pulled the trigger and why. A riveting look at a pageantry of trash, this book reads like a superb mystery story."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"What a useless bunch these young and handsome Brits were! Ensconced in a valley in Kenya they named Happy Days during the '30s, they transformed what had been a laudable pioneering community less than 30 years before into a cesspool worthy of a Somerset Maugham play. Parties lasted for days, wife swapping was endemic, alcoholism and drugs were the norm and the motto was \\"Party On!\\"The main surprise of Lord Erroll's murder, shot in the head while sitting in his car was that anyone cared enough, was passionate enough to carry out the dastardly deed. Lord Erroll was involved with the former Diana Caldwell, Lady Broughton. They had not been discreet, and it was an activity he had been perfecting for years. You could safely say adultery was the rule, rather than an aberration. Lord Broughton was arrested, tried and found not guilty. The evidence was flimsy, Lord Broughton was a calm and credible witness, and there it ended. The question was if Broughton wasn't the murderer, who was? The first half of the book acquaints us with the players and the crime. The second half is the sleuthing that the author and the late Cyril Connelly did to solve the crime thirty years after the fact.The book is interesting and moves at a good pace. I had to smile at the author's obvious enchantment with Lady Diana. He finally met her when she was in her late sixties, and her charm was as potent as ever. The story has \\"movie\\" written all over it, and a highly successful film was made in the early '80s. My problem with the book is I never could mind much about either the suspects or the victim. They were all equally unlikable, so solving the crime was not compelling. Mr. Fox has done a good job of marshalling the facts and digging out the clues. He has me convinced his conclusion is the right one. If I only cared, I would be more enthused.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"If you ever had any royalist sentiment -- or harbored a feeling that British aristocrats are superior beings -- this book should cure you. The characters of \\"White Mischief\\" are about the most disgusting and useless bunch of parasites that can be imagined.\\"White Mischief\\" is about a murder in colonial Kenya in 1941 and the people who were involved in the case. The murderee was Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Errol, and the accused murderer was Sir John Henry Delves Broughton. This book is an examination of the free and easy \\"Happy Valley\\" society that both belonged to, a recapitulation of the trial, and an examination of the evidence. The author's investigation, carried out over decades, includes interviews with people connected with the case, including the loathsome Diana, wife of the accused murderer and mistress of the murderee -- and a strong candidate among others to be the mastermind of the affair. (As this book, although non-fiction, is something of a murder mystery, I won't spoil it by revealing the author's conclusions as to who killed Lord Errol.)It's a crackin' good story, set in the splendid \\"White Highlands\\" of Kenya. To me \\"White Mischief\\" is also a cautionary tale of what happens when a privileged minority is allowed to run wild.Smallchief"},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"Of the many reasons you may have for reading this book, you must not pick it up to learn who murdered Josslyn Hay, Earl of Errol. James Fox will give you all the facts and then let you decide. As Fox points out, \\"there were many people in Kenya who had a motive for killing Errol, and many who had the opportunity that night.\\" To this day it remains an unsolved crime, a \\"cold case,\\" dating to 1941. But when Fox and his Sunday Times Magazine colleague, Cyril Connolly, began their investigations, in 1969, there were still several people living who were personally involved in the case. Connolly and Fox, working together left no stone unturned, and wrote up their findings in the Sunday Times Magazine. But credit Fox, convinced that there were still facts to learn, for returning to the case after Connolly's death.By the time we turn the last page, we know the whereabouts of every person on a minute to minute basis throughout the night Lord Errol was shot in the head at close range and left on the floor of his car in a ditch. We know their drugs of choice, the calibers of their pistols, their alibis, and their manifold motives. Certainly the preponderance of evidence points to Lord Jock Delves Broughton (pronounced Brawton), whose wife had been Lord Erroll's latest conquest. Broughton, however, was released on lack of evidence.It was, however, precisely because Fox was so familiar with the case, more so than most of the actual protagonists, that he was able to approach Broughton's widow, Diana, Lady Delamere, and chat with her in 1981, forty years after the murder. Fox gained her confidence and he eventually learned her own theory as to the murder's identity.Fox gives us descriptions of stunning clarity of the Kenyan landscape, the society of Happy Valley, the Muthaiga Club, and the personalities which peopled the drama which so obsessed him as it had his colleague, Connolly, before him. We owe Fox a debt of gratitude for his renderings of wartime Kenyan colonial society, which, were it not for the murder of Lord Erroll, may well have faded from memory and history with the passage of time. Fox has documented more than a murder; he has preserved a slice of history forever, and it is a deliciously salacious history at that."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"Interesting and easy read - Fox has done his research well. My late husband's parents were Kenya settlers and his father had NO respect for the Happy Valley crowd AT ALL. Fox has certainly filled in many of the gaps left in the story my husband, Len Gill told me and has introduced me to a new side of some of the characters Len knew. I only wish I had read this book before my husband died of cancer. So many questions - so little time for answers."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"This is one of the best murder mysteries I have ever read. Even to this day there is no real evidence as to who murdered Lord Errol. I personally couldn't give a toss if the characters are 'snobs' because the fact that they are titled and decadent only adds to the excitement of the plot. He brought to life a murder that many of us had not heard of. Some of these people lived in such isolated areas that it would be easy to forget what was happening in the rest of the world. I think the research was excellent and the fact that he used Cyril Connoly's notes was important. It is easy to see why this book has been so successful and sold so many copies throughout the world. Would recommend it highly and like the book 'Out of Africa' is so much better than the film"},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"I am so glad that I got this out of the library rather than purchasing it used. The first part deals with the actual story of the murder of Lord Erroll, the last is a sort of paean to his apparent mentor and research partner, Cyril Connolly. The first section is adequately written. The second, appalling. From his description of Cyril, the fellow did not deserve such devotion. Sounded like a bit of a slothful, lazy, boring, elitist, intimidator and extremely rude guest. I found the second half unreadable.Whereas, I found Frances Osborne's memoir of her grandmother, Idena Sackville, in England and Kenya, fascinating and well written. Idena was the first wife of Lord Erroll, and the one who convinced him to go to Kenya in the first place. (The Bolter: Idina Sackville, the Woman Who Scandalised 1920s Society and Became White Mischief's Infamous Seductress) This one is definitely a 4 star book. It gives much greater insight into the periods from the close of the Edwardian age, WWI, the excesses of the 20's, the breakdown of the 30's and WWII on the British social system."},{"Title":"White Mischief","review":"If you're a history buff - especially British history - you won't go wrong with this book.

The author, James Fox, does an excellent job in setting the stage and introducing the characters in one of the most fascinating eras of the 20th Century - complete with the wild lifestyles, drugs, plenty of booze and orgies that the Happy Valley crowd were addicted to. Its unofficial leader was, Joss Hay, Lord of Errol, with his wife, Idina who used to host parties while reclining nude in her bathtub before the games began. Hay, a notorious womanizer, was killed in a yet unsolved murder in 1941; according to rumor, Nairobi still talks about it over seventy years later.

The writing is quite efficient, and with little repetition it is a useful primer for anyone studying post-colonial (or colonial) literature, especially if your studies have an emphasis on the West Indies.There are problems, however. The text is riddled with careless spelling and grammatical errors, so much so that it does not look as though it has been proof-read. Amon has some good ideas, but his writing is tainted by continual need to criticise colonial practices. Anyone reading at this level will already have formed their opinions about the merits or otherwise of colonialism and needs to know about the literature, not the politics.There are some good historical observations and local information that may not otherwise be available, and the informal style lacks the academic pretentiousness which taints so many books on this subject.A useful book, but the errors marred my enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"The Rise of New York Port, 1815-1860","review":"A marvel...a must read for anyone interested in the port of New York. I was fortunate to find a copy in a library I will not name for fear it might be stolen. Last time I checked the New York Public Library had a non-circulating copy in a distant branch, but that's not where I found it.This book was written a long time ago, and I'm amazed at the detailed research the author included in his work. Anyway, the author says the rise of the port cannot be attributed to the opening of the Erie Canal. Instead, the relative advantages of the port of New York compared with Boston, and Philadelphia are 1. It's closeness to the open ocean (ships out of Boston had to first clear Cape Cod, and ships out of Philadelphia had to first cross the length of Delaware Bay) 2. Two different approaches to the port...the Narrows and Hell Gate.

Each member makes a deposit of which 25% must be in the form of Gold or hard currency, this is called their quota. A member may receive a loan up too three times their quota amount. In an emergency the IMF could approve loans that exceed the 3X quota amount. The IMF central role is too provide policies and resources that give confidence to its members, make available emergency funds offsetting a financial panic, correct maladjustments in balance of payments between nations, and preventing destruction of national and international stability. IMF credibility is their contrarian's superiority providing advice and mandating policies forcing troubled countries too become more efficient and less corrupt. These governments would maintain their control over capital control. However, IMF can not control the inflow and outflow of foreign money. Fast growing countries like Thailand opened their financial systems to hot money. Hot money characteristics were a temptation that could turn into a panic because the money could be quickly be liquidated as a punishment for underperformance.In the 90s, emerging markets trend was towards ending capital controls. Banks were acting strangely. Banks were increasing loans, at the same time as, the portfolio investors were retreating and selling out positions. 1992, the US Treasury Bond was below 6%. Investors were tempted by yield chasing seeking double digit yields in Malaysia. Japan was one of the strongest investor. Many of these investors borrowed low cost money from home markets and invested it into higher yield emerging market securities capturing 15 to 23% yields. This sets the stage for disaster in Thailand.1997, Thailand central bank was armed with $38 billion in reserve dollars. The Thailand central bank believed $38 billion was more money than the speculator would be willing to bet against the baht. But through 1997, speculation increased against the baht as investors borrowed money to sell short on the currency betting that the currency would drop and they could buy back at cheaper levels. The Thailand central bank could defend the baht by raising interest rates increasing bond and bank deposit appeal. The second way to defend the Baht was to enter foreign currency exchanges and pump up the demand for the currency. The Bank of Thailand did a lot of buying because it was obligated to keeping the exchange of one dollar to 25 baht. Buying baht reduced the amount of Baht in circulation in the Thailand economy.The Bank of Thailand was too clever by engaging in a currency swap. A swap involves a promise by participates too buy or sell a currency for another with a promise to trade the currencies back after a certain amount of time. The Bank of Thailand swap secretly amount to $23 billion. The Bank of Thailand reported that they had plenty of dollars for business. Problem solved! However, when the swap reversed the Thailand bank would be scarce of dollars to make payments on foreign loans come due. Most of the reserve dollars were committed for future transactions. The market continued selling short and the bank could not beat back the speculators. The Bank of Thailand had one more weapon, the Bank of Thailand order all 29 local and foreign banks to stop lending baht to foreigners. The baht would cease to flow outside of Thailand. Then suddenly Thai banks and corporations began selling baht in exchange for dollars to pay back short-term debts coming due. Foreign creditors were demanding immediate repayment of their loans when they came due. The Bank of Thailand could not cover the frantic baht selling and dollar buying, they did not have enough dollars in reserve.The IMF demanded the Thai government create a budget surplus by increasing the value-added tax from 7 percent to 10 percent. The IMF insisted that Thailand devalue their currency and devaluation made increased exports and cheapened imports for foreign countries. The Thai economy did not need monetary tightening; the GDP dropped 10 percent and growth went to zero. Thailand was experiencing a recession. Unemployment rose to 6 percent. Thailand had banking system structural problems. Bank of Thailand had secretly loan $20 billion to ailing financial institutions attempting to stabilize these banks and prevent runs on deposits. The IMF insisted the Bank of Thailand stop the secret bailouts. IMF smartens up and supported a comprehensive guarantee on deposits and liability of financial institutions. Japan rescued Thailand with a $4 billion loan matching the IMF loan of $4 billion. The complete Thai bailout package totaling $17.2 billion."},{"Title":"Thailand's Boom and Bust: Revised Edition","review":"This book attempts to show the Thai economy both before and after the \\"blood baht\\" of 1997.

At times it is too superficial, but overall it is an excellent introduction to the topic. The primary theme is that the war accelerated and definitively established the mixed economy seen in the U.S. today. (A mixed economy is one where some goods and services are provided by private enterprise and others, usually basic infrastructure goods and services, are supplied by the government.)Particularly good is Vatter's description of the transition from a civilian to a military economy. This began in March 1941 with the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Military expenditures in the United States went from $1.8 billion in 1940 to $6.3 billion in 1941. One year later they were a whopping $22.9 billion. During this same period, military personnel on active duty increased from half a million people in 1940 to four million in 1942.The immediate result of this war economy, and the concomitant explosion in total federal expenditures, was the end of the Great Depression. Expenditures increased so rapidly that the federal deficit more than doubled as a percentage of GNP from 1939 to 1941. This Keynesian \\"anti-depression medicine\\" finally ended twelve years of mass unemployment. Only the onset of war was sufficient to bring into operation Keynesian deficit spending of sufficient magnitude to accomplish this.The war years saw a boom in the United States economy of remarkable proportions. From 1940 to 1942 industrial production increased by 58 percent. Total productivity increased by 16.5 percent from 1941-1945. The number of unemployed, which stood at over eight million in 1940, dropped to only one million in 1943. The number of women employed increased by a third (5.2 million individuals), to the point where they comprised approximately one third of the civilian labor force and enjoyed a 36.3 percent participation rate, at the time a historic high.This huge upturn in the economy was accompanied by (some would argue, caused by) the creation of a huge, bureaucratic administration designed to oversee various sectors of the economy. The focus of the new bureaucracy was on production, distribution, pricing, and labor. Towards that end, an alphabet soup of 165 new agencies was created, among them the WPB (War Production Board), OPA (Office of Price Administration), OPM (Office of Production Management), and WMC (War Manpower Commission). Many of these agencies had overlapping and even competing functions, and their record was certainly mixed, but Vatter believes that their performance was crucial to the functioning of the economy. Somewhat amazingly, after the war ended virtually all of these bureaucracies were dissolved. However-and this is the most important part-the success of the wartime economic planning provided the justification for a new, ongoing role for Big Government in the economic affairs of the nation. The United States was never to return to the laissez-faire policies of the pre-depression era. From this point on, the federal government was to assume a crucial role in the supply and distribution of goods and services, hence the creation of the mixed economy.Along with this crucial change, the war had several other consequences as well: full employment; technological innovation (e.g., radar, nuclear power, new pharmaceuticals); population growth (the \\"Baby Boom\\"); and the increased labor force participation of women. None of these, however, were nearly so important as the result mentioned above."},{"Title":"The U.S. Economy in World War II (Columbia Studies in Business, Government, and Society)","review":"I needed this book for a class in college.

In his usual folksy style, Snyder takes us up Pacific Coast Highway, where the golden coast of California is kissed by the sea. This book reads like a warm cup of chocolate yet features insightful vignettes about where to go, what to see, and how to see it all in style. PCH Traveler's Guide is much more than just a travel book. Snyder, who is sensitive to California's natural beauty and fragile ecology, tells readers where to shoot the best photographs, find the best tasting food, meet the most interesting people, and bed down in the sweetest places. Having lived in California for over 30 years, I was astonished to read of places I'd never seen, and the stories behind them. Inspired by PCH Traveler's Guide, my family is planning a road trip this summer to re-experience the coast's beauty and history .

I've read the reviews below and wondered if we were talking about the same book. Contrary to other opinions, this book does have an index, does make recommendations for unique and interesting lodging options, and is just packed with little bits of history about each area along the way. And the title of the book does say \\"Travelers Guide (Photographic Tour)\\" so do expect some stunning photographs along with the suggestions for enjoying the trip. If you're looking for phone numbers, prices and hours of operation, I would suggest a local phone book or a AAA road atlas rather than this engagingly written little guidebook. I would recommend it to anyone, actually everyone, who is interested in exploring the coast at their leisure and in their own style. Being a single woman and not having a huge amount of money to spend on vacations, I found that taking the Amtrak train, as suggested in this book, from rainy Seattle to sunny California was simply enchanting. For one thing, the Amtrak method of travel is relatively inexpensive, very safe and leaves a lot of time for thoughts and musings along the way (much preferable to being focused on traffic and searching out gas stations when driving). And the scenery can't be beat! It brings to mind bygone times when the trip was the destination - the little historical notes and anecdotes peppered throughout the book are a wonderful backdrop for experiencing the full flavor and character of each area.

Now, he takes travelers on a new journey along the Pacific Coast Highway from Southern California to the Pacific Northwest. Wisely, the author has not burdened the reader with details, such as tour hours and prices, telephone numbers and local tourism references that often change. (Almost every motel, restaurant and tourist attraction the length of the Pacific Coast has racks of brochures and pamphlets with up-to-date information. Also, this type of information is included in the various auto club tour guides, which are free to members and updated annually.) Instead, the author focuses on roadside icons, historic restaurants and inns, and the kinds of stories that would otherwise missed by travelers, all while allowing the traveler to see the Pacific Coast from the slower pace of a two-lane highway. Snyder spins history and pop culture into a delightful read and a worthwhile guide to one of the most scenic and fun stretches of highway to be found anywhere. James R.

Vol. 1","review":"It's a bit pointless to review just one volume of a serialized manga, particularly one like this that really develops its continuity over its entire length. This can be a problem with manga books because if you like a series, you'll end up spending something like $100 or more to get the whole story.In Japan, I've heard, they have Manga Cafes in which one can sit and read tankouban (as these collected volumes of previously serialized material are called). But a story like BLAME! deserves to be owned because of 1) the complexity of the storyline, and 2) the striking dark beauty of the artwork.One of the things I enjoy most about Blame! is the way Nihei (trained as an architect) manages to create sublime images of calamitous, anarchic architectural spaces that are by turns claustrophobic and cavernous. And the substantial emotional impact of these spaces (the entire story, thus far, takes place within an oppressively infinite INTERIOR space) comes across magnificently even on these relatively small pages.The story and characters are engaging as well, and in a way that binds them tightly to the space that surrounds them. Nihei succeeds in visualizing and \\"narrativizing\\" philosophical concepts about the interplay of (in)organic technologies and human(?) biology that rivals or even exceeds (or maybe it's just in a totally different dimension from) Shirow Masamune's (Ghost in the Shell) most interesting work - only without the \\"sexy\\" cyborg crotch shots on every page. And Nihei also achieves this without relying on tons of words on the page. His art speaks volumes - the linework is paradoxically crisp and filthy at the same time, and his sense of pacing is unparalleled - a breathtaking balance of panel-dense and show-stopping splash pages.Lucky for us, there's alot more of Nihei's work currently available in Japan - just waiting to be translated for us English speakers (including a sequel to Blame! called Net Sphere Engineer)."},{"Title":"Blame! Vol. 1","review":"When manga was first getting imported to the US market, you could pretty much trust that everything that hit the stands was decent, since the first books to get translated were the cream of the crop. Then, we started to see the real diversity of titles available in Japan, and, unfortunately, with diversity also comes a certain level of mediocrity.Fortunately, there are still treasures out there for those willing to look for them, and BLAME! is one of those treasures. With unique artwork, a sinister and cryptic tale unfolds slowly before you and captures your attention in a way few manga can these days.The first volume just misses the five star mark simply for the slow ramp-up, but it's worth it. I equate this first volume with the very first of Stephen King's Dark Tower books - it's a necessary intro, albeit a little clunky."},{"Title":"Blame! Vol. 1","review":"I've been interested in BLAME! ever since I found an art book on an import website. After readint through the volumes in Japanese, I must say I wasn't let down. This series is easily one of my favorites. Unfortunately, It also takes a while to get going.The ten volume series tells the story of Killy as he wanders through the what was once the earth, and now is a gigantic city known as the megastructure which grows out of control. Despite it being a city, few humans are to be seen due to an infestation of beings known as Silicon Creatures (essentially cyborgs). Killy seeks the net terminal genes, or an individual who has them, in order to restore ballance to the city. He thus faces the perils of the megastructure armed with a superhuman constitution and a small pistol that punches holes two feet in diameter through whatever it hits.What really sets BLAME! aside from many other manga is the unusual art style. Though it still contains the general feel of most Japanese comics the characters never seem to focus their eyes, which can be hard to get used to but adds to the lonely, hopeless atmosphere of the story. The also has a rather messy style, which may appeal to some but not to others. The factor that elevates the artwork though are the environments. From great bridges to monolithic towers the backdrops are truly masterpieces in their own right. The detail and depth is simply unmatched.Unfortunately, the series suffers from a slow start, and thus the first volume is not up to par with the rest of the story. The artwork is still in its early stages, and visually improves as the series progresses. There are no monumental plot shifts in the story either. It's really more of an introduction. The story and artwork also appeals to only a limited audience, due to a story that requires a lot of thinking to fully understand (though perhaps not in this volume). Still, if you're looking for something unique with an art style that stands out and a story to match, BLAME! offers something that breaks away from the conventional."},{"Title":"Blame!

And,3) the originality,Blame! is a journey story at it's core. It's the story of Killy's quest to find a carrier of \\"net genes,\\" but it carries a much greater depth than that.

The monolithic subterranean cityscape that serves as a backdrop for the story inspires a pervading sense of oppressive grandeur and silent malignancy. Likewise, the bizarrely jabbering and deformed monstosities that haunt the depths of its concrete labyrinths are truly the stuff of nightmares. The sheer scale of the city dwarfs the few humans to no more than crumbs or specks.Nihei's rough and expressionistic style bleeds raw emotion onto the page with savage scratchings and spatterings of ink, bringing to mind Piranesi and the etchings of Rembrandt. The storytelling is exceptional - novel camera angles heighten the drama and quick, sharp action sequences punctuate extended intervals of isolation. All in all Blame is a thoroughly entertaining and horrific read."},{"Title":"Blame! Vol. 1","review":"Great manga, definitely going to get the rest of the series soon.

Vol. 1","review":"I have read BLAME! and its sequels and prequel a few times, and I must say that this is one of those series that stands out as a testament to an individual vision. Like many of the works of Moebius/Jean Giraud, BLAME! features a mostly silent individual, wandering across a bizarre landscape. Yes, there is a plot, but it comes second to the mood. The art is superb, and the creator of the series was originally trained as an architect, which explains the depth of character in the limitless interior spaces of BLAME!. The character designs of the cybernetic monsters and scattered human tribes is brilliant as well, calling for an epic film that would need the likes of Ridley Scott or James Cameron to do it justice.I highly recommend buying this series, since you will want to go back and reread it as you go through, as the flow of consciousness style of storytelling may leave casual readers confused.

The action is sloppy and scattered, the panel transition is disjointed and difficult to follow.There's virtually no dialogue in this volume at all, so add that to the confusion and you've got a fairly weak title.There are some interesting ideas in this series though, a world consisting of thousands of levels of metal corridors and chasms being the coolest of which.Worth a look, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Blame! Vol. 1","review":"Well volume one has almost no dialogue so it is mainly just a picture book and can be read in 20-25 minutes. The dark style of the art work just makes it plain dificult to see what is going on during the action sequences. Most of the backgrounds and characters look identical.I have read several more volumes inside of the bookstores because they are such quick reads, hoping the story and art would make a rebound but no such luck.I dont feel like this story was thought out, rather just created on the spot and the art work in my opinion is not pleasurable.If your looking for a good technology story, excelent art work and pleanty of action give Eden Its and Endless world a try."},{"Title":"Entertainment Book 2006: Save Up to 50% on Things You Do Every Day!

Not only is it up-to-date and thorough but it blends a current knowledge of the Spanish wine industry with insights into Spain's history and culture. Robert Parker (aka God), the world's leading wine critic, has said of Spanish wine that,\\"Spain has done an outstanding job of maintaining respect for its traditions of the past and also looking forward to the future.\\" This wine revolution is perfectly captured in Murdock's book.However, this is not just a (well above) average reference book on Spanish wine regions and their wines. This book is far more. It is a personal journey, literally, among the highways and byways- most Spanish wineries are on byways- where the author talks to a wide cross-section of individuals involved in wine-making. This allows the reader to hear the voices of those actually making the wide variety of quality wines which Spain is now producing.In this personal account the author's acute perceptions, deep knowledge, wit and sheer passiopn of and for Spanish wines burns through. At the end of this excellent read Murdock modestly states that he is no 'expert' but '...after a helluvah lot of work, I also should know what I am talking about.' Indeed he does.As a wine merchant based in Spain and having visited many of the same places and tasted the same wines as the author I can bear witness to its accuracy and insight. This first-class book will appeal not only to all those who wish to explore Spanish wines but also ita charming people and rich culture."},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"you emerge from a reading whether chapter or the entirety full of information, history and amusemnt with which the author embues his peregrinations through spain to record the wine situation. and, oh yes, very particalized descritions are givenabout each area's wines for one's practical information. having been to the country twice it made me long to board iberia air lines for a prompt return. at very least, to start exploring the local wine shops,usa, and experimenting with some real kind of informed knowledge."},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"When I see this book, I thought \\"OK, a modern guide for spanish wines, I'll get it\\".

Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"As someone who's trying to learn more about the \\"wine culture\\" after years of clueless intrigue, I finally found the perfect source. While it primarily discusses wines from a lesser known country/producer(Spain), this book provides a firm backbone that's easily translatable across wine regions around the world. Not sure what to expect when I started, I was quickly taken by the extreme detail discussing individual wines and vineyards, and how they vary from region to region. As much as I learned about various \\"reds\\" and \\"whites\\", I received an equally thorough education on the history of each region. Humor and a lighter tone throughout make this a fun, interesting, and very informative read."},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"Let's Open a Bottle is a casual travelogue of sorts that covers all major regions of Spain, exploring the winemaking and social life of each region. It is ostensibly a guide to Spain's wine regions, but as the author, Brian Murdock states several times, he went into this not knowing much at all about the topic. He learned as he went. While at times this is charming, it also makes the book a bit difficult to read.Normally I read through books at a prodigious rate. I get hooked into them and, with books like Harry Potter or the Da Vinci Code, finish them in an evening. I really have an interest in Spanish wines - I took Spanish in school for 6 years straight and my father spent some of his childhood in Brazil. So this was a book I was keen to read through and learn from. But for whatever reason, I kept getting slowed down by the writing and would put the book down. I'd pick it up again a few days later, eager to get back into it, and the same thing would happen. In the end it took me quite a while to get through the entire book. And what did I learn? Right now I am not looking at my notes at all, and I remember -* Roads to beaches get very congested during vacation time* Various relatives and kids can be alternately cranky or helpful on wine trips* One winery was down a long, dangerous road* One winemaker stood in his vineyards, completely happy to be doing what he was doingUsually I'm far better at actually retaining content from books I read - so I think you can see the point here. What's funny is that at the end of the book Brian even offers a little quiz to see what you remembered - and he expects that you have forgotten everything. Well, everything except a bit he had just mentioned about a boar. But that's not how a well written book should be! Sure, you shouldn't have all of the wine regions memorized, or know exactly what comes from here. But because of the \\"then we went here and my kids were crying, and then we went there and the winery wasn't even open\\", the valuable information gets lost in there with everything else.That's not to say that there is NOT valuable information in here. I took many pages of notes while I read the book, and I did have some nice information by the time I was done. But that could have been done up front, for us. There's no overall map of Spain and its wine regions. The table of contents just lists the names of the chapters. You get an intro, a few myths, a quick history and then you leap into \\"Aragon\\". Now you get a map of the Aragon region, but again, the information is given in a storytelling fashion, so you never really get a good overall sense of what the region's basic output is all about. In fact, in this section the author tells how he bashes friends from giving him a wine from a sub-region here, because he'd never heard of it before. I'm not sure if that is a great attitude for a wine writer to have - to pick on a region's offerings before even tasting it!Then we move province by province across the country - or maybe around in a spiral - I'm really not sure how the given order was chosen. Sometimes you get summaries at the end of an area of what to see and do there, so it feels like a travel book. At other times it's about a specific winery. Sometimes it's mostly a rambling about what happened along the way. It's amusing because obviously the trips were not taken in the order the book is now set - sometimes there is one child, sometimes there are two.I struggle to put a finger on just why I had a problem with the book. Maybe it was the whole way in which the writer went about describing his exploits, as he talks with chum Jose about being \\"raped by a tavern keeper's lusty and lonely daughter\\" - the \\"ones with big breasts\\". On the other hand there is the page-long complaint against Levante turning a lovely beachfront into a concrete jungle. I didn't make notes on either of those - I just now flipped randomly through the pages and stopped to see what I found. There's a lot of non-wine verbiage to weed through to get to the nuggets of information. And with how the book is laid out, it's hard to make use of the information unless you compile your own notes.My suggestions? Start with an overall map. Have a table of contents that briefly describes each region, and keys it to that map, so you can go to the section you want. Have an intro that clearly defines the region's wines, the major wineries there. THEN go into a travelogue if you want, to talk about your fun experiences. But even so, I just don't think that the writer's writing style happens to match up with what I like to read. Again, I really love travelogues. They are some of my favorite types of reading material. But this just wasn't something I connected well with.So how to summarize? Keep a notebook handy. Get a bottle of Spanish wine and a block of cheese. Get your own map of Spain's wine regions and lay it out as a reference. Then start in on the book. Who knows, this style may captivate you and you may read it end to end! But if not, just do a chapter a sitting. Get a bunch of knowledge on each region, and summarize it for yourself. What makes this ironic is that the writer is a teacher. In any case, when you finish, you'll have more information about Spain than you began with, and know far more about Brian's family, friends, and secret desires for plump serving wenches than you ever cared to learn!"},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"Brian Murdock style of writing is very unusual. He handles a very boring subject in a fascinating way. This book is very easy reading, down to earth, very informative and quite enjoyable. He places the reader in the middle of the story, and you walk the sites, visit the regions and taste the wines with him. I liked Lets Open a Bottle so much that I ordered his second book when I was halfway reading this one."},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"\\"Let's Open a Bottle\\" is an excellent book on the Spanish wine scene. It is also a lot more than just about wine as the stories of the authur's journey through the Spanish wine countries are a lot of fun and insightful. He covers a lot of grounds including the local culture and the ambiance. Sometimes you wish he would go deeper into the many side trips he takes. Many will leave you wanting more. The wine aspect of this book is also excellent, thorough and informative. It offers excellent depth of coverage of each wine region, their characteristics, basic facts and informed opinions. There are a few minor regrets. The type font is very small and makes it a bit difficult to read. There is really no excuse for that. There are also no pictures. Some would have been nice. Lastly, this book is almost five years old. With the innovations and changes in the Spanish wine scene, this book is already beginning to be outdated. More about food would have been nice too. That aside, this book is far more readable than the more updated Spanish wine book \\"New Spain\\" and a lot more fun."},{"Title":"Let's Open a Bottle: My Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution","review":"This is a great read and should not be simply thought of as another boring guide to wine. The author weaves plenty of humor and history into this aptly named \\"Journey Through the Spanish Wine Revolution\\".

The end result is not only do I seek out Spanish wines in restaurants and stores, but I also want to travel to Spain to check out the various regions and their unique cultures and geographies. I should also note that I have given this book as a gift to a few people who have loved it as well."},{"Title":"Decorative Concrete (Sunset)","review":"Not enough how-to in this book for me.

This book describes the challenges of photographing these houses, both in Black and White and colour. Photos that you take for granted have a lot more art and skill involved in producing them than is readily apparent - especially if you haven't tried to take these sort of photos yourself. ( I have, and they never look as good as what you see in this book)This is a wonderful book and covers 25 houses. The photos are a mixture of black and white and colour. All pictures are beautiful and sharp and printed on high quality glossy art paper. The houses range from Castello di Guarene in Piedmont, Palazzo Albrizzi in Venice, Schloss Bruhl in Cologne, Chateau de Bussy-Rabutin in Burgundy, Hotel de Lauzun in Paris and Skoloster in Sweden as just an example of a few.Some of the houses/castles covered in this book only have a few photos, while others are up to 4 or 5 pages long. Sometimes you wish for colour pictures, but not all these photos were originally taken with colour film, and even when printed in black and white all these pictures are of excellent quality. The text for each house gives you some of the background history of it, but unfortunately doesn't tell you if the house is open to the public today - or even still intact with its contents (some of these photos are decades old)Country Life magazine today continues its regular articles on the Country Houses of both the UK and Europe, and it is lovely to see the best of their archives being printed in these books. The great Country Houses of Europe are one of the great wonders of the world and usually represent some to the best of preserved artistic endeavour over the centuries if you take your time to search them out. This book stands out from the crowd for the unusual range of houses covered and as a snapshot of some of the more outstanding examples."},{"Title":"Tasha Tudor's Fairy Tales","review":"This book was given to me as a gift when I was a small child in the 1960's.

Bender, author of Until There Was Us and Rising Up"},{"Title":"The Birth of African-American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective","review":"'The Birth of African-American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective' is an early 1970s reaction to the \`swift' establishment of Afro-American and Black Studies programmes within the U.S. American Universities, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement. Its authors-Sidney Mintz and Richard Price-feared that, with the \`explosion' of general interest in Black History, ideological concerns might sidetrack the invaluable \`scholarly quest' previously established by the likes of W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston (in the U.S.A.) Jean Price-Mars (in Haiti) or Fernando Ortiz (in Cuba) to name a few. Therefore, 'The Birth of African-American Culture' cautiously offers strategies/approaches to study the Afro-American past that would do justice to the complexity of the subject. Its central thesis, supported both by documentary material and speculation, is straightforward: continuities between the so-called \`Old' and \`New' Worlds must be established on a comprehension of the \`basic conditions' under which the migrations of \`enslaved Africans' took place.Today, that the analysis of the development of Afro-American culture should focus on \`process' is no longer an issue; the works of renowned scholars such as Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Lawrence W. Levine are a testimony to it. In a sense, these academics vindicate Mintz and Price who, two decades earlier, have emphasised the need for more analytical subtlety, flexibility, and sound socio-historical research in Afro-American Studies. What is more, Mintz and Price are aware of the book's achievement, even though, in its 1992 re-edition, caution is still strong in the way they reassert their belief in a two decade-old thesis. For example, in the new preface, Mintz and Price repeat that the unavoidable fact in the study of Afro-America is \`the humanity of the oppressed, and the inhumanity of the systems that oppressed them.' Both believe that such oppression \`has by no means ended should be clear to everyone, as it is to us.'The text of 'The Birth of African-American Culture', including introduction and conclusion, is eighty-five pages long; yet amazingly it covers a broad range of complex issues focused on slave society, from the origins and beginnings of Afro-American societies and cultures to questions of kinship and sex roles therein. In their rigorously balanced, albeit too tentative at times, analysis of Afro-American Culture the authors rightfully argue that the transfer of culture intact from Africa to the Americas is more fiction than reality. Mintz and Price believe that \`Retentions' and \`Survivals' are more the exception than the rule in any group's transport of beliefs and values from one locale to another (Europeans included).The Birth of African-American Culture is thought provoking; it is still very useful in the scholarship on slavery, and issues of the origins and development of Afro-American culture. It is also a must-read for those Africans who refuse to be carelessly melted in the pot of global Blackness. Because of never-ending and multifaceted oppression, contemporary Africans and Afro-Americans still need to negotiate an awful number of complex issues before being \`brothers' and \`sisters': it has been so for centuries despite the numerous bonds that (do) exist between members of the Black Diaspora. Like Mintz and Price, it is my profound conviction that \`the nature of oppression, while obvious in its most familiar forms, involves subtleties as well, one of these being the way it divides and confuses honest [souls] by perpetuating suspicion and fear.' However, in its future editions, 'The Birth of African-American Culture''s authors need to:(1) Go beyond offering startegies/approaches to the study of the Afro-American past, and present results of such studies, albeit selectively, if only to corroborate and strengthen their own thesis/be bolder in their arguments. I believe that Mintz and Price missed this opportunity two decades after the first publication of their book but, still, it can be done;(2) Spend time to explain to the reader how \`Caribbeanist' scholars like themselves can write about (Afro-) \`American' culture. In other words the intertwined issues of what \`America' is, what \`Americans' are and how they relate to the subject matter of 'The Birth of African-American Culture' must be tackled in much detail and clarity."},{"Title":"The Birth of African-American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective","review":"Even though I am versed in the topic, I am not a social scientist.

From the outset, the book shows many examples which the authors touts as the best way to learn something. However, many of the examples used have little or no explanation of some of the cryptic commands contained within. You end up wasting a lot of time scratching your head trying to find out *what* is going on. It becomes a matter of wading through the entire book since many terms are not even listed in the index. A glossary and perhaps a command reference would have been extremely useful in this book."},{"Title":"PostScript(R) by Example","review":"PostScript by Example may be your best introduction to this somewhat obscure page description language. I credit McGilton and Campione for providing what little I understand of PostScript object and stack creation and manipulation. Everything you need to know about basic syntax, construction of Bezier paths, use of fonts, graphic transformation and use of dictionaries is here, and it's properly commented, too!If you absolutely HAVE to code or troubleshoot in PostScript and are wading through Adobe's Red Book (PostScript Language Reference Manual, 2nd Edition) or Blue Book (PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook), then take a break, accelerate yourself and read PostScript by Example.Unfortunately, through no fault of the authors, some of what they have built is not really useable. The information in chapter ten on creating a user-defined (Type 3) font has no bearing in any PostScript interpreter environment I can access. This includes, Illustrator 6 and 7, Tailor 2 and Acrobat Distiller 3.0.2. If I'm doing something wrong, I'd like to see where, but in point of fact the Type 3 font information in the Red Book doesn't work either in those environments.This, as I have mentioned, is not the fault of the writers, who cannot be held accountable for changes in the software since 1993. It would, however, be nice to see an update to this book, especially inasmuch as PostScript is now upgrading to level 3.

Most of us will relate to the hardware and rigging illustrated in the photos because most of us are still sailing boats exactly like these. Though written for a British audience it deals with typically European sailing problems in a universal fashion; the discussion of docking or mooring in tidal surge areas, a necessary tedium found in most British books, was general enough to be useful for sailors in, say, Atlantic Canada. Each chapter focuses on how a couple or family would split duties and what each crew member should do as other operations take place, a unique format that makes this older book a must for the bookshelf of the family skipper struggling to sort out the process of sailing with crew."},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire","review":"I found this book to be lacking in details for the advanced shooter who is looking for information on individual rifles and pistols .the author did not go into much detail ,this book would be ok for a beginner who knows nothing about firearms.It was not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire","review":"I am an avid .22 rimfire fan. I've bought books on the .22 rimfire years ago and have been waiting for something more current. Good book covering some of the .22's out there and ammo testing along with info on the new .17HMR and .17M2 calibers. The author repeated himself over and over across several chapters the same information. A lot of the photos were reprinted across several chapters. This book could have been about half the size if the author had not repeated information throughout the book. Most of the guns covered in the book were from the author's own collection and did not really cover the various manufacturers offerings. Several good chapters on sighting in and ammo ballistics but overall I was disappointed in this book. If you are looking for a \\"little new\\" information on the .22 rimfire there is some here. If you are looking for more in depth information you will have to wait until someone else comes along and writes a better book."},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire","review":"This book has almost the same title as one written by John Lachuk and published in 1978. Since I consider John Lachuk's book to be the best written on this subject, it makes for a good reference and source to compare to. In my opinion James House has done a very good job writing this book. It is sort of an updated version of the 1978 book. Very informative with lots of information on past and current 22's with test firing results. There isn't an area that James House doesn't touch on. Even though he has written other articles and books on weapons, I did not know of Mr. House before this book. Don't let that fool you. This book is well researched, well thought out, well laid out and well written. It might not overtake John Lachuk's book as the best on the subject, but I'd hate to have to live on the difference. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire","review":"For background, I am a rifleman of sorts as well as a ballistician.I also have a Ph. D. James E. House has a Ph. D in Chemistry and his extensive technical background is evident all through this work. This book is encyclopedic in scope and I have found no significant errors in it. I would observe that he does not discuss nor explicate ballistics tables from which ballistic coefficients are derived. I would have preferred that at least some of his more accurate rifles were tested using ten round groups at 50 yards but his use of five round groups is reasonable (multiply five round group size by 1.414 to estimate ten round group size.) I also wish he had devoted (more) attention to rimfire bench rest competition. This may be a bit more detail than the beginner will wish but for anyone with a serious interest in rimfire cartridges and shooting, this book is a must-have.

What an education in basics of ammunition in general and the .22 LR Rimfire and its like (.22 WMR, .17 HMR, etc). You learn WHY a rifle has to account for sights 1.5 inches above the muzzle center and so much more.The author's experiences and recommendations are just like sitting down with your Uncle who was a former instructor in the Marines... For the uneducated, this book will help you look at ammunition effectively, and guns - various rifles and pistols - with new found understanding.

It begins with. &quot;Are you a real greenhorn?,&quot; moves to a web-speak glossary (including chatroom shorthand) and wraps up with a suggestion to surf the web to study good design (not bad advice, excepting there's just so much bad design to make this a blanket tip).Of course in between these, the authors do indicate how to use the application, giving accurate descriptions of how to use each function in a relatively simple way.So again, a good book with the caveat that it is a beginner's title, not for intermediate or advanced web authors who are adding Livemotion to their tool box and want to get into the more complex aspects of this tool."},{"Title":"LiveMotion for Windows & Macintosh (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"If you're already familiar with photoshop, illustrator, and have some familiarity of flash or vector animation, this book will only have limited usage.

Anyone who purchases this, or any other History textbook will want to check the information presented against Historical documents to get the most accurate information available. I can recommend 'Pilgrims Plantation' which is actual documents recorded by the Separatists for a start, and letters from John and Abigail Adams to each other. This History book did align rather well with those. One reviewer left a rather angry review of this book, and I can understand. No one likes books that are biased.

It's highly biased to the point of containing inaccurate information, and the content/topics the author chose to include (or chose not to include) is questionable as well. It's as if the author wrote it from memory during a creative streak but couldn't be bothered to check her sources. I used to be a big fan of those novel-like biographies for kids, which is what this book is reminiscent of, but calling this a history textbook is a whole 'nother story.

But the rewards are big -- Popper comes close to defining the method of the field I would call &quot;societal engineering&quot;.Popper's main points to me are:1. You can't plan and carry out a reform of the whole society. Reason - the people who carry out reforms are themselves changed by reforms. They loose relative objectivity and can no longer see clearly the original plan of reform and follow it.2. You can plan and carry out changes in a relatively small sector or in a narrow field. Reason - it's possible to receive objective feedback and act on it to steer the reform into the objectives of the original plan.Examples from Soviet history that startled me:1. A failure of Lenin and Bolsheviks to change society. They created a plan and did they try -- but the resulting system (in which I was born) instead of changing according to plan, just fed them the data their plans required. Even more almost all the originators of changes were destroyed by these changes.2. A relative success of the NEP (New Economic Politics) initiated by Lenin and his associates. It dealt with relatively narrow field - small to middle businesses and it had definite goal -- to feed hungry country of the post-World War I Soviet Russia. And it did succeed! The NEP was stopped by Stalin, who unsuccessfully continued to implement plans to change whole society."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism","review":"Karl Popper is one of the best thinkers about philosophy and Political theory.Two of his greatest merits are, in order: The first is his coherent life (congruence between thougths and acts) and the other is that when this book came up first (it took about 18 years to be translated from German to English), the historycal timing (1950's) was the worst: Everybody thought that the Marxist theory regarding the history was right and scientifically proven.Sir Popper demonstrated all errors of the Marxism from the ideolodical point of view, and that's why the name of the book.Also, Mr. Popper was the only deep critiziser of Karl Marx."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism","review":"I read this book, and several of Karl Popper's other books then available in English, while still a graduate student in anthropology at an American university. While neither my dissertation committee members nor even my fellow graduate students were much interested in my attempts to bring Popper's arguments to their attention, I found his work to be exhilarating for its clarity, courage, and fairmindedness. Thirty-plus years later, I still do."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism","review":"Karl Popper (1902-1994) was an Austro-British philosopher and a professor at the London School of Economics, and one of the greatest philosophers of science of the 20th century. He notes in the \\"Historical Note\\" that begins this 1936 book, \\"The fundamental thesis of this book... [is] that the belief in historical destiny is sheer superstition, and that there can be no prediction of the course of human history by scientific or any other methods.\\" (Pg. v) He adds, \\"for strictly logical reasons, it is impossible for us to predict the future course of history.\\" (Pg. vi)He summarizes his argument: \\"(1) The course of human history is strongly influenced by the growth of human knowledge... (2) We cannot predict, by rational or scientific methods, the future growth of our scientific knowledge... (3) We cannot, therefore, predict the future course of human history. (4) This means that we must reject the possibility of a theoretical history...\\" (Pg. vi-vii) He defines \\"historicism\\" as \\"an approach to the social sciences which assumes that historical prediction is their principal aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns,' the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history.\\" (Pg. 3)He argues, \\"We have therefore no valid reason to expect of any apparent repetition of a historical development that it will continue to run parallel to its prototype. Admittedly, once we believe in a law of repetitive life-cycles... we are sure to discover historical confirmation of it nearly everywhere. But this is merely one of the many instances of metaphysical theories seemingly confirmed by facts---facts which, if examined more closely, turn out to be selected in the light of the very theories they are supposed to test.\\" (Pg. 111)He asserts that \\"The thesis of the unity of scientific method... can be extended... even to the field of the historical sciences... It is the distinction between the interest in universal laws and the interest in particular facts... history is characterized by its interest in actual, singular, or specific events, rather than in laws or generalizations.\\" (Pg. 143)He ultimately concludes, \\"[we should] write that history which interests us... we need not worry about all those facts and aspects which have no bearing upon our point of view and which therefore do not interest us. Such selective approaches fulfill functions in the study of history which are in some ways analogous to those of theories in science.\\" (Pg.150-151)Popper's book is one of the key documents in the modern philosophy of history."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism","review":"This classic little work is a must read for any theorist of history and evolution, which is not to say that one agrees altogether with Popper's formulation. Reflecting Popper's experience both with issues of scientific methodology and the ideologies of scientism, the work ends in a paradoxical mode with respect to the idea of a science of history and/or evolution. The invisible influence of the antinomies of Kantian critical thought buttress the basic argument, as it transforms the term 'historicism' itself from its nineteenth century usage into something different, in a confusion of terminology that does not invalidate the basic thrust. Popper's insight remains fundamental even if the implied usage directed at more rigid forms of Marxism narrows its scope. We live in an age that has reinvented the fallacy of (Popperian)historicism in the search for causal social theories of all types, and the results are always in the same difficulty that Popper points to. If a deterministic theory bent on predicting the future fails for the reasons Popper gives,the implication that there can be no genuine 'universal history' fails as a necessary consequence. For such a history might embrace rather than be contradicted by Popper's argument, leaving us to wonder if there is not also a certain poverty to 'anti-historicism' in the sense of throwing out the baby with the bath, i.e. finding history to be without meaning! In any case, a classic little work. The section on the &quot;Oedipus Effect&quot; invokes the tragic theme, with Popper as a sort of theoretical Tiresias, grizzled and omimous.

By reading what sell-side analysts have to say, what data services and newspapers provide, and looking at technical charts, they buy and sell securities. In Off the Record, you will learn how to move out of Wall Street to look at competitors, the marketplace served by companies, their managements, and unusual factors to locate the best stocks to buy and sell.This book is based on the experiences of Craig Gordon in doing similar analysis for his firm, OTA/Off the Record Research. The purpose is &quot;to give you -- the individual investor -- the skills to differentiate between whare are irrelevant and what are important, unique observations to help you buy or sell stocks.&quot; To do this, the book helps &quot;you structure questions that confirm or dispute your investment thesis, to find useful sources to talk to, and to quickly interpret the information you gather.&quot; The drawback is that the process does &quot;take a lot of effort.&quot; As a result, you are encouraged to pursue this process with other people, possibly including the members of an investment club.The suggestions are solid. The details are helpful. You can make this work. Most institutional investors aren't paying attention to these factors, especially on smaller capitalization companies.Let's be realistic though. Unless you really like doing this kind of detailed research, it will never happen. You will start, and soon slough off. That can be dangerous if you stop paying attention and a stock weakens. Since Mr. Gordon recommends that you take a concentrated position in a few stocks, you could get hurt in the process. Even if you keep it up, you may not be a very good analyst.If you are an average investor, this is probably not a good program for you. The book should have put this concept into more of a context. It would be all right for a very small portion of your money, until you get a sense of how good you are at it over a number of years. Most people won't be very effective. For those people, I still recommend a bundle of low-cost indexed mutual funds. I graded the book down one star for this weakness.On the other hand, if you always wanted to know more about how to follow Peter Lynch's advice and invest intelligently in what you know, this book will take you much further than you would have made it on your own. I do suggest that you use these methods to supplement whatever you do that has worked well for you over many years, rather than to use the book to totally replace your current methods. Keep in mind that a great company may be a lousy stock investment.I completely agree with Mr. Gordon that the &quot;research&quot; coming out of Wall Street brokerage firms is weaker and more suspect than it has been in many years. Be careful!After you finish reading this well-constructed set of thoughtful instructions, I suggest you think about where else people tend to leap in before looking hard enough. How could couples thinking about marriage better assess their future prospects together? How can you learn if a new diet will help your health without trying it? How can you make better decisions about what movies to see?Learn to construct questions and seek sources to help you anticipate what will happen . . . it beats the school of hard knocks by a wide margin!"},{"Title":"Off the Record: What Wall Street Doesn't Want You to Know","review":"Craig Gordon's Off The Record presents the investor's secrets for discovering great stocks which are underrated or misunderstood by the majority of Wall Street investors. Most don't know how to thoroughly research such stocks and by the time knowledge becomes public, it's too late to profit. This provides many practical keys to such initial analysis."},{"Title":"Off the Record: What Wall Street Doesn't Want You to Know","review":"In Off the Record..., Gordon goes well beyond Peter Lynch in helping the average investor get a leg up in the equity markets. He not only explains why &quot;marketplace checking&quot;--the concept on which he has built his own business--is so important, but gives the average investor the basic tools to put it into practice. The fresh and insightful chapter on why diversification makes little sense for the non-institutional investor alone is worth the price of the book.

Too bad there's not a good version on Kindle."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"Spanish Verbs is the shorter version of the Barron's 501 Verbs series. This pocket-sized book makes it easy for students to mobilize their Spanish learning experience. Students who study this book are exposed to 301 of the most commonly used Spanish verbs, and each page of the book contains a verb. Each verb is organized with the infinitive, gerund, and past participle occupying the top of the page. Just below this section is the category under which this verb falls. These categories include ar, er, or ir verbs. After the verb category segment, there are two columns for the seven simple tenses and the seven compound tenses.Besides the 301 alphabetized verb listing, which is the main component of the text, students have the opportunity to explore topics such as the formation of the present and past participles in Spanish, principal parts of some important Spanish verbs, sample English verb conjugation, a summary of meanings and uses of Spanish verb tenses and moods as related to English verb tenses and moods, subject pronouns, the Spanish alphabet and the new system of alphabetizing, an index of English-Spanish verbs and common irregular Spanish verb forms identified by infinitive, and over 1,000 Spanish verbs conjugated like model verbs.Whether you're a beginner, intermediate or advanced level student it is important to spend time building your grammar and vocabulary skills, as these are essential commodities for your Spanish language journey. In addition, students who love to study on the go have the added benefit of the book's lightweight nature.Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Rosetta Stone Spanish.Rosetta Stone Spanish (Latin America) Level 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companion. Rather expensive but excellent for the visual learner like myself and great for a person who has never studied any Spanish before. In order to speak Spanish fluently, you must also learn lots of new words.A resource that highly recommend for adding new words to your Spanish vocabulary isQuick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cardsIt is a tremendous bargain for the price since you get 1,000 of these cards.For learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs, the best product is theVerbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)software.

And, of course, the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. It is one of the best investments you can make in your learning-Spanish studies. Another feature that I like about this interactive software is that it really helped improve my pronunciation.The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish isThe Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series).

As I said, this book contains 1,000 such references.Barron's Spanish verbs contains other useful indices as well, such as the very handy \\"Index of common irregular spanish verb forms identified by infinitive.\\" This is very handy for confusing, stem-changing (radical-changing) verbs.Also included is an English-to-Spanish verb dictionary, which can stand in for a general Spanish dictionary, since Spanish verbs can so readily morph into nouns.I find this book very useful, along with \\"Oxford Spanish Verbs\\" AKA \\"Oxford Spanish Verbpack.\\" That book has 4,000 verbs, consisting of 92 verbs fully conjugated, plus the list of reference verbs.You can buy both books without breaking the bank."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"I can tell you from a brutal 18 years of experience as a Spanish student, 99% of the challenge in speaking Spanish is learning to deal with the verb conjugations. You will get absolutely nowhere until you get some rudimentary ability with that. You must learn to relate the conjugated verb that you hear to its infinitive. Thus if you hear \\"corremos,\\" you need to recognize that that is a form of the verb \\"correr,\\" which means \\"to run.\\" It's not easy and the problem is made soo annoyingly worse by the fact that you will not find the conjugated verb forms in any Spanish dictionary. Thus if you are reading a book and you want to look up \\"corro\\" (I run), you will find no such word in the dictionary...you will only find \\"correr,\\" but if you don't understand that \\"corro\\" is a form of \\"correr,\\" then you are totally hosed. 501 Spanish Verbs by Christopher Kendris is largely a valuable dictionary of verbs along with their conjugated forms (something you will not find elsewhere), but the real jewel of the book is a 30 page primer on Spanish grammar. 30 pages is much easier to read and digest than some 500 page Spanish textbook, but also probably gives you 100% of what you will ever need to know...in only 30 pages. I spoke and listened to Spanish every day for a solid year without making much progress. Then someone loaned me this book and I made great progress after that.One correction to the book: Gustar is a problem for English speaking students of Spanish because it's used backwards of the way we phrase the corresponding concept in English. This book has a poor handling of this word and I can suggest something more useful. \\"Gustar\\" is often defined as \\"to like\\" as in \\"to like something\\" as in \\"I like you\\" or \\"I like food.\\" That's not a good definition because the verb is not conjugated that way. For example, if you think of \\"gustar\\" as \\"to like,\\" the sentence \\"I like you,\\" would be something like \\"Me gusto a ti,\\" attempting to conjugate \\"gustar\\" to \\"I like\\" as \\"gusto.\\" But that actually means something close to \\"you like me,\\" the opposite of what was intended. The actual sentence would be \\"Me gustas.\\" Again if you think of \\"gustar\\" as \\"to like,\\" \\"gustas\\" would seem to mean \\"you like\\" and the example sentence would seem to mean \\"you like me,\\" again the opposite of what it actually means. All of that is so confusing, but the confusion is somewhat needless.Instead, \\"gustar\\" should be thought of as \\"to please\\" and the student needs to learn to phrase the English concept this way before translating to Spanish. Thus the common phrase \\"I like you\\" needs to be phrased as \\"you please me,\\" leading more easily to the correct conjugation of \\"gustas\\" meaning \\"you please.\\" 501 Spanish verbs does mention \\"to please\\" in the defintion, but it also defines it as \\"to like\\" and that leads to confusion. Moreover, the conjugations listed for this verb are not complete and thus many needed conjugations are ignored. For example, \\"gustas\\" is not listed, along with many more. Unfortunately I can not list here the 50 needed conjugations...you're on your own for that!"},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"I'm a Spanish teacher and this book is wonderful for me and students who want to increase their conjugation skills."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"This is a excellent guide for students, teachers, professionals, business travelers, and anybody wanting to speak and write correctly in Spanish. The book presents 301 verbs in all their tenses, including present, past, future, conditional, etc. That's a total of 14 different forms/tenses - don't worry, you only need know a couple tenses to communicate effectively. Their book also provides explanations for each tense, along with some nice verb/sentence examples in both English and Spanish. Additionally, this guide is compact enough (6 X 4 inches, 1 inch thick) to fit easily into purses and most pockets. I've relied on this book both here and while traveling, studying, and working in Latin America; it's a practical, compact, excellent value."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"This is an essential book for students of Spanish language.

Five stars for high school. However, the book only covers the basics, so one needs a much more extensive book if one has a strong, continuing interest in the language."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"Spanish verbs is a great book for beginning and even intermediate Spanish learners. At the beginning, there is a thorough overview of the uses of all of the Spanish tenses. After that, there are hundreds of fully conjugated verbs with general definitions and examples of each verb. This is especially useful with irregular verbs. Spanish Verbs not only delivers the information on each tense but also gives conjugated examples of some very useful verbs. I highly recommend this book to the beginning and intermediate Spanish learner because it clearly states the uses and delivers the conjugations in a standard, organized order. Plus, all verbs are in alphabetical order so no hassle. Be sure to purchase this book; it will enhance your Spanish whether you are looking for an introduction to Spanish, a review of the verbs and verb forms, or simply as a reference to be used as needed."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"I am ordering this book because I saw someone using it on the subway yesterday!

I personally didn't rate it higher because there are a number of key verbs that are not listed that i personally needed. I speak spanish at a very high level, but i am not fluent yet. But anyone who speaks or is learning to speak spanish knows that the verbs are everything, and i was hoping to shore up my spanish with learning all the tenses of verbs which i hear people use when they talk to me in everyday conversation that i didn't have a firm grasp of. That's where i was hoping that this book would fill in my final missing pieces, to which it does to some degree because there are lots of the important verbs there,and listed in all tenses which is great.

I carry mine just about everywhere as a quick reference tool.I'm very impressed with this book as well as other material from Barron's. The verbs included in this book were well chosen, the layout is pleasing and organized, and there is an index in the back of the book that lists all the verbs in English alphabetical order, which makes everything easy to find. There's also an index of 1000 additional verbs that are cross referenced by conjugation to the original 300.Students at any level will get a lot of use out of this guide.

There are other Spanish verb books, but they're much larger and not very portable.Brandon Simpson"},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"Please note that this is for the second edition of this book, copyright 2001. The previous edition says copyright 1990. I can't tell from the Amazon book page here if this is the first edition or second edition, but the cover design is slightly different from that displayed here from my copy, which I recently purchased, so I mention that just in case.No matter what language you're learning (unless its Turkish, which has 100% regular verbs, or Japanese, which has only two), verbs are usually a major difficulty and stumbling block in learning a foreign language. This is the best compact verb book I've seen for Spanish. The pages VII to XL (7 to 40) in the introduction contain the best capsule grammar of verbs for Spanish I've seen, and is better than the ones I've seen in some of the bigger, beefier grammar books for quickly getting a good grasp of the basics as well as the more complex issues.There are many features I like about this book, but one especially helpful thing the author does is to explain the formal grammatical names for the verb tenses, aspects, and moods and how they are formed in English, along with plenty of examples. For example, many of us have never thought of what the preterit or pluperfect is in English, but Kendris explains this along with many other useful things. Another nice feature is his discussion of how some verbs that express a mental state actually change meaning in the preterit. For example, the sentence, \\"Supe la verdad,\\" means \\"I found out the truth.\\" (Saber, which means to know, changes from \\"know\\" to \\"found\\" in the preterit). And the sentence \\"Pude hacerlo,\\" means \\"I succeeded in doing it.\\" (Poder, which means \\"to be able,\\" means \\"succeeded\\" in the preterit).Other features include extensive lists and coverage of irregular verbs, an index of 1000 verbs keyed to one of the models or patterns of the 300 main verbs in the text, an index of common irregular verbs identified by the infinitive, which allows you to look up which infinitive verb form it belongs to without knowing that initially, and an index of Spanish/English verbs. Each conjugation page contains at least a few examples at the bottom of the page of usages, such as in the Kendris's larger 501 Spanish Verbs book. Overall, an excellent little verb and grammar book for the student of Spanish, and considering the price is only 6 bucks and is over 300 pages long, a great value to boot."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"My pocket dictionary by Langenscheidts, which I give 5 stars to also, has some verbs in tables which is handy. But I wanted to have a small, but fairly comprehensive pocket verb book. It turns out this is better than I could have ever imagined. In the front it shows the tenses and how, when, and why to use them. (It's the same as 501 Spanish Verbs.) What's even better is in the back it has an alphabetical listing in English of all the verbs in the book. If you need to know a verb, you can certainly find it in your pocket dictionary, but seeing it conjugated is extremely helpful whether you're a beginner or someone in an intermediate or advanced level. Most verb conjugations are easy to remember, but if you forget, you can look in this book which is so light and compact, it's incredibly easy to carry. You can't go wrong with this book even if it's the book you'd rather have than 501 Spanish Verbs."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","review":"I am learning Spanish and this book helps me a lot when I want to learn, speak, write, or translate anything from English to Spanish or Spanish to English.

There is one verb on each page with all the verb conjugations for all tenses and all persons (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, etc.). It is very clear. At the bottom of the page, there is a small collumn that has words and expressions related to the verb you are looking at. In the back, it has a small dictionary to look up the verb in English so you can find it in the book. Then, it has a small section for verbs that are not included in the book; it gives you the page number to a verb that conjugations the same way as the verb you are looking up, so even if the verb is not in the book, it gives an example of how to conjugate it. It also has a small section of alphebatically ordered tenses of irregular verbs and it gives you the page number of the verb that it comes from. Some verbs you can not immediatley tell what the infinnitive is, so this helps a lot. At the beggining of the book there is an intro explaining each verb tense and how to use it and examples so, even if you have never been taught any type of Spanish verbs, this explains it to you.Also, this a good size to carry with you.

If I purchased a book like this and brought it back to the cashier, I would probably get my money back.The tables of Verbs are too small for Kindle. I have a Kindle 3G. If you imagine a small font at size 6 or 7 for any of the standard type fonts, the contents of the table would be size 2 or 3. This is after the zoom! Whoever sold this book to Kindle should have tried it out beforehand on a real Kindle. It is like they shrunk the page by 50% from the print version. It fills up maybe only a third of the Kindle screen. With the zoom, it fills up maybe 50% of the screen - still too small, especially in low light. Changing from portrait to landscape mode on the screen doesn't help improve the size.Barron's should consider either fixing this situation or refunding the money for the Kindle version.

Ever since the Second World War, Pareto has a been a persona non grata among the chattering classes and within the reality-cloistered groves of academe. Left-wing intellectuals cannot forgive him for writing &quot;Mind and Society.&quot; Why are they so upset? Because Pareto dared to tell the truth about nature of society. Instead of concocting some sterile utopia or whining about the disadvantaged and the poor, Pareto set out to describe society as he found it. And he went about his business in a manner that was certain to offend the sensitive souls of intellectual's and left-wing idealogues everywhere. The study of society, Pareto makes clear in this treatise, is not about wishful thinking or curing the ills of humanity. No, it is about discovering uniformities in the social order, which means: discovering what makes society tick. Pareto traces the motive forces behind social change to human nature. Ruling elites tend to be one of two predominant types: they are either &quot;lions&quot; or &quot;foxes.&quot; Lions try to rule through force; foxes try to rule through chicanery. The trouble with lions is that they tend to be rigid in their views. They dislike innovation and oppose progress. The trouble with foxes is that they shrink from the use of force and are susceptible to the excesses of humanitarianism. If a nation is to have a stable ruling elite, it needs a mixture of lions and foxes. Otherwise, you have social disequilibrium and crisis.Pareto's scientific approach to sociology is refreshing in an age when everyone wants to interpret social and political issues in purely ideological terms. His prose is lively, engaging, and often very witty. His rampages against humanitarianism and ideology are hilarious. I would recommend using Amazon.com's search service to find a used copy of either the two volume or four volume versions of this work. It is well worth the trouble. Social science doesn't get any better, nor more readable, than this."},{"Title":"The Mind and Society: A Treatise on General Sociology (Complete)","review":"Just a heads up for the Kindle users, the Kindle edition only contains volume 1, 2-4 are not included.

Imagine how excited I was to hear that this would finally be available in english! The first volume really doesn't tell much, just some basic background. Laures is a demon king in love with Hilda, a dancer, but there is also someone else in love with Hilda, and that is where much of the drama comes in. This is one story that is pure fantasy which actually makes it more fun because you can just allow yourself to get lost in the fantastical. There are beautiful demons, demons that look like angels, and a man that is obviously a little crazy (but he's hot!), and not to give anything away but there is some really twisted displays of affection to come! Highly recommended because even though this first volume doesn't give away much, the story gets so much better and the art is really top-notch!

I enjoyed this romance; on the first reading, turning each page made me smile anew, mainly because of the eye candy art. Laures is so over-the-top effeminate and pretty (although he occasionally manages to look a bit like Michael Jackson, but you can judge that for yourself). You Higuri pulled out all the stops when she invented him, not bothering to make him plausible; it's fantasy fun, pure and simple. That said, the rather simplistic plotline so far doesn't give the book much re-read value but I'm waiting for the following volumes to see print in English to find out how the story continues. I've been hoping for this series to get translated ever since I began admiring You Higuri's art back in high school.

Mencken was a brilliant man, a brilliant writer, and this is a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"H. L. Mencken was born in Baltimore in 1880 and for his developmental years was a &quot;bookworm.&quot; He resolved to pursue a more active life as he grew and discovered his niche in journalism. In 1899 he went to work for the Baltimore Morning Herald and found the going difficult at first, but as he persisted he discovered that was where he was most suited and kept the title &quot;newspaperman&quot; the rest of his life. He remained in his home town and continued to live in the home his family had lived in rather than seeking career advancement in larger markets. One of the first essays in this collection is one he wrote about his hometown, &quot;The Baltimore of the Eighties.&quot; Another early one describes the local YMCA. His piece on Theodore Dreiser contains a segment on the art of communicating via the written word. A tribute to William Jennings Bryan which was published in the American Mercury in 1925 is included in this collection. Other pieces are on the people, times, circumstances, and issues of the era in which he made his observations. While I do not agree with him on many topics, his work demonstrates the efforts of a skilled writer."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"The Vintage Mencken, edited by Alistair Cooke, will have readers reaching for their dictionaries and laughing uproariously at the same time. Mencken, in savage and truculent language, denounces politicians, YMCA's,educational systems, American authors, police officers, and other manifestations of quackery. An excellent introduction to the work of the man called &quot;The Sage from Baltimore.&quot;"},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"Please read this book for a refreshing view from a highly intelligent author from the early 20th century...Mencken was *not* a confirmed racist - this tag was applied to him when some of his personal diaries were published and his writings were compared against the current day \\"PC\\" language test. If you were to strike up a conversation with any person 90 years ago I would think their speech would shock modern sensibilities on the race issue. In Menckin's case, I encourage you to read about his actions in the race issue - the fact that as an editor he published African-American authors when no other mainstream publications would do so.

In fact, this book should be a staple of American Studies curriculae.Just as it would be interesting and very helpful if we could have Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln around to advise us today, so would we be greatly entertained and enlightened (at the very least in the sense of having our spirits lifted) if Mencken were here to ply his craft from his charming little townhouse in Baltimore."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"I can't recall when I first read this--maybe 30 years ago. You just wanna write a Mencken-tinged missive to your Congressperson afterward. But Mencken could be vicious without being vengeful, something few public personae are capable of today. The piece on Valentino is incredible: the Valentino-Mencken tete-a-tete would make great theater, I think. Mencken would be really uncomfortable in today's simplified soundbyte world: here was a confirmed racist who promoted the Harlem Renaissance &amp; condemned segregation in public places. Still, his essays on Baltimore in the 1880s, Lincoln, &amp; chiropracty are the American language in shining armor. Anyone who wants to write well should read this.

The selected essays are interesting and often very funny, but I somehow expected a more comprehensive and well-rounded selection of his writings. The book is certainly entertaining and sometimes insightful - hence a purchase to be considered. However, a better job could have been done in selecting the material for the book - including perhaps a selection of his famous aphorisms."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"_The Vintage Mencken_ compiled by Mencken's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alistair Cooke is a collection of various essays of the great Baltimore iconoclast H. L. Mencken. H. L. Mencken (1880 - 1956) was a journalist and writer who was born and lived in Baltimore for most of his life. Mencken is perhaps best known as one of the founders of _The American Mercury_. Mencken's commentary on American life and politics in the early Twentieth Century is often bitter, sarcastic, cynical, and abrasive, but the intent is almost always humorous. Mencken is also well-known for being brazenly politically incorrect and has been criticized extensively for his alleged \\"racism\\" and \\"anti-Semitism\\" by the usual suspects. However, like all Mencken's opinions, his views remain highly idiosyncratic and difficult to define, and Mencken frequently rails against \\"Ku Kluxry\\", though whether he is being intentionally ironic is difficult to determine. However, while Mencken's challenge to the political correctness of his day is to be applauded, in certain respects he can become infuriating. Among other things, Mencken takes on Prohibition, religion, \\"puritanism\\", racial equality, the plutocracy, American militarism and World Wars I and II, Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt, feminism, Anglo-Saxon superiority, the South and rural people, populism, \\"quackery\\" in medicine, fundamentalism, and anti-Darwinism. Philosophically, Mencken appears to have been influenced by the caustic style of both Mark Twain and Nietzsche. Mencken's political views have been described as libertarian (and he even at times uses the very word \\"libertarian\\" to describe the general gist of his viewpoint); however, they differ in certain respects from modern libertarianism. Mencken also retains an elitist attitude, frequently looking down at rural people and the middle classes (what he ironically calls \\"the American booboisie\\"). Mencken also is believed to have been an ardent Social Darwinist and was a defender of Darwinism against religion. He also had very idiosyncratic views on race and frequently made deprecating remarks about blacks and Jews (though privately he had many friends of both races), which has led some to claim that he was a racialist. However, his views on race are complicated (as he also attacks Anglo-Saxons and certain points about segregation towards the end of his life) and thus may be seen as despising all races. In terms of religion, Mencken is frequently considered a \\"free thinker\\" and possibly an agnostic or atheist and he frequently refers to himself as a \\"heathen\\" and \\"infidel\\". However, like all things concerning Mencken it is difficult to discern exactly where he stands on any issue, partly because he is frequently contradictory and takes contrary positions merely to be contrary and partly because his intent is frequently humor and thus one can never be certain how serious he is.This book begins with essays by Mencken featuring comments on his early life in Baltimore. Mencken describes the brutal surroundings in which he grew up as well as youthful experiences at the Y.M.C.A. (before he became fed up with their preaching and abandoned it). Mencken would retain a lifelong distrust of religion which frequently bubbled over into hatred. His hatred seems to be particularly directed against various American versions of Protestantism (Baptists and Methodists) as well as \\"puritanism\\" and may have been in part caused by the excessive efforts of religious to prohibit alcohol at the time. (Even G. K. Chesterton was to praise Mencken's efforts against \\"puritanism\\" and Prohibition while at the same time castigating him for his irreligion.) Included also is an essay by Mencken on cops which details Mencken's generally positive experiences and view of them. Mencken sees cops as largely honorable people (he frequently distinguishes between \\"honorable\\" and \\"moral\\", of which he is cynical) and defends them from charges of graft and corruption. Mencken also defends the sort of folk wisdom of the Baltimore policemen, arguing against the intrusion into their domain of more book-learned individuals. Another essay of Mencken's deals with the novelist Theodore Dreiser, a man whom Mencken admires. In a separate essay, Mencken tells the story of his involvement in the Cuban revolution as a reporter. Mencken also has much to say about George Washington (who he admires), Abraham Lincoln (who he also appears to somewhat admire though he maintains that in contrast to his popular image Lincoln did not intend to free the slaves and that Lincoln may have been a non-believer), and the commonplace of lying as well as the universal public hatred of truth-tellers. Mencken also expresses his distrust of democracy (which he sees rooted in envy in the same way as he sees \\"puritanism\\") and the need for a genuine aristocracy (as opposed to the plutocracy). Mencken next goes on about the failure of American letters, he comments again on the failure of democracy and the need for an aristocracy as against the plutocracy, and he also notes the silliness of the obsession with the \\"Reds\\" that existed at the time. Perhaps one of Mencken's best essays is his essay \\"Star-Spangled Men\\" - a highly sarcastic commentary on America's military culture, patriotism, and the absurdity of World War I (Mencken also states that he maintains the same feelings towards World War II). Mencken also exposes the silliness of various fraternal organizations such as the freemasons as well as expresses his hatred for Woodrow Wilson (the arch-puritan). Mencken's commentary on women and the relationship between the sexes is profound (although sure to displease any politically correct feminist). Mencken's views however are not anti-woman, but merely realistic. He shows the differences between the sexes and appears to put woman on a pedestal though noting certain other deceptive aspects of her nature. In an ironical essay on the Anglo-Saxon, Mencken argues against Anglo-Saxon supremacy, maintaining that while the Anglo-Saxon is prone to braggadocio he is largely a coward and a failure. Mencken notes that many in America have Celtic blood and thus are not true Anglo-Saxons. He also appears to praise other European races instead. Some have maintained that this essay on the Anglo-Saxons is an argument for Germanic racial superiority (Mencken was partly Anglo-Saxon himself but mostly German) and thus an expression of disgust at the Anglo-American involvement in the world wars. In other essays, Mencken comments on Holy Writ, music, Prohibition (Mencken is an ardent promoter of alcohol), and religion and Darwinism. Mencken mocks rural people, the religious, anti-Darwinians, chiropractors, Freudians, and much else. In a particularly disgusting essay, Mencken engages in a tirade against populist hero William Jennings Bryan. Mencken also has much to say about F. D. R., Coolidge, the presidency, the Supreme Court (and its horrendous attempts to destroy the rights of Americans), segregation, death, and several other topics.I certainly applaud much of what Mencken says in his efforts to lift up the veil of the political correctness of his day. However, there are certain aspects of Mencken that I find particularly disgusting. For example, in his early essays, Mencken revels in his youthful abuse of animals (something intolerably sickening). Mencken also is a vehement critic of religion and rural people. While Mencken is largely correct about much of American Protestantism, his complete denigration of religion is uncalled for and would make any latter-day elitist liberal proud. (Ironically, Mencken appears to have had some admiration for the Roman Church and may have even predicted the disasters that befell it with the advent of Vatican II. Mencken notes for example that someday they will \\"translate the liturgy into American\\" and thus ruin the Roman mass.) Mencken's comments on rural people are equally disgusting. But, perhaps most disgusting is his assault on the populist Bryan who adamantly opposed Darwinism.Today, Mencken is read by all sorts. Liberals, secularists, and \\"rationalist skeptics\\" frequently express admiration for his comments on religion and rural people; however, they then try to excuse or downplay his racialism, hatred for democracy, hatred for F. D. R., and opposition to World War II. For example, the arch-liberal S. T. Joshi has quoted Mencken on religion while at the same time castigating him for his hatred of Roosevelt. Liberals and genuine conservatives alike have also found an ally in him in their opposition to the \\"neoconservatives\\". On the other hand, Mencken has also found supporters among those who maintain an idolatry of the free market, while they ignore his comments on the \\"plutocracy\\". All such attempts to co-opt him for various modern causes are pretty disgusting overall. In many ways, Mencken himself was a disgusting man who was too arrogant to believe in a personal God and looked down upon rural people. However, in terms of his opposition to World Wars I and II and his hatred of Roosevelt, Mencken is refreshingly correct. Roosevelt is today worshipped by all kinds from leftists to neoconservatives, but his disgusting policies put into effect have utterly decimated the underpinnings of the United States. I am certain that Mencken himself would be horrified were he to witness the world of today.For a modern day iconoclast in the spirit of Mencken, one should consult the works of the late Australian philosopher David Stove. Also, for a book which features Mencken's views as well as those of other political alternatives consult Willis Carto's _Profiles in Populism_."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"Some classic Mencken here. You know you feel uneducated when reading great writers from this period. His vocabulary is amazing. Pointed observations of the times. There are sadly few today that match his depth, whit and humor. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"I have never read anything by Mencken, but it was high time to do it. This is a good beginning. Mencken may be out of fashion, but his newspaper style is very readable, and he had opinions about everything"},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"No doubt the man was a gifted wordsmith and an entertaining read. But his colorful irascibility about practically anything under the sun did get tiresome at some points in this selection. His quasi-obituary about William Jennings Bryan was one hell of a mean-spirited diatribe. Wow, talk about kicking a person when their down. Also, I don't ever recall having to use my electronic dictionary so frequently with any other author. Half the fun was laughing when I discovered the meanings of some of the words he had used. Yet, despite Mr. Mencken's surliness, his remarkable writing and insights made the book well worth reading. Just keep your dictionary handy."},{"Title":"Recovery From Loss","review":"How can you review a book which had no small part in saving your life. I lost my 36 year old, vibrant and beautiful wife to a hit and run (she was a pedestrian) and read dozens of books as part of my healing process. Many had to do with &quot;griefwork&quot;, many were religious in nature and many more dealt with &quot;Life after Death&quot; and near death experiences. If I had to point out one book which had the most positive influence on me in the healing process and was the most comforting, it would have to be Mr. Tagliaferre and Dr. Harbaugh's book, Recovery from Loss. The pain and grief shared by Mr. T after the loss of his own wife after 35 years of marriage was so heartrendering and relevant to what I was going through, it felt at times as if he read my mind. Accompanied by the studies of Dr. Harbaugh, and the plain humanity of both these men makes this a 5 star book. There is griefwork, spirituality, the communion of man and the pain of a man in just the right proportions. If you are looking for a gift to someone who has recently lost a loved one, especially a spouse, or if that person is you, please go out and buy this book. You will be well pleased that you did."},{"Title":"Recovery From Loss","review":"This book could be helpful but it takes too much intellectual effort to construct a personalized grief process plan, which one might not be able to deal with at a time of bereavement. So I recommend reading this book not immediately after your loss, but perhaps a few months later. It relies on the Myers-Briggs Personality classification to help the reader lay out a plan for their own recovery and recommends that the reader gets a professional testing from a certified psychologist. However, an unofficial version of the test is available on the Myers-Briggs website. I feel that one might not muster the strength to deal with figuring such things out at such a difficult time. If you are receiving grief therapy, it might be a good complimentary resource. The information is not overwhelming and the book is very reader-friendly, but you might feel like you are studying a college text or your Psych 101 notes in some parts.The writers often share their own stories of losing loved ones, which helps a little. Hearing of other people's experiences somehow abates the sense of loneliness that seems to be an inextricable part of grief.The book does not have any religious content, but one of the authors is a man of the cloth so naturally the book points to religion too frequently as a way to deal with death. Of course, this can be very helpful, if you do have a religion. If you do not believe in an after-life, you might find the emphasis on using your spiritual resources bothersome, although -to be fair-- the authors also include suggestions for the non-spiritually inclined, such as taking up meditation or looking for solace elsewhere."},{"Title":"Daily Imperfections: 365 364 Ways to Celebrate the Glorious Imperfect You","review":"As a child who was taught to be perfect, it's nice to see the silly side of perfection.

Each chapter starts with a bit of theory which is followed by a tutorial. Thus you get a combined approach that I find works very well. Sometimes you read the theory and are left wondering just what he was talking about, and the tutorial shows you what he means. And conversely sometimes when you get lost in the tutorial having read the theory allows you to get yourself out of trouble.Make no mistake, 3D modelling is not easy. The amount of work involved to get the image you want is significant. A sophisticated software package such as Maya makes it easier, and completely understanding what Maya does is a big help. This book is a good one to help you get there.The book comes with a CD which includes all of the designs that the book describes. This way you can work with what the author has already done and see professional quality work. The CD also includes the Maya 7 Personal Learning Edition."},{"Title":"Introduction to 3D Graphics & Animation Using Maya (Charles River Media Graphics)","review":"This book is very helpful with the New Maya version. Some commands are different but not to many that would keep me from referring to this book for help. The seller also sent the product promptly with no complications on my end. Overall it was a successful transaction."},{"Title":"Introduction to 3D Graphics & Animation Using Maya (Charles River Media Graphics)","review":"This book is an introduction to 3D with Maya as the software package. It provides plenty of discussion on various 3D topics including modeling (polygonal, NURB and organic), rendering, lighting, and character rigging. Nonetheless, the majority of the pages are dedicated to hands on tutorials. The included CD has tutorial files, high resolution images and a copy of Alias Maya 7.0 Personal Learning Edition (PLE).A strong emphasis on clean geometry is among the many useful topics and techniques covered by this book. However, learning from this book typically required working through some very difficult tutorials in an already difficult subject area. The steps in the tutorials generally start out quite detailed, but they eventually get a little vaguer. I believe the idea of this approach is to allow you to finish part of the tutorial on you own. While this approach works for some tutorials, most were just too large and complex. For example, the tutorials in the last chapters cover modeling, texturing and animating a complete Unreal 2004 compatible game character. It was a struggle and I could not complete all parts of this continuing project. Still, I learned quite a bit in the process and surprised myself by completing as much as I did. Nevertheless, for a beginner level book, modeling an arm or a head would have accomplished the same with far less aggravation. This is not a short book with over 400 pages. Yet, a longer book was justified in order to appropriately cover projects of this amount, size and difficulty.The general difficulty aside, there were a few other minor issues with this book and the tutorials. For one thing, the colorless photos were pretty much useless. The high resolution images on the CD were a big help though. Sometimes these images were the only way to understand a given step. Also, this book could have used some more editing as it had plenty of mistakes. There were typos such as repeated and missing words. The names for menu and dialog boxes in the text differed a bit from the included version of Maya that I had installed and used. Occasionally, a minor step was missing or an incorrect image was used (Check the CD for the correct images). There were also many other little inconsistencies that primarily related to layer and object naming.If you are able to get through all the chapters in this book, you will learn quite a bit about Maya and 3D modeling in general. But, it would have been nice if some of the harder projects provided more detailed and complete steps. Instead, you are left to complete much on your own, which is an approach that works better in an easier subject area. For 3D modeling, the tutorials and topics are probably a bit too hard for a true beginner and this is supposed to be a beginner level book. This book simply tries to cover too much material without committing to more pages. Ultimately, this is another book that introduces Maya with great frustrations.Rating: 3.5/5"},{"Title":"Love Poems: Feelings and Fantasies","review":"With spring in the air, love is sure to blossom.
