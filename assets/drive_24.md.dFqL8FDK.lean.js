I loved the idea of running away from home and living off the land (and in my wildest fantasies, I *still* cherish that idea). I suppose everyone has different tastes, but it seems that some of the people who are criticising the book are missing the point: this is fiction. FIC-TION. OK? So maybe no 12 year old boy could survive like Sam did. And of course it wouldn't be safe to try it, not today, not even in the 1950s, when this book is set. I was smart enough to realize that as a 9 year old. (Even so, I remember taking my mom's measuring tape and figuring out just how much room he would have had in that tree). I think imaginative, outdoorsy kids are probably the type who like this book the best. Kids who are horrified rather than intrigued by the prospect of spending a few days without electricity (no computer, no cable TV) might be bored by this book. But then again, they might change their minds as they read of Sam's pioneering ethic. Oh yeah, this also is not just a &quot;boy's book&quot;. I'm a girl (well, I'm a woman now but I was a girl when I first read it) and I loved, loved, loved it.....Actually, if Sam was real and all grown up, I would probably want to marry him!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I have 2 children under 6 yrs old. Even though they can't read yet it makes a wonderful bedtime story to be read out loud.

Thank goodness she sat us down and read it out loud. I don't know if I would have picked it up on my own at that age. Yes, the premise a bit implausible. Trite perhaps.

He knows a little bit about how to survive. Everything around was pretty new to him. He has to live on his own out in the mountains. He finds this falcon and trains it. He has to hunt and build his own supplies.When you're in the mountains all by yourself with strange new wild things around you, you would be scared wouldn't you? I would. This boy Sam wasn't scared. He had enough food and supplies and everything else that he needed. His falcon would help him with whatever he didn't have which wasn't much. Sam was an adventurous boy so he knew how to use a compass and everything.I think that this book was really good. I didn't think it would turn out the way it did, but I can't tell you how it does. The wild life is so cool. I think this is a great book for people that like outdoors and animals.

Sam Gribley was living in the city, and he gets sick of living in the city and runs away from home and he lives in the wilderness on a mountain. In the book he makes his food, it doesn't seem good but its very handy if you're in the wild and very useful information.The reason why he ran away is because he wanted to feel how you can live in the wilderness but he just wanted to be away from the city life. He also made animal friends, but his best friend was Frightful, she was a hawk. He taught her tricks, she was Sam's best friend in the wilderness, but he has a lot of animal friends in the wilderness.The ending of this book is a happy ending, but not for Sam. Sam was sad, but when no humans were there he was happy. The story continues with a different book. If you like adventure and something to do with nature you will like this book. I didn't like this book because I like a good mystery or fiction. But I started liking it when I kept reading it because it helps us because it kind of gives you hint's if you're camping or lost in the wilderness.

I'd never really \\"read\\" a book before like this, kid's say \\"Chapter book\\" now. It isn't that this was the significant thing, it was that the book transported me somehow. I had my share of home issues, ones I deliberately looked beyond all my life. But there was something about this main character, his concentration on his staying in the wilderness, his experiments. He didn't really retread his life or long for home really. I knew that feeling.There are very few things I really admire more than a story that takes you inside a tree, inside a wilderness, inside the training and caring for a self, the independence and the value of doing it for yourself. Craighead George capture the thing that being ten was for me.This is a book that tells the story of a character that decides to leave home and try to make it in the mountains. It's a coming of age kind of thing and it was possible that within it seeds were sewn in my psyche for wanting my own life.I've used it in teaching along with a pretty lousy Disney movie and students read it with the same kinds of personal insights and connections that they might make coming from homes where kids might need to know that they alone one day would shape their own path."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I like the book because it is interesting and good.

I'm typing exactly as he wrote.\\"I think that 'My Side Of The Mountain' is a great book because of the relationship between Sam and the Catskills. The plot is great, but the way he encounters Frightful was horrible. I also like how the story ends.The only thing I didn't like too much was the reason Sam ran away. Also, the organization of the book is a little bit complicated - with the chapters being in a weird order.Overall is a VERY good book and I can't wait to read the sequel.\\""},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is what I call a \\"must-read\\" for anyone. I first read it and read it many times over as a boy in a small town in Virginia. I must have checked it out 5 times at least. It is a story that has \\"inspired\\" my retirement dream of living on the side of a hill somewhere, far from the lights, sirens and bustle that make up so much of our lives today. It will be a joy to have the \\"wild things\\" as neighbors and be able to, even if just for a moment each day be able to be silent, to feel the energy of this planet flow around me.

However, I was one of the boys who planned to copy the character in this book. If I had I probably would have ended up being dead. That said, I enjoyed many wonderful hours as a fifth grader contemplating my GREAT ADVENTURE! I spent hours poring over atlases and planning just where in my state's forests that I would be living and building my home. I read numerous books on survival in wilderness conditions. I practiced with a fire bow and drill. I even cleaned & tanned a fresh roadkill raccoon and made a hat out of it. The time I spent with this story and the dreams this story inspired for me are some of my fondest childhood memories."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"While \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" is not Henry Thoreau it does make an enjoyable read on how to live a self-sufficient life. Think of this as \\"Survivorman meets Jules Verne\\" and you have a nice idea of the general theme.Many have complained that they do not understand the plot and that the action moves to slowly. Personally, I find the pace of the novel to be quite refreshing. What we are given is a story about how someone can learn to become one with nature. This process was nto immediate and it took time to develop so Jean Craighead George allowed the story to move at a natural pace.I first read \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" about 20 years ago when I was still in grade school. Oddly enough, of the dozens of books that I read from that time of my life only \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" and \\"Tales of a 4th Grade Nothing\\" are the only ones that I actually remembered. It is pretty rare that you can find a book that you enjoy as much when you are 33 as you did when you were 11 years old.\\"My Side of the Mountain\\" is written for children and adults alike. We all can dream about what life would be like on our own mountain. Maybe this isn't a book for everyone, but if you or your child enjoys camping, hiking, or just being outside this will probably become one of your own personal classics."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book is a very good book to integrate into your classroom reading library.

We read of Sam as he faces these chalenges and learnes to cope with them to continue his chosen lifestyle. I was inspired as a young teen to learn more about all the concepts within this book, and learned enough that it made my camping experiences much more fun as I tried out some of the concepts like making a fishook from whittled twigs and bark(I think I needed more practice though, I didn't catch anything).My Side of the Mountain shaped how I think about life, and is part of the reason I ultimately chose to live frugally and simply today, and am working towards having a sustaiable garden and small livestock. This is a book I plan to read again even as an adult, and will be happy to pass it on to my children when they are old enough to read at this level.If you like the survival theme, you may also enjoy \\"Tunnel in the Sky\\" by Robert A.

He had a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, and $40 when he left home. He also had flint and steel, a purse for the ashes, and some tinder. He would use these things as he began his venture in the forest. Sam realized that he must first find shelter and food, which he would begin storing. He cleared rotted wood from an old tree trunk and made his home there. He found food in the forest, in the form of roots, berries, nuts, and small game. He became a conservationist by using only what he needed. As his clothing needed to be repaired and replaced, he used the skins of the animals he killed for food. He relied upon his instincts and his ingenuity for surviving in the Catskills, whether he encountered hunters, faced the savage weather and temperatures, or needed to care for himself..During this time he had very little contact with other people. He went into town infrequently, and he tried to avoid most of the hikers and sightseers he would encounter in the woods. His closest companion was a falcon he trained and named Frightful. However, one day he learned that someone was writing about a wild boy who lived in the Catskills, based upon an encounter Sam had with a berry picker. As people went into the woods searching for him, he became more cautious about whom he met. He decided that he did want to be found, and he gave an interview to a reporter. Eventually his parents found him, and they moved to the Catskills."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Are you into nature fiction books?

I can still remember dreaming about holing up in a tree house on a mountain somewhere while a great blizzard decends, the wind howling through the tree limbs. And surviving off the wilderness, trapping deer and fishing, hiding out from grownups. It was a tremendous adventure that has stayed with me through the years.I recently bought this book for my 8-year old boy, but he's still pouring through the Harry Potter series (again), so I re-read it. It's still tremendous after all these years--the adventure every boy dreams of. It's a story of total independence and making it on your own, and the hero is as brave and resourcefull as I dreamed I would be if it were me on that mountain. The book is as entertaining today as it was back then. I know my boy will love it. It's magic without witchcraft."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am 10 years old and have just read this book for my monthlybook report. I am a big fan of this book, My Side Of The Mountain. Theauthor of this book is Jean Craighead George. The main characters ofthe book are Sam Gribley, Frightful , and The Baron Weasel. Sam Gribley is a boy 15 years old who ran away from home to live on the Catskill Mountains. He ran away from home because there were11 poeple in his family, 4 brothers, 4 sisters and 2 adults plus Sam. Frightful is Sam's falcon, he took her from her nest when she was a baby and raised her. He also had a friend named The Baron Weasel who he caught in his trap.My favorite chapter in the book is when Sam found Frightful a falcon so that he wouldn't get lonely. My second favorite chapter is When The City Comes To Me. And it is when his family comes to visit Sam. His Mom wants him to live in the barn until he is 16 but he doesn't want to.The chapter that I liked the least was I Cooperate With The Ending. I found this chapter to be sad because I was really interested in the book and I didn't want it to end.When my Aunt was in grade school she recommended this book to my Dad who was also in grade school. My Dad recommened this book to me and gave it to me for Christmas. When my brother is old enough I will recommended this book to him. The reason why I would recommended it to my brother or anyone is because it is a good book, full of adventure and excitement and I really enjoyed it. This book made me feel like I was in the story as one of the characters."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Dare I admit how many years ago I was but a girl, nose buried in this book? Decades, oh, decades ago. Yet even now it stands out as one of the beacon lights of my childhood, leading me to an adulthood that focuses around a love of wilderness.When young Sam ran away from home (and this is something I routinely did as a girl, tying red bandana to a stick containing crackers, kitchen knife, and toothbrush, and rather long to do again, now as I spend too many of my days in an office) and headed into the Catskill Mountains, my heart went with him. No dream house could match the home he created inside the hollow of a big tree. No gourmet dinner could match the wilderness fare Sam put together, smacking his lips. No pet could match that fine falcon.Jean Craighead George was then, and is now, at the top of the list of my favorite authors in children's and young adult literature. My own children are grown now, but as they grew, I read George's books to them, giving them not only a taste of fine writing, but also an education in science and wilderness survival, along with a healthy respect for environmental issues. George may write fiction, but her stories are all based on sound scientific data. How Sam survived on the mountain is based on good science. That he uses determination, intelligence, and discipline in living this way is good character. And that's something our kids don't see or read about nearly often enough today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book, My Side of the Mountain, by Jean Craighead George is a great book. The main character, Sam Gribley, runs away from his New York City apartment one day to seek a new and independent life. Sam chooses to live in the Catskill Mountain because his Grandfather once owned a farm there. While Sam is there, he meets many friends. Some of his new friends are people, and some are animals. Sam's best friend and helper is a falcon he calls Frightful. Sam also shows lots of courage and tolerance in this book. Sam was very courageous during the blizzard that hit the mountain. Sam shows tolerance because he eats things he's never eaten before such as rabbit, crayfish, and vension.

Available on Amazon."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"The book I read was My Side of the Mountain. Jean Craighead George is the author. My Side of the Mountain is about a teenager who is sick of living in the city. He lives in an apartment with his family in New York City but is unhappy there, so he runs away to the Catskill Mountains where his grandfather has some property. He tries to survive against the brutal winter and ice covered trees, hunters during the deer season, and tries not to be seen by hikers and campers. The setting in the book is in the 1960's or 70's and takes place in New York. The main character in the story is named Sam Gribley. Sam is adventurous and does not like to be kept inside. He can make tools out of stuff you can find in the woods. He is also very brave and courageous for going and staying in the woods alone.This book is realistic fiction. The moral of the story is if you want something, do something about it. I highly recommend this book for others because it is great how the author explains everything. Sam makes different tools out of twigs and grass and the author explains every detail. The book is also very adventurous and exciting. If you want a book where you hate to stop reading, then this is a great book!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I will give you my opinion of this book: WONDERFUL. But we all have our own opinions, but no matter what you read in any of the reviews, including mine, that does not mean you would like it or not. No, you don't have to be a naturalist, book worm, or an adventure lover to like this book. This story is about a young teenage boy whose name is Sam Gribley. He lives in a large family in New York, and has the desire to run away in the woods. He wanted to do something different. This might be suprising, but his parents had agreed to this, although the Father thought he would be back soon. Then again, if Sam did succeed he would come and visit. Happily Sam arrives in the Catskills mountains, not knowing the unexpected suprises that was to come. Jean Craighead George, the author of this book had become a naturalist since she was very young, and had been through the same thing, which inspired her to write this. Being a wonderful writer and a natualist, this book is greatly detailed on survival, enviroment, food, , animals, and many other things that you would like to know about living in the wilderness. Sam befriends a College Professer, whom he calls Bando, and becomes great friends, also with some other residents of the town after he came. But the most important friend, I will say is Frightful. Who is Frightful you may ask? A Peregrine Falcon, which Sam climbed desperatly on a high ledge, and managed to get. Sam had many wild companians in the forest, but he also needed a provider. He trained Frightful to hunt for him, giving him extra time to finish many other tasks. Basiclly this book is about Sam, Frightful, and the Catskill mountains, trying to survive day by day, and succeeding. This is a absorbing book, and you would not want to put the book down the minute you read it. If you find this book dull in the first time you read it, I strongly recommend reading it slower, and in a later date. That should make easier to understand. This ends my review. Remember, this is a book all readers of any age might like. Not boyish, girlish, saddening, or too lively. It is one of those rare books, that atleast everyone will strike interest in."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Sam Gribley is just an average city kid who knows what he really wants, to live off the land. He is never taken seriously by anyone. When he tells everyone he running away they laugh. He gets to the Catskills and starts anew home. He makes plenty of new friends, including Frightful, his trained falcon.He learns to live off the land.When he is discovered several times he either befriends them or waits for them to leave. I'm sure you'll love this book while you also learn facinating facts. &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot; is pure genius."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is a wonderful five star book. I like it because it has amazing survival things that I wouldn't ever think of. This book is mostly enjoyed by people who like survival, or just seeing how they do it. This novel is also enjoyable by people who are interested in things that happen in the wild. This novel is about a boy named Matt who runs away from home to live in the mountains. He lives, but it is tough at the start. He makes a home from a tree and trains a falcon that can hunt for him, he also makes many friends. This book is by Jean Craighead George, and was made perfect for many people, it also has a lot to do with animals, so people who like animal books might like this too, it is a great survival book, and I recommend getting it now."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"In 1959, Jean Craighead George invited us all to visit the Catskill Mountians. She introduced us to a boy who lived there with a weasel, racoon, falcon, and an assortment of other friends. His name was Sam Gribley, and his year there would change his life.That is the plot of the modern classic &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot;. Sam's coming-of-age is contained within the pages of that novel. The reader will feel like he/she is Sam when they read it because of all of the vivid descriptions. I wasn't me when I was reading it. I was on Sam's mountain, with his falcon, living his life. I didn't want it to end--and pleased to discover the sequel, &quot;On the Far Side of the Mountain&quot;.While the book isn't as classic as &quot;My Side&quot; is, (and a bit disappointing because of much change) it's good in its own way. Female fans of the author (Jean Craighead George) will enjoy this very much because of the spunky new herione, Sam's sister Alice, who has come to live with him on the mountain--or has she? The plot thickens when she disappears (just a day after Frightful is confascated by the confasation officer!) While the book can bug you at some times, finish it. The last three chapters make up for any and all of that with a powerfully heart-wrenching ending, which will strongly move you. I even cried after it, even though I know what happened--I'll leave that a mystery--was for the best.Jean Craighead George has done it again. These two books are genuine treasures. This gift set is a must-have, and any nature lover would love to be given it. I'm as sure of it as Sam Gribley's falcon is Frightful. It also may be enjoyable to compare Sam to Julie (from &quot;Julie of the Wolves&quot;) and Liza K (from &quot;The Missing 'Gator of Gumbo Limbo&quot;), both also authored by Jean. Any way you look at it--I don't see one reason why this isn't a good buy. You won't ever forget Sam, Frightful, The Baron Weasel, Jessie Coon James, Bando, Zella, Crystal, Miss Turner, Mrs. Strawberry, or Alice. I know I'll return to their mountain again soon.ALSO RECCOMENDED: &quot;Frightful's Mountain&quot; &quot;The Missing 'Gator of Gumbo Limbo&quot; &quot;Julie of the Wolves&quot; &quot;Hatchet&quot; (by Gary Paulsen)"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I would like to reccommend this novel to a friend because I enjoyed reading about the adventures this young boy experienced while living and surviving alone in the wilderness for a year."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I loved this book because it had adventure and was very exciting.

Actually, the whole thing seemed a little boring for me. The only thing that seemed to interest me was the things that Sam learned on his survival jorney.

Firstly, his attitude of being friendly is surpising. In addition, the way how he tries his best nomatter what is also another thing i admire about him."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I would recommend this book to a friend because it was interesting to learn about how a person can survive in the wilderness.

I say that with all sincerity, and do not mean to sound sappy. My teacher read it to us when I was in the 6th grade, in 1973. I read it again the next year. It so captured my imagination, that I begain reading everything I could on wilderness survival, which led me to a backpacking book. The latter further piqued my interest in the outdoors, and I joined the Boy Scouts, soley to go on a backpacking trip to northern New Mexico, to Philmont Scout Ranch. Afterward, I became an Eagle Scout, and a straight A student, eventually going to medical school, while working summers at Philmont. Today, I spend my time in the outdoors, practicing catch and release fly fishing. I plan to buy this for my kids, and someday take them to the Catskills for vacation, including a little fly fishing on the West Branch of the Delaware River, which runs through Delhi!

So I decided to venture into some of her other books that didn't involve Julie. My Side of the Mountain, while interesting, only ranked average for me.Sam is tired of his life in the city in a small apartment shared with many other siblings. He runs away from home and goes to some old family land in the Catskill mountains where he plans to live by himself and without any help except that he can find for himself in the wild. He spends his days looking for food and building shelter, and also training a very special falcon named Frightful to hunt for him. But he encounters visitors as one does anymore no matter where you go and he has to decide if he wants to let them into his life or not.For characters, Sam is interesting but seems to be able to survive a little too well for his age. Things come a little easy and while I know this is a fictional kid's book, there has to be some reality. For example, this is what bothers me about the rest of the characters in this book. No one seems to have a problem with Sam running off and living in the wilderness on his own. I would think that at least one of the adults he encounters would have a problem with this and put a stop to it, but none every do. It is just hard for me to suspend belief for that.This is a slow moving book and may not be appropriate for all children due to that or hold their attention. It does give a lot of good detail and information about the plants you can eat and other wilderness survival tactics. Whether or not this information is completely factual I cannot say as I don't know that much about it, but it sounded believable.While I prefer her other works, I may check out the rest of this series.

By reading this novel whether you're a child or an adult and has been around for decades, it is the story of Sam Gribler, a 15 year old boy, disgruntled with life in New York City. He sets out for life in the Catskill Mountains. There he has to learn how to survive without the basic necessities or electricity or indoor plumbing. The author carefully uses Sam as an example of a rebellion towards nature and wilderness as the final frontier and away from the corrupt and dirty world of city living.While the story is fictitious, most 15 year olds would never leave their cell phones, television, radios, internet, and anything electronic behind in today's world. Sam is still an inspiration to get out and spend time in the wilderness even if you don't build your own home in a tree, hunt and fish for food, or spend time with Frightful, a Falcon companion.I am curious as to why Sam really went there in the first place. I still feel like the author needs to explain giving up city living or living in civilization before venturing out into the wilderness. I get hints at the end about Sam's reasons but not truly. It's kind of vague. Most boys his age are preoccuppied with the opposite sex and to give that up for a life possibly alone like hermit is a little far-fetched but anything is possible, isn't it?"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Just what my Grandaughter needed.

The author finished the book to quickly I think kind of slacked off on the job at the end. I still recomend the book \\"My side of the Mountain\\" though, to anyone who likes survival and adventure books. A fantastic read."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is a great book. I loved the story and how he thought how to use everything he saw to his advantage. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"The book \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" was a lot of fun to read. This book was full of adventures and thrills. I would definately recommend this book to kids of my age group. I am twelve years old and I think other twelve year olds would relate to this book well. They would relate to this book because the boy in this book is 12 and 13 years old and what he does would be possible for other boys to do. This book is about a boy in a large family who ran away because his house is too crowded and no one believed that he would run away. Because his father doubted that he would run away for more than one day, he decided to run away. The characters name is Sam Gribley. He is from New York and ran away to the Catskill Mountains. He is away from home for about 9 months. While he was out there he met some people and went to different places on the way. I like how he was very independent and built a house in a tree. Sam is very talented because he was able to capture and train a falcon, catch his own food, make his own dishes and silverware and start fires. Some of the people he met in the mountain sound like people you would meet today. There was a character named Gambo who was a teacher, but who Sam thought was a theif. There was also a character named Matt, he was a boy who worked for the New York Gazette, and he was in the mountain looking for the \\"wild boy\\". The reason he was looking for Sam was because Sam had become famous and known as the \\"wild boy\\", because he was living in the mountain and no one knew who he was. One day he heard a voice calling his name and he knew at once that it was his father. He ran down the mountain to greet him, and his father said that he was famous in New York. His dad stayed with him for a couple of nights and shared with him what he had done. The ending was unexpected and you should read this book to find out!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain by Jean George follows the story of young Sam. Sam, an unhappy pre-teen is tired of his busy city life. He has no privacy and can't seem to get away from the yelling and crying of his brothers and sisters! Later he tells his family he is going to run away to their grandfather's old piece of land in the forest. There he learns survival techniques and how to cope with the strange seasons. Sam also meets people and animals that seem like family. The winter will be coming soon! Will Sam be ready or will he freeze in the snow?The pros of this story are that you could picture every word and you could understand it, too! It had amazing characters and an interesting plot. The cons of this story are that at some parts it can get slow and boring. The ending also could have been changed so when you finished the book you wouldn't be so discouraged. Overall this book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Sam Gribly is sick of New York with all his little brothers and sisters running around, so he decides to run away into the Catskill Mountains. He brings [price], some string/cord, an ax, some flint and steel and a penknife. He has to find/catch his own meals. These are a few of the meals he had: venison (deer), turtle soup, smoked rabbit and dried apples. He decides that finding food is a hard task and wishes he could have help with hunting, so he sets off to find the best kind of hunter that he can think of (that is tame-able) a duck-hawk. He finds a baby duck-hawk, trains it to his arm and teaches it how to hunt.He meets a man he calls Bando, and they become friends. Sam has many adventures, and meets many animals and people such as a weasel, he calls \\"the Baron weasel.\\"My favorite character was the Baron Weasel because he was unpredictable. An example of this is when he came up to Sam and bit him.I would recommend this book because it is fun and adventurous. An example of how it was fun is when Sam met a music teacher named Aaron, who was out hiking. Sam started singing some pretty weird songs to Aaron, such as \\"The Cold Water\\" song and the \\"Hi-Chickadee\\" song. It was adventurous when Sam took a baby duck-hawk and trained it. I think it took courage and bravery to go live in the wilderness alone, without the comforts of home."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am a sixth grader. I thought My Side of the Mountain was a very good book. It was a very adventurous book. It is about a kid named Sam who has dreamed to run away from home. He found a tree that was big enough for him to live in and he burned out the inside of it to make a house. Sam goes through harsh weather and eats only berrys, turtle soup, and some meat that he hunts for. I loved this book so much and i would recamend this book for people who like adventure books. I would rate this book a five star book because it was so good and there was a lot of intresting things in this book, like what kind of food is good to eat in the woods and what kinds of food isn't so good to eat. I really enjoyed this book. But to find out if Sam makes it through the winter and all the harsh weather you will have to read the book and find out what happens at the end."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"even though i'm not as old as the protesters, (well at least some of them) I'd like to stand up for this book. It was a reasonably good story, however unbelievable the doods are, like ze falcon getting tamed...at least it wasn't a wild tiger getting tamed! But it was written in 1959! What do you expect anyway? An up-to-date, '21st century' info etc.?

Kids who like adventures would love it.In the school holidays I am going camping with my brothers"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"As I say in my title, it was okay. I'd actually say more of a 3 and half than a four. The book is about a boy who ran away from home and decided to live in the woods. I think that it's very good compared to another one of her books, Water Sky (which I also reviewed). Jean Craighead George does a decent job on this. There just isn't enough action in it to keep me enthrawlled."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I chose this book because one of friends said that this book was really exciting and fun to read. At first I didn't believe him because I have never heard of this book from anybody else so I thought nobody else liked it. I decided to try it so I went to the library and checked it out. Right when the first chapter was over I wanted to read more. The book was really easy to understand and it was pretty descriptive. I also learned some new words.I recommend this book to anybody that likes to read about animals and also like adventurous stories. This story is about a boy named Sam who thought that New York City was too crowded so he went to Catskill Mountain. There he lived in a hollow tree. To get food he sometimes gets berries, but to get meat he waits for the hunters to kill a deer and still it before the hunters get to the deer. In this story Sam also steals a baby falcon. He feeds it until it finally grows up to find its own food. When he stole the baby hawk the mother went back to the nest when he was there and hits him. Sam quickly runs away and the mother doesn't notice anything.My favorite part of the story is when Sam gets the baby falcon. First he checks out a book from the library about birds. He studies it went out to look for one. He looked everywhere and finally finds a nest of baby falcons. He studies the mother to see when she leaves and when she comes back so he could get one when the mother leaves. One day when the mother left he quickly went to the nest and got a baby falcon, but right when he grabbed on the mother came back and hit Sam. Sam quickly ran away and the mother falcon didn't notice that one of her babies was missing. Sam takes home the baby bird and feeds it every single day until it can get its own food."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"How many books can you encounter in childhood and carry with you all your life? I didn't know how important this book was to me until I introduced it to the next generation and found we could still enter that tree house, wonder about the moss growing as a dietary supplement... admire the ingenuity and the need for safety which this young protagonist handles first through pain and then through self-awareness and determination. This novel takes us to a mountain landscape where the basic needs of survival are met and where the basic needs of humanity: fun, love, power and belonging also take form as the seasons roll on. It is a story of hope. A great book to read aloud and one that should be read in episodes so that every inch of the valley, every minor quandary can be given due regard as you continue in the daily routine. Escapism and its opposite all in one. Many more have followed in this genre... does it have a name? Survivalist adventures? Paulsen's \\"Hatchet\\", Lasenby's \\"The Lake\\", Scott O'Dell... enjoy."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side Of The Mountain-This book was a very good book,it had interesting parts in it.It's about a boy named Sam who goes into the wilderness and trys to survive.He survives on fish and nuts and makes a map of \\"Catskills\\".So i would recomend this book for all ages if i read the book and it was a fantastic book i think you people out there will like it too.So read the book and"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book was about a boy who ran away from home and had to survive by nature.

I'm glad she did!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"It's interesting how some people have such an ibility to survive in the wild like Sam did. Now that you think of it do you think that ANY twelve year old boy that wasn't raised by wolves could survive alone in the winter at the top peak of a mountain in the catskills? I think not!!! Bears, lack of food and shelter oh please! It's kinda boring but it's a cool story and it's good for those rainy days, but I wouldn't suggest buying it at all- go to the library! ..."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I realize this book has already been anointed as a great children's book, and a great book for boys, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. My 14-year-old son loved this book when he read it in elementary school, and my 9-year-old daughter is loving it in fourth grade presently.That being said, the people at Puffin dodged the issue of a child in the wilderness by making a cover where Sam looks like a teenager instead of the 11 or 12-year-old he looks like in Jean Craighead George's illustrations. There were numerous occasions in the book where Sam could have been seriously injured or killed, and George just blurbs or whooshes past them.The back cover said Sam was terribly unhappy with living in New York City, but the book doesn't suggest that anywhereI was impressed with the level of natural knowledge Sam possessed, and I was impressed that my children could come up with plausible ways that he acquired this knowledge. I considered the bit about hunger having an intelligence to be particularly clever.Maybe the moral of the story is that as a parent, I could tell my kids without fear of contradiction that they are nowhere near as knowledgeable regarding the wild as Sam Gribley was, and that Sam was rather lucky in a few spots."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"i bought it for my kid and i got tired of getting this request for a review. the book is prolly a good read. my review is done now"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is a great book. Jean Craighead George must have spent a lot of time in the forest. Her descriptions of the landscape and anecdotes regarding the animals are vivid.

A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I think this book was an ok book. I think this because i like the outdoors and i like camping.

My opinion is that I didn't really like the book."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I read the book My Side of the Mountian by Jean Craighead George. The book starts out with this boy Sam Gribly who wants to run away from his family with only some flint and $40.00 because he feels his family is to large. With a family of 11 I would too. So he goes to find his grandpa's farm. He finds it. And then he hollows out a old hemlock tree for his house. During the course of the book he makes a chimny in his house so he can warm it during the harsh winter, and he makes a couple friends too. This was a kind of boring book. I gave it 2 stars because at some points he sounds like he is going insane because he keeps on hearing his bird talk to him and he talks to himself often too."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is about a determined boy named Sam who thinks he can do anything.

I wanted to run away and do the same! This was a spectacular book, yet I am still looking for a fictional survival book where the main character knows ABSOLUTELY nothing about surviving, and where he/she does not have luck as do many of the main charcters in other stories. But this was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This was a good book, in my opinion.

This book left me in awe, and I ALWAYS regreted having to put it down to do something else. There's just no turning back once you read the first page. No, let me change that. There's just no turning back once you read the first WORD (I)! For an all-too brief time (the time during which I was reading this book) I was not me. I was Sam Gribley, living off the land, rasing and befriending the woodland creatures (The Baron Weasel, Jessie Coon James, and others), and rasing his beautiful falcon, Frightful. It changed the way I look at our world, and I will never forget it. This is one to cherish. Everyone wants to journey somewhere else and live a life of glory there, but few of us make it. We all can do it by simply reading this grand book and puting ourselves in Sam's shoes. It's a roller-coaster ride that will be loved forever and ever."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I thought this book started out making me feel interested to keep reading the book. I like how the author put interesting details to go along with the informative ways to make assorted things ranging from food, all the way to how to make a home in a BIG tree. It\`s also interesting how he finds his pet and trains it to do the things he wants it to. I would love to have the skills he posseses. And the way he deals with the assorted animals is really amazing, and how he makes freinds with alot of them. And then there is the wide variety of animals that were mentioned.What I don\`t like is the way he almost lets his self get found and how he just went home when his mother said so. He could have at least resisted a little.

If you like the outdoors and the thought of living there this would be an excellent book for you. This was one of the most detailed yet still exciting books I have ever read. The book was about a young boy that did what all of us always tried or wanted to do. He ran away from home and learned how to live on his own at the age of 12. He made friends with all sorts of different forest animals and made a few friends with people that lived around the house that he built from a large tree.

He makes some unexpected friends along the way. Frightful, Sam's pet Falcon, is loyal and acts as a security alarm by squawking at approaching dangers. The Baron, a weasel, and Bando, a human, are also very well written side characters.

I hated reading before my parents found me this book and it opened the door to the written word for me. That was 30 years ago and my edition is still a treasure (albeit in pieces) in my book collection. The pen and ink illustrations throughout the book (and on the original cover) were a major influence as well. I loved them as a kid and still today as a professional artist. To me the pen and ink cover art is the only true cover. I have tolerated full-color attempts to capture the book but all have fallen short. When I saw this cover, I had to comment. What the heck is that creature flying to Sam's arm? What art director approved this and what artist was so insensitive to this book's readership that he would paint this? Readers of this book love nature and know something about it. We know a falcon when we see it and this mutated goshawk is not it. I vote we return to the original cover!If we must endure full-color art for the cover could we please have capable artists that love the story and know how to illustrate wildlife? Please?"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is a young adult classic which chronicles a year in the life of Sam Gribbley. Sam leaves his overcrowded home in New York City to seek out the farmland of his ancestors, and learns to survive on the land in the company of a cast of wild creatures. My Side of the Mountain serves as a guidebook at times, as Sam informs his readers what plants are edible, how to make a bed, and how he manages to make leather for his deerskin suit. It is a charming story for young children.As an adult reading the novel to my toddler I have one problem - comma splices. Oh, the comma splices! I am not a grammarian by any stretch of the imagination, but the errors in George's novel make it very difficult to read out loud."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I read the book, My Side of the Mountain, and thought it was okay. I was not in love with it, nor did I hate it. I like how it is done in a journal entry sort of way, and how Sam took notes on certain things throughout the novel. While I was reading the story, I often wondered how Sam survived in the woods by himself with no food or shelter. At times, I thought the book was boring, and I was dreading to read on. There were also moments when I really enjoyed the book and had trouble putting it down. When I finished it, I was not sad that it was over like I am with some books. I was actually sort of excited that I was through. I think it is more of a nature person book or a boy book. I don't recommend it for girls, unless they love the woods and survival of the fittest kinds of novels.

Sam(the runaway boys' name) learns to live in the wild all by him self for a year and 4 months , in that time he has learned to cook and make a home out of nature."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I remember finding this book when I was 10 years old and in the 5th grade, and loving every page of it. As my parent's property adjoined a state park, and a large mountain covered in streams and hiking trails was right at my doorstep, it was easy for me to envision myself living this story. Unfortunately, the coastal hills of Northern California did not contain every aspect of this book -- for the life of me, I could not find a single tree big enough to carve out my own little fortress. I loved this story, and read it several times - it inspired many school projects on nature, hikes in search of indigenous and edible plants, and many unsuccessful attempts at building traps for rabbits and birds.And then I forgot about the book for 20+ years, until this summer. I was with my oldest son at the city library, who just became a Webelo Scout, and we were looking for books about nature and camping and such - when suddenly I remembered the story, and found the book on the shelf. Of course, my son's reaction was predictable: any book that Dad was so enthusiastic about could not possibly be worth reading. So I did the Dad thing and told him to read two chapters, and if he didn't like it, I'd give him $5. He took the bait, and forgot all about the bribe. He absolutely loved it.What more do you need to know about this book?"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the MountainMy Side of the Mountain is showing relationships between nature and a teenage boy. Also it is showing relationships between the boy and the other people. I think this book has many good parts, however, I do not like this book because of some reasons.First, I think a teenage boy cannot survive in a mountain alone. Suppose you are in a mountain alone. The most important thing is food, but food is very hard to get in a wild mountain. You have to find some fruits to eat, but sometimes those can have poisons, so it is dangerous. You can hunt for your food. But if you do not have any tools to hunt, the hunting is impossible. Also, there are many dangerous animals in wild. You probably be a prey of those animals.Second thing that I do not like is it does not have that many details about tools that he used. This story's main character Sam actually used many tools to hunt, enjoy, and survive, but I could not understand the tools."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Written by Gene Craighead George, My Side of the Mountain explores one boy's quest for peace and quiet and his realization of what it means to be alone. An adolescent boy, Sam, escapes the chaos of his family's crowded New York apartment. Sam runs away, to the Catskill Mountains in search of space and independence. Sam feels like a free man up in the mountains. He learns to live off the land. He manages to ward off reporters, tourists, and hikers, so that he may preserve his secret living quarters. Sam faces many hardships, but his determination, to live on his own, helps him persevere. Through his interaction with neighboring animals and his friendship with his pet falcon, Sam survives hardships on the lonely mountain. Sam is content with his life in the mountains, but he realizes that he misses human conversation.This interesting and exciting book shows Sam's journey away from his fellow humans and his need to be amongst them again. Sam's great journey is inspiring to anyone who has ever just wanted to escape for a while. The plot is developed through Sam's struggle to survive nature and his inner conflicts.I recommend this book to people of all ages. I believe this story appeals to children because of the adventure and excitement of running away to an unknown place. Adults will find it appealing because they understand the need to be away from the chaos of crowds and cities to find a haven of peace and quiet. Our hectic lifestyles help us relate to Sam's desire for simplicity."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I liked this book because I thought it was adventure-filled. In this book I learned how to make willow whistles, how to soften a skin, and how to survive in the wild. I also learned that you can eat tubers and crow eggs, if you can get to them!

He named the baby falcon Frightful. In one of the chapters Sam Gribley invited his animal friends but the trash his treehouse.

My purpose for reading the book was to see if I agreed with the critics. I looked at the main character, the setting, and the plot to see how realistic each of them was.The main character is Sam Gribley, a teenage boy who lives in a small apartment in New York City with ten other members of his family. He's the oldest and feels totally suffocated and cramped. I would, too. Sam makes the decision to run away, to live on his great-grandfather's farm in the Catskill Mountains. He's not in a violent or dangerous situation at home. He's getting out to attempt to live comfortably on his grandfather's land. The goal sounds realistic to me. Sam's definitely an outdoorsy guy who would rather live close to nature than in the concrete jungle of New York City. He brings a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, $40, and a flint and steel kit for starting fires. (I would have also brought a first aid kit for the inevitable accidents.) I believe the character of Sam is a realistic one.The main setting of My Side of the Mountain is Sam's great-grandfather's abandoned farm in the Catskill Mountains of New York. It is about a mile from the main highway and within walking distance of a small town. The land is within a national park and is very lush with vegetation and animals. It has plenty of water and fish. I was near there in July and think it would be very possible to survive there in the summer. The winter is a whole other matter! It can get very cold and snowy, and I question whether Sam could survive in the cold. It did not appear that Sam lost any weight over the winter. That does not seem very realistic to me.How realistic is the plot? It's realistic that Sam would want to run away from his crowded New York life. But does he have the skill sets to survive on his own in the wilds of the Catskill Mountains? By just reading a book, he could identify safe plants to eat, purify water, and make shelters. But I question his ability to know how to butcher a deer, skin it, and make clothes for himself out of the hide, just by reading a book. I also question his ability to train a falcon to hunt for him just by reading a book. The difficulties or trouble that he experiences during his year-long stay in the mountains are minimal compared to what would have happened in real life.In conclusion, I agree with the critics that the book is not as realistic as it could be, especially the plot. However, it's still a good book, that's exciting and fun to read and gives you food for thought. I think the author wanted the chance to write a book that incorporated as many survival skills as possible and to inspire her readers to get out into nature themselves."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book was one of my favorites as a child. It is a great narrative of the adventure, and highs and lows that the main character faced.

I particularly liked \\"Thoreau\\"."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I read this book as a child. It was so exciting that I never forgot it. I am so happy to be able to share it with my grandchildren. It is a timeless tale that any young reader will enjoy. Sure to be a favorite of all who read it."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"There are books that contain glaring problems but can still be read and enjoyed for their positive elements without the negative ones damaging the readers. Meanwhile, the story's potentially detrimental messages can be used by parents or teachers for instruction in \\"what not to do\\". My Side of the Mountain falls into this category.Sam Gribley is sick and tired of crowded New York City living with his family. The solution he comes up with is secretly running away. Stop right there. This sounds like a terrible book. Why would you let your child read this? Well, first of all, I wouldn't let my young children read this without a healthy dose of teaching before and/or during the read. It is not okay to run away; what Sam did was deceitful, rebellious, and selfish.Once we get past Sam's wrong choice to flee his home, we follow him into the Catskill Mountains, where he becomes a modern-day Robinson Crusoe. Raised in New York, he has little knowledge of living in the wild, but he's forced to learn in a hurry, or he won't survive. I think there's a piece of every last one of us that finds intrigue in living off the land and nothing else. There's the excitement, the unknown, the danger, but also a taste of primitive olden-day life that we as Americans find fascinating. Sam makes his home in a hollowed-out tree and sets to work learning what he can eat, what he can use to hunt, and what animals he can trust and befriend. It's a stark transition from New York City into the uninhabited mountains, and I'm willing to bet you'll find yourself feeling a little wistful at Sam's new-found lifestyle.Recommended read-alone age: 12 and upRecommended read-aloud age: all agesIf you'd like to read more of my book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I first read this book in Jr.High for a book report and loved it.

Sam soon encounters many ways to live off the land along with his falcon, Frightful, the Baron Weasel, and Jessie C. James. This book also has illustrations of just how and what he is doing such as how to make your own fishing hook and where to fish.

Wonderful!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"You *could* worry about this book by looking at it this way: *My Side of the Mountain* will give your child wanderlust, give him/her lots of hints about living alone in the woods, does not mention psitacoccis (a bird disease I probably just misspelled), or roving bands of wild dogs or rabid chipmonks, or serial killers. The book is about Sam, who manages to survive and thrive in the wilderness, befriend Frightful, a falcon, and spend little or no time worrying about his family.But there is nothing at all to worry about as far as the influence of this book is concerned. Quite the contrary.*My Side of the Mountain* will not send children into the wilderness in droves. Tenting in the back yard continues to be our preferred style of camping rough. The book, any child will know, is fantasy. Safe fantasy.And perhaps above all else this is a marvelously *safe* book: we know we can't be like Sam (leaving family for the wild), but we can love thinking about it. Children can wallow in a tale of independence. And perhaps one day I'll find out whether or not Sam is right, and water takes the bitterness out of acorn flour.But this book gives more than nature lessons. Sam manages on his own; in so doing he lives our most fun and most feared fantasy -- that of growing up."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I love this book, this is the first book I ever read all the way to the end.

Not even Steven King can come close."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Without the mountain in My Side Of The Mountain the book would have no point and would be extremely dull. But it does, and it's in the Catskills so the book was pretty good. In My Side Of The Mountain the beginning of the story is mainly about a boy that leaves home and tries to live on his own on the side of a mountain. This book was helpful because throughout the book it shows pictures of edible and nonedible plants both on and off the mountain. Sometimes he leaves the side of the mountain and goes into town, but only once or twice. So, without the mountain in My Side Of The Mountain this book would have no point what so ever.Some of the events that surprised me were when the pseudonym grabbed a rare falcon baby, (later named Frightful) and jumped down a really steep cliff. My disbelief was suspended when the pseudonym jumped down a cliff and other numerous times throughout the book one of them being the climax and the resolution. But sadly, I'm not going to tell you about that, partially because I'm mean."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I thought that this book was an ok book it was not very realistic .

But it was a little unbeliveable because most kids his age don't want to run away for no good reason. It's because that most kids that would run away like that problt wouldn't live so good off the land like that.

I love fishing,hunting,and the outdoors. When I first started reading this book I thought it was going to be boring. But as I got farther on in the book when Sam started to fish, hunt and learned every day survivor in the wilderness,I got to liking it better and better.And all that cool stuff Sam made, man it was AWESOME! Me and my mom both love the show Survivor so between the book and the show, Survivor is a big thing to us. So my mom and I really liked this book. My mom and I couldn't stop reading it.

I simply loved the book. In fact, all my brothers read it too, and they liked it just as much as I. I highly recommend this book, and I can hardly wait until I have a son around that age to give this book as a gift.The book challenges your imagination and increases your desire to go outside and explore. In today's world where everything seems to involve television or computers, this book is the perfect solution to change that."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I remember as kid growing up first reading this book. It is one of those wonderful stories that has stayed with me my whole life. Growing up in the north I could really relate to the character and often dreamed of doing what he did.

There are those few books like teachers that stay with a person they're whole life. I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am 29 years old now. It has been a long time since I was in the fifth grade. It surprises me that I still remember vividly My Side of the Mountain. What a great book. A young lad from New York City decides to run away, but not just anywhere. He heads for the Catskill Mountains. Here he lives off the land and makes his house in a burned out Redwood tree. Everyday is adventure and freedom. Every day is lived in the beautiful mountains with its scenic beauty. The boy befriends an eagle, eats wild berries, fishes the streams and creeks, and matures in the process. This book is a must for every child who has a sense of adventure, who appreciates the outdoors, and who admires wildlife. I might add that I am now a firefighter and my sense of adventure still lives. If you can't escape your city life, then live your adventure through My Side of the Mountain."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"New York City isn't the place for Sam. He's a teenager who is tired of his crowded apartment. He wants to run away and live among nature. That's exactly what Sam does. He runs away to Catskill Mountains where he would finally live by himself. He makes a home by burning out a tree and teaches himself what foods to eat, how to find them, and survive in the wilderness. He captures a young peregrine falcon and learns to train to hunt for him. This book is fascinating in its own sense.The first thing that I really liked about this book is that the journal entries in this book are written in the way that a 13-year-old teenager would write them. It seemed to me as if the book was actually written by a teenager. Sam was a teenager that simply wanted to escape, become free, and have time to himself. The other depicted this in his journals entries very well.Sam was an independent boy that wanted to grow up faster into a man. This is exactly why he went to live by himself in the mountains. He wanted to get away. I think that action alone tells a lot about Sam's character in the book. Sam had such a strong will to survive. He wanted to prove to everyone that he would do it. His actions showed that he was very intelligent as well. He made a bed of ash slats covered with deer skin and a fire place of clay and stone. He made many different things such as this to survive. He made up his whole means of fishing for food as well. Sam was an amazing boy.Sam fell in love with his falcon that he named Frightful. When Sam's parents came to visit him, they liked the falcon as well. His little sister fell so in love with Sam's new lifestyle that she too wanted to live with Sam. Sam hated this idea. After she lived with him for a couple of years he got used to the idea. He eventually liked the company.This book shows a young boy growing into a man. It gives reader a new appreciation of nature and a new outlook to man and animal companionship. This book is beyond what I expected it to be. I don't usually like nature books but this book surprised me in more than one way. People who enjoy stories of nature, characters who grow into something completely different then they were, and a book that can get your attention in more than one way, should read this book.-H. Cooper"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side Of The Mountain, written by Jean Craighead George is the best book I have ever read. It is about a boy named Sam who is tired of living in the small, crowded apartment in the heart of New York City. He decides to run away and live in the woods, but it is a little harder surviving than he expects. I chose this book because I love adventure and Jean Craighead George is an excellent author. My Side Of The Mountain has everything you want in an excellent book; great content, spell-binding moments, humor, and suspense. You never want to stop reading this book because it ends its chapters in a very critical way. I like the characters in this book because they are unusual and exciting. Every character is very different from ordinary people today. This book has such great detail that it feels like you are right beside Sam the whole way. The only thing negative about the book is that it is not very realistic. He does amazing things that are nearly impossible. He makes a house out of the inside of a tree in just a week or two and he even discovers how to make flour, sugar, and pancakes out of acorns. All and all this was a great book. It even won the Newbery Honor Award, although I think it should have won every single book award that ever existed."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"The book I read is a pretty fun book! The book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is a book where a boy runs away from the city to the mountains. He finds out how to live.Later he gets a pet falcon and names it Frightful. Soon he finds a man, but he thinks he's a bandit, then he becomes friends with the man. The boy, Sam, finds out he's a professor. He's good at making jam too.Before the winter he has Halloween with the animal friends he has made, and invites them to his house inside a tree, but it doesn't turn out well after the party.Sam kills some deer and rabbit to make clothes for the winter. He wears the rabbit's fur as underwear because it's waterproof.After the winter his parents and sister come to visit him, but they are going to live in a cabin instead of his tree house, so he gets angry but later calms down. I think the writer wants the reader to try running away. I like it because I think I would try running away in the mountains to see what happens.I highly recommend this book for both parents and kids to read."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"4 StarsOk, I am a 11 year old kid who is reading this book in class and I Love it! It is an absolute awesome book for nature lovers especially.The story is about a boy named Sam gribley who tells his father one day that he is going to run away. His father doesn't think he will succeed and do it though. He does it. The book then tells how Sam survives in his Great Grandfather's land. It tells us this by saying what foods he eats, what friends he makes, and what his shelter is. Can Sam survive winter? Can he stay alone in the woods? Read and maybe buy this book to find out!I highly recommend this book because it is a book about how you can survive in the nature and has a great main idea.Genre: I think the genre of theis book is realistic fiction and adventure because it is very adventurous and could really happen."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"A boy named Sam Gribley decided that he wanted to go live in the mountains, so he moved to the Catskill Mountains leaving his family far behind in New York City. He loved the outdoors so much that he created a house inside an Oak tree. The setting of this book is a beautiful mountain set upon a mountain chain in upstate New York during the summer months. Along the way, Sam meets wild animals including a falcon, which becomes his main companion.In My Side of the Mountain, George creates a realistic setting that I find really descriptive and interesting. The main setting of the book is in the mountains during the summer and the boy will try to make it through the harsh winter months. I have been to the mountains, and throughout the winter it can be incredibly cold and windy. All over the area where the boy made his home they're huge trees that he made his home out of. Even though it seems that the boy is out in the middle of nowhere, hikers and vacationers still come to see the view. The animals in the story are realistic. Some of the animals include a weasel, some deer, and a raccoon. The falcon, whose name is Frightful, is an amazingly trained bird in which case he never flies far from the boy. The boy took Frightful out of its nest one day and has kept him ever since.Last of all, I would recommend this book to any one out there who enjoys nature and learning the skills of survival. When I read this book I thought that is was a great book as well as exciting. I'm sure that if you read this book you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"If you're the type of person who likes survival novel books, this is the book for you!

She was so sweet and seems like she knows when Sam is sad. She always knows how to cheer him up. It may sound impossible but it is true. Frightful is so awesome.Some of my favorite scenes in the novel are when Sam and Frightful go hunting. Jean Craighead George seemed to put more description in those scenes, so I could visualize them better.

I have packed to run away many times. Not many people actually last very long though. Jean Craighead George tells the incredible story of someone who did. As the main character, Sam Gribley, struggles to face the oncoming challenges, he isn't abnormally perfect. If the character was too smart the book wouldn't be any fun. From his first scary night without fire in the wilderness, to his preparation of a many course feast for friends, you just can't put the book down. Not very many authors would think of having an animal be a chief provider of food. Tons of surprises await you at just the turn of a page. Anybody should read this book!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Wonderful, fun, exiting book!

Sam is very well described throughout the book and his surrounds are almost exact to the real thing.Sam Gribley is a city boy from New York.Sam decides that he wants to live in the mountains where they own a decrepit old farm. When he gets up there he finds many problems he has to face.If you enjoy falconry this book is for you also it has a lot of humor and descriptions of the wild.

I first read it in 4th grade. Anyway, it was a very good book for kids 8 through 15. But then I read it again, and it becamse clear that it was not likely to happen in reality.The book starts out with a boy who is held up in his tree, he is afraid that he will never get out because of the snowstorm. This was his first year in his tree, and this is how it starts.A boy leaves his house...he tells his dad he wants to runaway (this isn't the likely part, to me atleast.) He goes to the library and studies some books on forestry. To learn more you should read the book, it is very exciting, and humorous in some parts. I read this book in a few days, and you probably will too.Mark_Sigel"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Is that book you're currently reading boring to the extreme? Put it down and pick up My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George! This book is about a boy named Sam Gribley, the main character, who runs away from home to the Catskill Mountains. In the woods of the mountain, Sam makes many friends such as Bando and the Baron Weasel. Some of these people taught him how to survive while others kept him company. Will Sam ever return home?What I like about this book is the adventure included in it. I hate books if they lack adventure. I also loved how Jean Craighead George included a bit of humor in this already terrific book. If you like books with adventure and humor, this book is for you. This book is perfect for people 8 and above but specifically for kids ages 9-11. If you asked me if I would recommend this book for you, I would not hesitate in saying yes."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is a wonderful adventure story about a young teenage boy who ran away from his city-dwelling family and cramped apartment for the Catskill Mountains. Sam, the hero, is a very self-reliant, independent young man. He planned ahead, learning how to make a fire by striking flint aganst steel while still in the city. He resourcefully and bravely met every obstacle, providing himself with a good, cozy home in the rotted out heart of a great tree, finding food, tanning hides from deer lost by hunters for clothing, and even taming a falcon for companionship and hunting. The details in the book are very realistic. Jean Craighead George knows about edible wild plants and other details of outdoor survival, and writes about them convincingly. I love the way Sam uses his head and meets every challenge that comes his way. Only in the end of the book, when he has food, shelter, and even his needs for companionship are met, does his family re-enter the scene. He does not need rescuing from the wilderness, he has done a great job in not just surviving, but in making a real sustainable life for himself. What a great and empowering book! Sure to make anyone with a heart dream of running away and living in the wilderness."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I just finished My Side Of the Mountain.

Sam soon realizes it's not as easy as it looks,but learns to adjust to the life and ends up loving it! Sam had many adventures with meeting new people and making new friends. After about one year Sam's family misses him and decides to move away from the city and come live with Sam and they all end up having a great life in the woods!I really enjoyed this book. I think that Sam is a really interesting character. At first Sam is a city boy who thinks it would be cool to live in the woods, but doesn't know how hard it would be. Although Sam stood strong and learned how to survive in the wilderness and the harsh winters,I believe that Sam learned a lot from living in the woods because he learned that if he really tries something and doesn't give up he can really accomplish his goal, which is living in the mountains without any experience at all and I really admire Sam for that.I really enjoyed reading this book and researching about Jean George and finding out what she is like and maybe why she wrote a book like this. Although I did wonder why Sam's parents weren't in that much of a panic when Sam ran away. Though I found out that Sam's dad was betting that Sam would come back some time and realize that he couldn't really survive in the woods alone.Jan a 6th grader"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"1) My Side of the Mountain2) Jean Graighead George3) My Side of the Mountain is about a boy named Sam Gribley who comes from a large family in New York. Sam ran away from home because he had eleven people in his family, and they all had to squeeze into a small apartment. Sam felt that he had no privacy and wanted to run away to Gribley's Farm, which was once owned by his great-grandfather. It is now a forest, and he plans to live off the land for a while. He took only what he had in his pockets, and hitched a ride to Gribley's Farm.When he got to the forest, he wandered around a bit and tried to find shelter. He saw a big tree, and he thought maybe he could live inside if he hollowed out the tree by burning it out. Since he read a lot of nature and outdoors magazines and gone to the library, he knew how to survive. After Sam made his tree room, he lit a fire, and went to sleep. For food, he gathered berries and nuts. He then learned how to hunt. One day, while he was hunting, he spotted a nest up in a tree with three baby falcons. Sam took one, and decided to raise it. He named the bird Frightful. Frightful learned to fly, hunt, and come to Sam when he was whistled. For weeks, Sam trained Frightful. Slowly he outgrew his city clothes, and had to make new ones. He caught some deer, and used the hide for clothes. One day, while Sam was inside his tree, he heard a person walking near his \\"home.\\" This is how he met Bando, and English teacher at a school. They became good friends. Bando had to leave, but he would come back and visit every so often, and with him he would bring some sugar and jam. For Christmas, Sam was happy to see his father. They had a feast, and Sam's dad met Bando. Sadly, his dad had to leave after Christmas. Another person he met was Matt, a young reporter who was following the \\"Wild Boy\\" story. Matt uncovered Sam's identity and Sam begged him not to report him. Matt said, yes, as long as he could spend his spring vacation with Sam in his tree. Matt left to go back to school and came back on his vacation. One more person he met was a hiker named Aaron. They became quick friends, sang songs, and then Aaron had to leave. After a couple weeks of spring, his dad came, only this time with the whole family! They all hug, and talk for a while. Finally, his father said they were going to build a house in the forest next to Sam's tree, so they could all be together.4) The main character in the book is Sam Gribley, a 12 year-old boy. Sam has dark brown hair, black eyes, and wears a nice-looking deerskin suit that he made himself. He is ruddy, and is in perfect health. Sam has a positive attitude towards everything, and his spirits never go down.5) The setting takes place on Gribley's Farm, which is now a forest, located in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Sam's home is in a hollowed-out tree that is six feet in diameter. As you enter the tree, there is a bed on the right, and on the left is a small fireplace about knee high. It is made out of clay and stones. Around the tree, there are three little knotholes to let out the smoke. It is a snug little cave.6) The internal conflict is Sam always wondering, \\"Do I want to be found?\\" Also, Sam always has to think positively or he won't survive. The external conflict is Sam having to gather food and hunt. He also has to deal with daily hikers and seasonal hunters.7) My favorite part was when Sam was making his tree home, because he is so resourceful, and has many cool ideas. Also, it's cool when Sam trains Frightful, because it is a wild falcon. It is quite an accomplishment to train a wild bird.8) What I like least about the book was that it was so unrealistic. An example would be that after a couple of months with Sam gone, his father didn't report him missing. Also, Sam could always do everything right in the forest, and it never seemed like his life was even a little hard. The ending was somewhat disappointing because his family came and plunked a house on the land."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I think that people who love exciting stories or stories that make your heart pound five times faster should read this book. Jean Craighead George's book circles around Sam Gribley, a boy who is tired of the city life. Sam leaves his home to go where his grandfather once lived. On his way he meets his new companion for life and deals with challenges that he never had to face in the city. This book earns a five star rating because it is mind-boggling and mysterious as well as daunting and delightful."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"It's kind of Walden for kids, as a young boy sets out to live in the wilderness and simplify his life by enjoying nature and escaping civilization.

It's a fun book to read and you learn a bit about nature, but the way the book is written, some of the characters, and the unbelievable elements of the book detract from the overall reading experience. Sam's friends are pretty gay, and there's no way any parents would let their son run away. I find it hard to believe that he survives the winter all alone in the mountains. Sam is a pretty thin character. In this book, they all are. I think it's gay how Sam names all the animals. This book is worth reading. It's entertaining, and fun to reread. Give it a try, just don't expect too much. I've read the sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain. Parts of it are good, but it's a strange story. Not very engrossing.

My review is for the Narrator, Christian Rummel. I am spoiled because I first listened to this narrated by Jeff Woodman, and to me, he is Sam Gribley. His rendition is so excellent, it cannot be improved upon in my opinion. Rummel sounds wooden, like he is reading it and has some mispronunciations that are annoying. The main character, Sam, goes to Delhi (Dell-Hi) but the narrator says Deli (like where you go to get a sandwich or the city in India). This and a couple of smaller ones just add to the dislike of the narrator. I don't know why they felt they had to re-record it with someone else. Do yourself a favor and find an older CD with Jeff Woodman as the narrator. You won't be sorry. We found it at our local library. This site has an audiobook excerpt read by Woodman [....]"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My SIDE of the MOUNTAINby Jean Craighead GeorgeDid you read this novel as a kid? Is a copy collecting dust on your bookshelf? Well, get it down and give it a fresh read, you'll be blown away how timeless this tale is. And fun too.Who doesn't dream of running away--imagine no husband or wife to nag you, so long to the kids and hand over your cell phone!\\"I am on my mountain in a tree home that people have passed without ever knowing that I am here. The house is a hemlock tree six feet in diameter, and must be as old as the mountain itself.\\"So begins Sam Gribley's pretty amazing adventure on his great-grandfather's land in the Catskill Mountains. From foraging in the wild to stealing a baby falcon and raising it to hunt for him, Sam's life unfolds into a modern day Thoreau with a dash of Swiss Family Robinson. He explains that living in a cramped New York apartment with an enormous family literally drove him to run away, but how his parents could have let a boy of only 14 live for nearly 9 months in a tree did have me wondering.Tossing parental concerns aside and realizing this story was written in 1959, there's so much to appreciate and the amount of wildlife knowledge, thanks to a local library Sam often visits, is actually very useful.\\"I would bake the acorns in the fire, and grind them between stones. This was tedious work too, but now that I had a home and smoked venison and did not have to hunt food every minute, I could do things like make flour.\\"One of the many moral lessons the author weaves into her story is that no matter where you run and attempt to hide; the world is right there watching--even before all the crazy technology was at the ready. Sam does learn early on that living on your own can be a lonely affair and so, of course, several different characters literally wander into his life.My only beef with this adventure-filled story is that the ending seemed rather abrupt. I won't spoil it for you since I know everyone is going to read this, but it really felt dropped in like a, well, like a dive-bombing falcon. BAM--end of story. But I know different, and perhaps you do too, there's a sequel and a movie and...The best part about MSOTM is that for a short time you can once again be that boy who not only had a dream, but made it happen and guess what?Like Sam Gribley, maybe you'll be inspired to stop dreaming and start living the dream!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I've suddenly realized why I love so much the survival shows on discovery and the science channel..Bear Grylls, Dual Survival, Survivor Man, etc. And there was even a documentary on PBS about a guy who went up into Alaska and built his own log cabin and lived on his own for 20-30 years...loved that as well. Anyways, this book was read to me by one of my grade school teachers and I ended up getting it from the library and reading it again myself within the next year or so. I loved it. Loved the idea of making a very modest home in a tree, getting by and living off the land. The solitude, the simplicity. But as years went by, I grew up, and the story was pushed into the back of my mind. Over the last many years, I've found I absolutely love all those before mentioned survival shows and the other night, this book popped back into my head and it all came together for me. It all started with My Side of the Mountain. I strongly recommend this book to young kids, or even to adults. Read it to your kids. So many are locked up in video games and garbage on TV that they don't get outside and live and make their own little adventures ( but I don't advocate running away!)."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is one of the first items I have orderded from Amazon and I am impressed!

The books in the series are: My Side of the Mountain, On the Far Side of the Mountain, and Frightful's Mountain. The main character, Sam, is a young boy who ran away from his New Your city home to his great-grandfather's farm called the \\"Gribley's Farm.\\" He lived off the land, and built himself a home, by burning out a hemlock tree. Nobody thought he could do it. These people were in for a surprise. As years go by Sam makes friends, while he works hard, and having adventures.In the book, My Side of the Mountain, when Sam was at home in New York he went to school, and lived in a small house. He was tired of New York City life and so he decided to run away to his great-grandfather's abandoned farm in the Catskill Mountains. On the way to the farm, he stopped to ask directions at a library. There he met Ms. Turner, the librarian. After a bit of searching she found a map. She gave him the map, wished him well, and he was on his way back to his adventure. When Sam arrived to the farm, he was hungry. After a while, he put himself to work on hollowing out a tree for a home. After building his home, he made household appliances such as a stove. One day, Sam met an old woman named Mrs. Strawberry who thought he lived in Delhi. They walked down the mountain until suddenly, Sam decided to go the library. There he read books on hawks and falcons. After he thought he had learned enough he left the library. On his way back up the mountain, he headed towards the cliffs. When he arrived there he saw a falcon's nest. He wanted a falcon so badly he started to climb up the cliff. When he came down his shoulder was hurt, and in his hands, he had a baby falcon, who he named Frightful. As he walked back to Gribley farm, he watched the little eyas, and fell in love. After many years of love and comfort, what happened?In the second book of the series, On the Far Side of the Mountain, Sam now took care of his little sister Alice. His parents found him and decided to stay, but when they found the land was impossible to farm they were going to leave. The whole family was going to leave even Sam, but Sam had other ideas and so did his sister Alice. Therefore, his little sister Alice asked if she could stay with Sam and their parents thought about it and said yes. After a half a year Sam's bird, Frightful was \\"confiscated\\" by a conservation officer because it was an endangered species. After a great sadness, he decided to take a walk. When he came back, Alice was gone. Because he loved Alice so much, he followed her. On his adventure to find her, he discovered poachers had stolen Frightful from him. Did he ever find Frightful and did her ever catch up to Alice?In the third book of the series, Frightful's Mountain, Frightful found a mate and had eyases in a nest on a bridge. After a while, construction workers started to repair the bridge. As their bulldozers raised a ruckus, Sam comforted Frightful. When conservation officers saw the problem, they tried to help. After their attempt failed, they tried to get the workers to stop. When the poachers saw the opportunity, they dressed up as Fish and Wildlife Officers. They told the workers they were there to save the eyases so the workers helped them. When the falcon \\"conservation officers\\" thought were all the eyases were down, they drove off. However, one of the eyases was still there, so Frightful stayed. When Sam saw this, he moved Frightful's eyas, and Frightful followed. When he found out poachers had taken two of the eyases he set out to find them. Did he ever find the eyases and did Frightful ever see them again?I am sure you will like this unpredictable series. Jean George's ability to imagine makes the story intriguing. This makes for a great series."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My side of the mountain is an exciting book about a young boy named Sam Gribley.

While Sam is living in the hills he has many visitors that come and find out about him, and there are hunters in the hills that go home and tell the media that there is a boy in the hills that is stealing there deer. With all of these events happening he starts to get more media attention, and people trying to find him, including his family. I encourage this book for all ages of readers who are seeking an adventure."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I can recall my fourth grade teacher reading this book to our class. We all loved it! I was especially drawn to the idea of a boy running away from home and the family that didn't understand to live in the mountains of upstate New York. He hollows out a large tree and makes a house out of it, with a deerskin for a door. Now, as an elementary education major, we read a lot of children's literature and do the same projects we would have our students do. I was just as excited to revisit this classic at 21 as I was at 11.Sam Gribley moves out to the country to live off the land. He has ideals and is a true naturist. However, he cannot escape being noticed. He gets lonely and befriends badgers, raccoons and even a baby falcon that he trains to catch food for him. An occasional run-in with humans is inevitable though. There comes a point when Sam is unable to live alone anymore and begins to crave human attention once again.This is a good book about survival in the woods, and the pressures that every young-adolescent will go through. The discussion starter questions are endless. The big drawback for me was the ending, which I will not reveal you to now. Still, it is worth reading even though you may be a let down in the last 2 pages.Why 4 stars?: While I do feel it is a good book that deserves a place in every intermediate classroom library, there are a few drawbacks. The book is a little bit dated and the end is frustrating. However, it is entertaining and appeals to the sense of adventure and mischief that is found in all of us."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I just re-read this book for the first time since childhood as a project for a Children's Literature class and the things that made me love this book as a child came leaping off the pages to meet me. George inserts visual and humorous quirks into the animals who share Sam's home with him, without injecting them with the unrealistic ability to speak. These animals speak volumes in their actions and habits.This book does contain some curious themes for children, such as a boy running away from home, several adult characters who know that Sam has run away but just decide to help him hide, and a father who comes to see his son just before the onset of winter in the Catskills, but doesn't force him to come home with him.However, George's intricate details (recipes, drawings, etc..) and varying narration (slipping between diary form to storytelling) add a realism that can't help but spark the imagination and feed that part of a little boy's soul that yearns for independence and self-sufficience.A great book for children who don't necessarily like to read. What's cooler than a falcon for a pet? Nothing."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book was awesome! Sam did what every kid wishes they could do. He ran away and lived in the woods. He got a pet and made some friends, including a weasel and a racoon. Sam Gribbly is the hero of most american kids. I recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate a good book."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My mother started to read this book to me at bedtime when I was a kid, but I loved it so much that I ended upreading it to myself under the covers.I can't wait to read it to my son, because the book embodies so many good traits I want to pass to my son. Self reliance, care for the world around you, living delibratly, are all personified in Sam, the main character. He leaves his urban home and family and survives in the wilderness off his own wits and some fishing line. Sam's experiences are riviting, both because his many encounters with nature are scary (realistic) and triumphal.Plus who doesn't want a trained Falcon?Read this to your kids,with your kids, or for yourself, you will feel better about the world."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Not an on the edge of your seat book, but wonderfully keeps your attention. The ending could have been rounded a little easier. It was very fun to see what happened. I will read it again soon. Most Puffin books you can trust to be good."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is about a 14 year-old boy (Sam Gribley) who runs away from his enormous family (one of eleven siblings) in New York City in 1959 seeking privacy. Sam hitches a ride to his great -grandfather's land in the Catskill Mountains where he sets up a \\"hemlock\\" type structure in a fallen hollow tree. Sam then uses conventional fishing methods as food for his first few weeks. As he learns the \\"way of the forest\\", Sam begins to take advantage of what the wilderness has to offer. For instance, he makes flour out of acorns and dinnerware out of empty turtle shells. As Sam continues making new observations and friends (\\"Jessie S. James\\" . . . a badger and \\"Frightful\\" . . . a falcon), he also becomes regular friends with two people, Aaron and Bando, who often visit Sam in his secluded mountain. As time passes, Sam's parents find out about Sam's location in the forest. Around Christmastime, Sam's dad visits him. He is quite impressed with Sam's hemlock, diet, and his interactions with the surrounding wildlife. Sam's father leaves within a few days, satisfied with Sam's condition. As hunters begin to raid the area for deer hunting season, many hunters report seeing a \\"wild boy dressed in deerskin from head to toe\\". Suspicions of a wild boy continue, until one reporter tracks down Sam. After a year of living in the mountains, Sam is cajoled to tell the truth about the fourteenth year of his life to both his family and the public.One positive aspect of character development is at the beginning of the novel, Jean portrays Sam as a scared and hopeless boy. But by the end of the book, we see Sam as fearless and wise. Secondly, the main reason why Sam left his family was to search for privacy. However, by the end of the story, he realizes that there is no full privacy to be found in New York State. The reason why this story did not receive 1st Place is one flaw in the character's development of Sam. Although this novel has been used as a wilderness reference guide, Jean Craighead George does not adequately indicate how Sam, a 14 year-old city boy, obtains such outdoor skills. For example, once Sam killed a deer, page 65 states, \\"The rest of June was spent smoking it, tanning it, and finally, starting on my deerskin suit.\\" How does Sam know how to do these things? The book only addresses this issue as Sam using his \\"ingenuity\\"."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"wow! this was an awesome book! i like it so much! the idea of a young kid running away is amazing!

I did not really like the end where his family moved up to the Catskills and we did not get to know whether their house was built or if they just lived in the trees like Sam.I think Jean should right another book about Sam's whole family living on the mountain.I liked the rest of the book anyways.Compared to the movie I think you should read the book.

He wasn't content about his life there. So Sam decided to run away to Catskill Mountains where he can be left alone. Sam had few things equipped on him. He survived on his own on the lonely mountain. Ever since he felt that it was hard being alone, he came back to New York and moved some where else. Now Sam had his problems solved.This book was great! I like the story. The author writes many stories about survival, and I like these survival stories. The author made a similar book like this called Julie of the Wolves. This author also gives descriptive writings about her characters. She develops a character who survives and makes friends with animals. Sam wanted to take care of himself and liked his life better in Catskill. \\"I made a fire on a flast boulder in the stream, and cooked the trout,\\" this explains that he took care of himself.This book also shows illustrations of how Sam survived and what he did. The author wrote \\"It was so cold I yelled,\\" by this quote you can tell that Sam was getting tired of his life on Catskill Mountains. When I read this, it made me feel like I was Sam. It was strange, but that's how I felt. I kind of dislike the setting of the wilderness, but I liked the story. It seems that the author wrote this as if it was what happened to the author.My favorite part of the book was when Sam ran away. This was my favorite part because it was adventurous from then. I like the genre of the book. Every page I read it gets more exciting. I also liked the part when Sam went out of the mountain. I liked it because he'd probably learned a lesson that it's hard living a life by his self."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am in fourth grade. I read My Side of the Mountain as an assignment for home school. I really liked the book. I would read it again. I liked how Sam could live off the land and make food out of the plants and animals.

You should read this book because it has lots of adventures and fun in it."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"THe love of the wild is on evey page and perfect for young readers.

There are some surprising turns throughout the book that keep it exciting. Some parts were corny but others were thrilling.

It is a good book I give it **** stars."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"The book showed how life can be challenging if you make it challenging and it shows how wonderful peace is when you have been alone for a long long time. I think the writer's point in the story is that all of us have a skill and we need to runaway and find out what our skill is. Everyone is afraid of industrial things taking over the world's air and ground and this book makes people feel in the woods with nothing but your sane mind and a few things. This book helps you understand nature and its difficulties. This makes you more attached to nature."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My side of the Mountain was very interesting, and it kept my attention until the end. This book was interesting because everything seemed real. It didn\`t dragg on and on and went right to the story. I do think that the boy in the story was a lot older than you would think he was.The book is about a boy named Sam Gribley that is terribly unhappy and living in New York City with his family. He runs away to the Catskilled Moutains to live by himself with only a penknife, a ball of cord, forty dollars, flint and steel which he plans to use to help him survive. Sam learns about courage, danger, and independence during his year in the wilderness; a year that changes his life forever.This book is good and if you like adventures this is the book for you. This book has also won the Newbery Honor Award. This book is a classic story of wilderness survival. It also should appeal to all rugged individualists who dream of escaping to the forest. (great book)"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is about a boy named Sam Gribley. Sam runs away from his home in New York City. He wants to dwell by himself in the Catskill Mountains. He makes himself a house in a hemlock tree. Frightful the peregrine falcon he stole, to help him get food. Sam's father and his companion Bando come for Christmas. They have a wonderful time.My Side of the Mountain is exiting and adventurous. Sam notifies his dad he is running away. He goes to the Catskill Mountains and steals a whole dear from hunters. He has a lot of nerve to live by himself for a year.I think the message that the author is trying to share is \\"Some things don't happen, but not like you want them to.\\" When Sam was making himself his house he lit a fire to burn out the inside of a tree. The fire warden came and put the fire out when Sam wanted it to keep burning. This book by Jean Craighead George was great! I give the book Five Stars!!!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am on my third reading of My Side of the Mountain (first as a fifth grader, then with my first son, and now with my second son) and I'm enjoying it as much as the first time. In fact, I might be enjoying it a little more. Although we live on the dividing line between the city and \\"the county,\\" we're really urban dwellers. This book excited my Playstation/basketball playing semi-urban kids about nature. They looked at hikes and scouts in a new way. In fact, what was most frightening about the book was the time spent alone.I highly recommend this as a reader, parent and teacher. In fact, I've used passages with my college ESL classes and they've gone on to buy the book and read the whole thing!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I liked My side Of the Mountain.

I liked how it got sad exciting and had mischief."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"In the Newbery Honor Book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George, it tells how to survive in the woods. The story starts with a boy named Sam Gribley, who runs away from his home to fulfill his destiny: to find his great-grandfather's old farm. With only a penknife, ball of cord, ax, forty dollars, and flint and steel, he survives many harsh months in the woods. Later in the book, he gets a companion that is a falcon named Frightful. Finally in the book he finds his great-grandfather's barn. The environment is a total change to him. It is comparing a crammed apartment in New York to the immense wilderness of the Catskill Mountains. Although he was mostly inept due to the circumstances, he still survived.There are three reasons why I enjoy reading this book. First of all, it taught about wilderness survival and had many adventurous missions. Second of all, the author described the book so well that it felt as if you were in the book. Lastly, it showed later on when Sam showed kindness to a visitor by giving him shelter in his tree house and giving him some food. The only reason why I don't like this book is because it talks about him running away from home and it encourages the younger aged audience to run away from home like Sam. I think the book should be read from the ages 8-12. I really enjoy reading this book and would encourage you to read it.-Chris"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I am 53 and read this book when I was very young.

When I read this book I did realize that we were reading it because it was to get boys interested in reading. Also I thougt to myself I might be a bit prejuidiced against this book because I had a much higher reading level than anyone else in my class and I had just finished reading the Lord of the Rings and not a lot of books can compare to that one. Bearing this in mind I read tihs book trying not to be to down about it. My positive thoughts failed. It was horrible the plot was stupid, I mean yes after reading one book Sam can skin an animal and make a coat. In case you didn't notice I was being sarcastic. But then this is from the sarcastic class brain I thought it's just me being my usual cheery self.

The Giver, The Sign of the Beaver, The Awakening, Call It Courage, Holes, Bud Not Buddy, Amos Fortune:Free Man, Bridge to Terabithia, Charlotte's Web, Number the Stars, Dear Mr. Henshaw, The Golden Goblet, and A Single Shard.

He runs away from his home in New York City and goes to live in the Catskill Mountains. Sam is nice, brave, friendly, and adventurous. I would love to have him as a friend. He was brave when he stole a falcon from its nest for a pet. Sam made a house by burning the inside of a huge rotten tree. He whittled a hook out birch bark to catch fish. It worked! He had a friend, a college professor, who'd live with him during parts of the summer and during his school vacations. This friend would bring Sam newspaper articles about the \\"Wild Boy\\" of the Catskills. Sam ate nuts, meats, and berries in the woods. He made a lot of weird food out of the things that he thought tasted terrific. I enjoyed this book because it had nature and adventure."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"It starts out slow, but it gets very good when you get into it. It's a great book for independent readers. I devoured it quickly. I know you'll love it too. It's about a boy who runs away into the forest because he is tired of the city and wants something more. This story shows many excellent scenes of survival. Sam must train a falcon to help him catch food. He hollows out a tree to live in and cook his own food! Talk about camping! He leaves his home with only a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, $40 and some flint and steel, and top it of with high spirits. The survival in this story is amazing! No survival story could be better. Sam has to make a fireplace out of clay and he has to rely on the powers of Mother Earth to keep him alive. This story is fascinating and to all independent people it is more."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book reveals that despite the illusions of &quot;civilization&quot; that we weave, deep down each one of us little more than a blood thirsty beast. As young Sam Gribley journeys ever deeper into the Catskills, he is slowly stripped of his humanity, eventually becoming one with the cunning, craving creatures of no morals which inhabit the forest. Not a tale for the weak of mind... or of stomach."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This boy named Sam ,ran away from home. Sam is a very smart person.

Along the way Sam has a few unexpected visitors and makes a few animal friends. He grows to really like a bird that he found that he names Frightful.

When he was living in the Mountains he learned courage, bravery, and independence that will change his life forever.I think that the book is a good book for kids.

Well that's what Sam Gribly, the protagonist, in My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George had to do. Sam left home hoping to complete his journey of living off the land for one year.When hunting season came Sam had to be extra careful not to be seen by the hunters on the mountain. One time Sam underhandedly stole a deer. He claimed the hunter could not find it. One day a bullet came speeding past his head, like a fastball passing over home plate.Sam's father came to visit him and Bando the schoolhouse teacher. When he arrived, there was a feast waiting there for him. They ate salmon and steak for dinner. After they were done eating they would play flutes made of wood under the star filled ebony sky. Once Bando left, Sam and his Dad were finally alone. Sam's father became frail because of all the extra work that was needed to survive in the harsh cold weather.Living off the land is like living without your parents because your parents always make food for you and they also buy you warm clothes when the weather turns cold. Sam had to do all of this for himself. Sam was living off the land in a tree. He was living so well that his whole family came to see him. While they were there his family found it a very nice place to live. They decided to make their own place in the woods to call home. Sam's mother decided to build a log cabin. If I were Sam, I would have rather stayed in the tree dome.My Side of the Mountain is a great book full of adventure in every chapter, and I recommend it to readers who love the outdoors and observing nature in its finest. It is one of my favorites. But you'll have to read it yourself to experience Sam's many adventures."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Have you ever wanted to live on a gigantic mountain? If you have you should read the book My Side Of The Mountain, a novel by Jean Craighead George about a boy who moved to his grandfather's mountain. Sam, the protagonist, moves to his grandfather's mountain because he was sick of New York. My favorite event was when Sam gets stuck in the biggest storm. I thought it was the best because I have got stuck in a huge storm before, too. It was the first blizzard in the mountain and Sam was stuck inside a huge tree, his home.Another event that happens was when his bird, Frightful, gets him food. I thought it was unique because not many birds get food for their owners or even people. If I had a bird like that, I would not have to eat salads, and I would not have to pay for it. I think he named it Frightful because he was afraid of the lightning when they experienced that huge storm.So if you want to find out if Sam moves out of the woods or stays, I think you should read and enjoy this book because it is the best!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My opinion of the book was that it was okay. It wasn't the best, but it was pretty interesting because Sam just decited that he was going to run away and live in the Catskill Mountains to find his Great-Grandfather Gribley's farm. His parents had no problem with it because they thought he was going to come back home just like Sam's father did when he was his age. If I was in the position of his parents I would't let him go. It was also interesting how he made his treehouse, got his food, how he cooked it, preserved it, and lived in the willderness with the company of Frightful, the Baron, the other animals, and rarely seeing a human being. It took a lot of braveness and courage. I could never do what he did."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"my side of the mountain is a good story. it would not be a good story for teens. it would be a good book for younger kids to read.the story is very touching tail. this one little boy runs away from home and tries to survive and eat. he even stole a falcon, a pergren falcon, and trained it to catch food for him."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"A summery of the Newbury honors wining book my side of the mountain, by Jean Creighead George. I found this book to be a very venturous as well as entertaining. The main character of this book is a boy by the name of Sam Gribley, he is a boy who is tired of living at home in crowded New York City. This is where the story begins, Brian runs away from home to the Catskill Mountains to live off of the land. He begins with only a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, forty dollars, and some flint and steal. He must rely on his integrity and knowledge of the land to survive the many adventures. I especially like this book because I find my self to be an outdoorsman in a few ways, so if you like the outdoors and adventure you should read this book. Not to forget it has a few illustrations on traps and various other survival tactics."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My 10-year-old son is a reluctant reader, and it was tough getting him to try My Side of the Mountain, but once he started, he couldn't put it down.I read it after him and I loved it too. It has everything, adventure, nature lore and survival tips, as well as insight into the human spirit.Unfortunately, the sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, came up short. My son started, it but quickly lost interest and never finished the book. His primary complaint was Sam's sister being inserted into the plot."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I read this for the first time 14 years ago and loved it so much that as a result I kept the elemetary school's wild food cookbook constantly checked out for my last three years there. Over time as I turned to Sci-fi and fantasy novels (many of which ironically have to deal with herbalists) I sort of forgot about it until I rediscovered it last week. I was in the last art Book Arts class before exams and I was discussing the idea behind my exam project which focuses on rosemary. After some discussion I realized that my love of herbs, and essentially mountain life in general, stems from the first time I read My Side of the Mountain. Directly after that class, I drove to the local book store, picked up a copy and readit cover to cover. Like others have said, this is indeed a fantastic book that stays with you. I highly recommend it for \\"children\\" of all ages, if they are enchanted with the concept of grinding their own acorn flour, all the better."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This was a lovely story that will be loved by pre teens as I am sure most of them would love to be free of their parents and living comfortably with nature. Also, the very interesting facts about how to survive by living off the land would be quite exciting for a child to learn - I was intrigued by some of the things that he could eat and use.However, I struggled with the story as there were a few facts that I could just not get over. First was that if your 17 year old had run away, surely, you would be sending out search parties to look for him and bring him home, particularly if you actually knew where he had gone. I don't think any mother would just leave their child to live in the wilderness for many months without intervening. Second, how did Sam know all the things he knew about living in nature. Even the best read teenager would struggle to have all the knowledge that Sam had to survive in the wilderness. Ok it was written in 1959 a time when there were no video games, computers and tv to distract a child from reading books but still, it just was not believable to me. Lastly, and again this might be a sign of the times, but I thought the character of Bando was just creepy as what College Professor would leave a child alone in the woods to survive and then come and stay over alone with him in a tree on several occasions. I just don't think that he would have done this but the times were different in 1959!So if you can get your head around these three main faults then it is a lovely little story, reminiscent of Enid Blyton for a slightly older audience in some ways. Perhaps get your pre teen to read and let me know their opinion.It is one book from a trilogy and I may be tempted to read the next two just to see where it all leads - not a huge effort as they are only a couple of hundred pages each.So 3 out of 5 from me."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I liked the book but I didn't like that he had to live in a house with his family again at the end.

I wish i can live like him in the wilderness with a falcon"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"A True Adventure storyThe book, My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George, takes a powerful look at surviving in the wilderness by you once was taking a hike e in the wilderness with my family and it was really interesting. It was fascinating because there were no roads, just trees and hills and aniamals, but I cannot imagine spending a year in the wilderness. In this story, a boy named Sam ran away from home at 12 years old and went to the Catskill Mountains. He survived by living in a large tree. He wore animal furs, ate wild berries and roots, and trained his pet falcon to hunt birds and rabbits for food. I recommend this book to adventurous people who want to learn how to service in the wilderness.Throughout the book, we learn more about the main character and his life in the Canadian wilderness by himself. Sam left his parents because he wanted to build a life based on his own principles. During the year, he proves many things, primarily to himself, but also to his parents and others he met. Normally ,an adult would question weather a 12 year old boy could survive in the wilderness with only his pen knife,forty dallars , a ball of cord and natural resources, plus his own inteligence. The most important things that he learned were how to find food, shelter and clothing. He learned how to depend on himself, but even though he was successful in providing for himself, still he needed people and companionship. For instance. He captures a baby falcon, which catches food for him and becomes his best friend. Throughout the story. He meets a few strangers while in the wilderness, and he slowly realizes that he needs people not to service, but to socialize and share ideas with. This feeling of loneliness is one of the main reasons he decides to go back home after a year.Unlike other servitor books such as Gary Pulsons stories, this auther tells what the boy is feeling while he is living on his own. Some of his feeling are fear, depression, being courageous and the important of being true to yourself. Even though this book was written about 45 years ago, it teaches you useful ideas for living on the land without modern conveniences. For instance, Sam learned how to start a fire without matches, to catch fish with an old fationed line and hook, to tap a tree for fresh maple syrup, to make snowshoes to travel in the snow and even grew his own alga and acorns for pancake flour. Being able to finder own food and clothing in the wilderness is important if you are lost in the forest or if you are camping,The pace of this story is very fast and is vivid in the account of Sam's life. This book kept me very engrossed as Sam deals with being alone in the mountains and carrying out his mission. I hope that you have learned some of the important things you need in order to service on your own and are impressed with the competency of the main character to pick up a copy, or at least watch the video which you can get at your public library."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I would reccomend \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" to my friends because it is a great story about a boy living off nature in the Catskill Mountains."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I found this book very exciting with many helpful tips.

At the time, it captured my imagination, and I spent hours pretending that I lived in a tree trunk (a small closet worked quite nicely), and marveled at the ingenuity of the protagonist in surviving on the land and taming a falcon.There is an innocence to the tale that just doesn't exist in life or fiction anymore. A strange man arriving on the mountain would be more suspicious and perhaps dangerous today than it was when the book was written. Yet, there is a timeless quality to the book, owing in part to the fact that the story makes no references to any topical issues.I have bought this book several times to give to children in my family as they hit 6th grade or so, and without exception both boys and girls identify with the story and the desire to escape from a world controlled by adults. I hope the kids in your life will find the story as entertaining and memorable as I did."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I thought this book was ok case it gives a lot of information.

This book traveled with me in my backpack like a survival guide. I had to tape the binding because I wore it out. I made the snares and looked for nuts and berries and all that good stuff. I can truthfully say this single book molded a part of me that is still with me today. Encourage your child to read it. After the first few pages they will be hooked.

This book forced me to wonder the possibilities and desire new freedoms and challenges in my life, and it certainly sparked my greater interest in nature, both the wild moments and the calm moments of nature. My Side of the Mountain is a book telling a story of a young boy named Sam Gribley whom decides to leave his parents and his family's apartment in New York City, with their permission, and to move into the Catskill Mountains nearby and learns to survive winters, hunger, animals, and other such things using library books and his own instincts and experiences in the forest. He meets a mysterious man named Bando, and befriends him, yet they do not meet daily. He eventually kidnaps a baby peregrine falcon that he names Frightful, and eventually trains to capture small animals for food, and she becomes his best friend on his side of the mountain. The book is 177 pages long and is written as a journal, limiting dialogue, not to mention there is hardly any dialogue for the most part due to isolated. There are several flashbacks in the story and may be rather confusing to understand, yet it is simple to get up to speed in the plot in case you ever get lost in the words or order of things."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Excellent tale of a young man who wanted to see life through different eyes and becomes best friends with all sorts of wildlife and grows up in the process."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Sam Gribley is an independent boy who is growing into a man.

It is about this eleven year old boy named Sam Gribley. He is just sick and tired about living in his very crowded apartment building. He decides to run away to the Catskill Mountains to find his great-grandfathers land marked by the word \\"GRIBLEY\\" carved in to a tree. I just thought it was so intriguing to read about his strong will to survive and prove to everyone that yes, he can do it.In the book he lives in a hallowed out hemlock tree that he burned out himself it was about six feet in diameter. He mad a bed of ash slats covered with deer skin and a fire place of clay and stone. He used notches in an aspen poll as a calendar. He eats nuts and berries and things made with acorn flour. For fishing he whittled a strong stick with a sharp point on one end and an angled cut at the other then took another strong stick and cut and angled end on it too. He tied both angled ends together with tree bark and had him self a fishing hook.This book is only one of three and if you like it I highly recommend reading the others.

This book is great for anyone who likes camping or the wilderness. The main plot is about a boy named Sam Gribley who runs away from the city of New York to the wilderness of the Cat Skill Mountains. He makes many new animal friends who have traits and characteristics of people he knew back home. He also makes human friends like the English teacher Bando. He lives in a hollowed out hemlock tree, for almost a year! Now Sam must live off the land in order to survive.A really interesting part is when he steals a young peregrine falcon chick and trains it to hunt for him. Some other strange things in this book are things Sam eats such as acorn pancakes, or wild onions. He also eats turtles, trout and crayfish. This book was so good I was very sorry that it ended.

In my case the animal companions were also a must, and I would have loved a falcon of my own. I also used Sam's descriptions of how he made his home in the woods as inspiration when I made forts in the back yard.

To my surprise, I have a greater admiration for Sam and his decision to runaway and live in the Catskills Mountains now than I did when I was 11. I think that few adults would have the audacity to leave the conforts of home and live off of their wits. The thought of failure would be enough to put them off. This book left me with an immense sense of liberation and adventure. It will not be another 21 odd years before I read this little treasure again."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Wild Boy!Have you ever imagined running away to live off your grand fathers land when you were only 14? Well that is what happens in this book, My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. This book is FULL with excitement on every page. It is about a boy named Sam who runs away and goes to live off his grand fathers land. There are 184 pages in this book.Sam, who is fourteen, wants to go live up on the Catskills to his grandfather's land. When Sam got to his grand fathers land he built a home in a tree. Sam meets Bando he is a school teacher in New York. Bando was lost one day and fell asleep at Sam's camp. Bando stayed with Sam for a few days and said he would come back for Christmas. One day Sam found some rock and made fire in his tree. The fire helped because winter was coming and it was very cold. It was hunting season and Sam was worried. One day Sam was walking around and saw one hunter kill three doe. Sam ran to the doe and carried them over to a bush and hid. After the hunters passed Sam took the three doe to his tree. If I tell you what the ending is it will ruin the whole book.My favorite part of the book is when Sam climbs a mountain and finds three baby falcons. Sam takes one. But when Sam takes one the mother falcon gets mad and claws Sam in the shoulder. Sam falls down the mountain and gets injured. He trains the falcon and names it frightful. Frightful is very smart and has good eye site.The most important thing I learned from reading this book is that you can always trust someone you know.Some similar books are Canyon Winter, Hatchet, Kavik the Wolf Dog, and Brian's Winter which is the sequel to Hatchet.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books.My star rating is five stars"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is a truly great book.Everyone wants a chance to run away and take care of themselves in the forest through winter and worry their parents and everything but this is the story of someone who really stayed for a long time.

One is a love of reading and the second is a love of nature. What better way to do that than great stories about children making it on their own in the wild? Books about survival in nature are great because they inspire kids' imagination, while encouraging them to learn more.Like Ronia the Robber's Daughter and Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain is another great book about a kid living off of the land. Published in 1959 and the recipient of a Newberry Honor, this book has a timeless quality that holds up 50 years later. It is ranked as a 6th grade reading level, but will appeal to strong younger readers as well. It is not a fast paced adventure, but it is interesting with lots of detail about animal, seasons and nature. For example, Sam manages to capture and train a falcon to help him hunt - something he learns from the library. I think this book is perfect for thoughtful children who like learning about how things work. If you are going camping or think you will be spending time in nature soon, this is a great book to get your child excited about your trip. If you are not planning any nature trips soon, I strongly encourage you to read, Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv and join the \\"No Child Left Inside\\" movement."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain Trilogy (My Side of the Mountain / On the Far Side of the Mountain / Frightful's Mountain)\\"\`Any normal red-blooded American boy wants to live in a tree house and trap his own food.

He expertly learns to make his own food and house, become a falconer, and even befriend the animals of the forest. But does he really want to spend the rest of his youthful life in eternal loneliness?I thought this book was a wonderful adventure that was a different take on how we usually look at humanity. My Side of the Mountain amazed me with all the survival acts and adventures of Sam, but there really was no conflict or climax until the end of the book. Once or twice someone would get suspicious or come looking for him, but most of the time you read about how he gathers, stores, and uses food. However, I must say that the accomplishments of Sam Gribley continued to wow me, so I suggest that you give it a try if you like wilderness and nature. Although if you're like me, and like action-packed adventures, this is not the book for you.

There is a definite romance in his detailed story of survival, and although the story does lack some danger in the form of large predators or venomous snakes/insects, the threat of hunger and cold are enough to generate excitement and suspense. A wonderful aspect of this story is the warmth with which Sam relates to his father and the rest of his family - he is in the wilderness because he loves the wilderness, not because his family has betrayed or let him down, and not because they've driven him out. He is respectful of older people and friendly to younger people, and after proving that he is capable of living in the wild alone, he ultimately decides to live in society again.

And I think there are some answers there. But the basis of the whole religion is that there is absolutely no self. No separate entity known as \\"me\\". It is a way of coming at the belief that we are all one in some deep core way, which I truly believe, but just because we are all one, and my fellow human beings are as I am, does not seem to me to point to a negation of each individual. Somewhat akin to the Borgs on \\"Star Trek\\". They are all united as one body and function as one. And the power they possess in that form is darn near unbeatable. But they do not know emotion.

Her maternal grandfather, a well-to-do military man, cast off his daughter after she bore an illegitimite daughter. When Marianne inherits an old manor house from a complete stranger, she jumps at the chance to escape from the tyranny she has suffered all her life to become her own mistress.However, it is definitely NOT the thing for an unmarried woman to set up housekeeping by herself without a chaperone. The manor house servants--such as they are--take off as soon as they find out what she's planning to do. Nobody in the village wants to work for her or even speak with her in church...except a young lady with an illegitimite child of her own who knows what it's like to be stigmatized. So Hannah and her son George come to work at Bibb Grange with Marianne.But the roof leaks like a sieve; yet the thatchers won't come anywhere near Bibb Grange. What's a single woman to do? Fortunately, Marianne has made the acquaintance of the Viscount Jensen, whose grandfather founded and built the village. And although Adam Jensen has a scandalous reputation of his own to live down, as owner of the town, he has the power to persuade the villagers to do business with her.Marianne and Adam feel an immediate attraction. Marianne, however, is determined to fight it since she has no desire to end up an unwed mother and it is obvious that Adam will never make an illegitimite woman his vicountess. Although he considers making her his mistress, Adam has no desire to become leg-shackled anytime soon.But their attention is soon side-tracked when a relative of the former owner shows up hinting that the will making Marianne the owner of Bibb Grange will be contested and that she might have to leave.I am pleased to see a Regency woman with enough spunk to defy some of the ridiculous strictures on women's freedom such the right to live alone. A young lady who has learned to live with the stigma of bastardy is just the sort of woman to manage it. However, the flaws in the story made it a chore to get through at times. The romance between the two characters seems contrived and unreal. The &quot;mystery&quot; of the nocturnal intruders is too obvious. A romance between two minor characters doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the story.In summary, I would recommend that the author concentrate on the development of the romance itself and forget the armchair detective stuff. I love mysteries as well as the next person, but in a romance novel, if the romance doesn't fly, the mystery falls flat."},{"Title":"That Scandalous Heiress (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"When orphan Miss.

Even if that means that she has to go alone and unchaporoned she doesn't care because she'll have a home to call her own! However when the only 3 servents quit and leave, and the entire villiage snubs her because there is no other person with her, male or female to act as guaridan or charorone, she almost starts to doubt herself. But she's dealt with snubs before; after all most of her life people thought of her as a byblow. But she doesn't care because now she has her own home and can take care of herself. Except when it comes to her hansome neighbor Viscount Adam Jenson.Adam has come to his country estate to allow a horrible scandle to blow over. When he first arrives he doesn't want to talk to anybody, however that changes when he meets Miss McCord. This is one woman he just can't seem to get enough of, but yet drives him crazy too! For some reason she just keeps popping up in bad places and almost gets herself killed by his horse!!!This book had the potential to be a great book. Unfortuntly, the author started too many little plots to help the main plot but never finished them all. For instance, in the beginning of the book the reader is shown the BIG scandle that sent Adam to his estate. The scandle is occasionally brought up thoughout the book showing that it hasn't blown over yet, but in the end is never finished and the truth never relvealed to the reader. Also as a reader I was expecting a few confrontations and only received one, which was the one between Adam and Marianne's cousin, Titus Brougham. Another thing was the way that when Marianne admitted to herself that she loved Adam (which didn't take long) she just seem to start flinging herself towards Adam. It just didn't seem right for the regency period that a girl who wasn't a fortune hunter to try to get a kiss from a man like she did.Sorry but I give this book only 3 stars.

She sees him in an inn and he makes her nervous, she meets him again and is suddenly infatuated. In fact, they were bantering with each other like long time friends.Second, I felt that there was no explanation for why Jenson was being a little bit shunned himself, as it hinted he was. In fact, there were no signs of any such thing despite the author's constant hints. So he was a bit of a womanizer, so was everyone else. He really wasn't all that scandalous.Also, the auther kept bringing up new plot threads she never adressed. Like the idea that Jenson might keep Marianne as a mistress. It didn't even take one sentence.Finally, the mystery was flat and even though the end had everything wrapped up nicely, it seemed very contrived.However, if you're looking for a bit of light reading, don't let me discourage you.

So, when Marianne learns of an inheritance from a mysterious benefactor, she jumps at the chance to live an independent existence. She moves from Wales to the distant village of Chelmford, where she begins the task of setting her new home, Bibb Grange, to rights. It's a formidable enough task without the desertion of the Bibb Grange servants and the unfriendliness of the villagers. They do not believe that an unmarried gentlewoman would set up housekeeping alone, and thus believe the absolute worst of Marianne.The only people willing to associate with Marianne are a young village woman with a child, who becomes her housekeeper, and her next door neighbor, Lord Adam Jenson, a man with a black reputation. Adam and Marianne become close friends, in spite of both their reputations(or perhaps because of), and their rather rocky introduction(he almost ran over her with his horse). Love appears to be in the air...if Marianne and Adam could just admit it to themselves, much less each other. But someone appears to be after Marianne's humble inheritance. She finds evidence more than once that someone has been lurking around Bibb Grange at night...and inside it. Can Adam protect Marianne, especially when his own life appears to be in danger?Another excellent love story from Martha Kirkland.

I have lost almost 40 lbs. since January 6, and I feel so much better. The unlimited salad and veggies is also a help.

Yes and no. Some diets work for some people, for a while, and some don't. Often it's not easy to follow through with any diet plan, so we keep searching. Or we just give up and accept our unhealthy situation.If you want to change your thinking and focus on how you perform rather that how you look, Haas has a great plan to follow. This book, along with his previous book (Eat To Win)(although less up to date), offers an invaluable guide on why our minds and bodies behave the way they do given our exercise habits and the food we eat. Haas focuses on objective research in the field of peak performance and has a strong track record of working with champion athletes. With his research, it's easy to debunk most other &quot;trendy&quot; diets. The beauty of &quot;eating to perform&quot; is that you'll automatically get all the other health benefits of moderate exercise and intelligent eating."},{"Title":"Eat to Win for Permanent Fat Loss: The Revolutionary Fat-Burning Diet for Peak Mental and Physical Performance and Optimum Health","review":"The &quot;Ultimate Ratio&quot; of protein, carbohydrates and fat advocated in this book makes weight and fat loss almost effortless.

This plan even allows for cheating and eating at fast food restaurants! There are recipes in the back of the book for quick nutritious meals that are tasty and don't leave me feeling hungry or deprived. Not only is this an easy fat/weight loss plan, I am also eating my way to good health and high energy.

I read the Glucose Revolution at the same time and find very similar statements in both books.

The products are discontinued for the most part. So I don't know how all the other readers can sing the highest praises when it is so hard to accomplish one of the most important parts of the diet.

A low-calorie, low-fat, AND high-protein diet! The author writes &quot; . . . nutrition relies on the interplay of many compounds in foods; scientists CANNOT yet re-create the complexity in a capsule or drink. Functional foods CANNOT supplant the nutritional completeness of whole, natural foods.&quot; Yet,after having said this, the author recommends that you replace animal proteins with these new functional foods! Although he states that low-fat diets fail because human have an innate desire for fats, he recommends a low-fat(25%) diet. Tally up the calories in any of his three sample menus and you will quickly see that this is a low-calorie diet as well. He also claims that 25-50-25 is the Ultimate Ratio for weight-loss and muscle building, but 15-60-25 is the Ultimate Ratio for weight maintenance and athletic performance. Shouldn't there really be just one ULTIMATE ratio? Also he suggests that you burn just 200 additional calories a day in physical activity. Hmmm, wouldn't that alone lead to a calorie deficit and weight-loss? What's &quot;revolutionary&quot; about this diet? It's all been said before. But how does raking competitive diet plans over the coals, so to speak, in any way prove the validity of this program?

I have been able to perform better and I have more energy throughout the day. This diet is also very flexible. If you want to eat meat you can (just not too much), and you can also drink coffee and alcohol on this diet (again, just not too much).

Aiken. At times angry and disillusioned, wistful and sweet, Aiken's poems explore the themes of family, politics, racial inequality, love-and the baffling need of those among us to amass untold wealth and go to war. All of these disparate tales are told from the point of view of a man who remains true to himself and what he believes in; indeed, a man whose \\"soul is not for sale.\\"\\"Vaughn is not defined by his race,\\" the poet emphatically declares in affirming who he is in the haunting poem, Misunderstood, \\"his race is defined by Vaughn.\\" The examples he sets through impassioned, intelligent rhetoric should speak to anyone who has ever raged against injustice and intolerance.While Aiken's anger is justified-you'll nod your head at the unvarnished truth of Domestic Violence and wish more politicians would open their eyes to the wisdom of What If...?-it is the dual message of hope and compassion that resonates most strongly: \\"I planted [a] seed in me,\\" he writes, \\"and wonderful things happened. I gained knowledge of self/I knew about my people/so I planted this seed in others\\" until \\"everyone started to grow.\\"It's a shame that more of us don't nurture the seed that Aiken has so obviously brought to fruition in his own life. Perhaps if they did, people would talk on the day we die \\"about the good [we] have done and what [we] meant to each person.\\" And only that, says Aiken, is the honest measure of our worth: the fact that we have \\"made a difference in this world.\\""},{"Title":"My Soul is not for Sale: Various Poems of Love, Inspiration, and Revolution","review":"I would not consider myself a fan of poetry, but this book is different.

In fact, I don't really know much about poetry at this point. The only poet I know something about is Emily Dickinson, and Vaughh T. Aiken's \\"My Soul is not For Sale\\" is about as far from Emily Dickinson's style as one can get. So, I don't know how much use my thoughts will be on this book, but I'll share what I can.What I sense from this book is a man searching, and in many instances finding, his true identity. What is also very evident is Mr. Aiken's identification with his people and pride in his own culture. I found this a breath of fresh air, and a reminder of a world I once lived among. I lived in a mostly African American neighborhood during my teen years; and the prose in these poems, the cultural signifiers, really take me back and make me long for what was one of the happiest eras of my life.

Until his Greenland crossing on skis, few outside of Norway, or Scandinavia at the most, had heard of skiing, although of course it had existed there for centuries. The early chapter of the book on skis and \\"skilobing\\" (skiing) is a marvelous account of the sport, and particularly of Sondre Norheim and the Telemarkers who revolutionized it as recreation.Nansen writes the book in what can only be called a charming tone. He makes the crossing of the icecap seem easy, and indeed, most of the harrowing detail of the expedition relates to the efforts of the party after being dropped off at sea on the east coast of Greenland, through the ice floes with great difficulty, to an eventual landing and a hard climb up to the central ice plateau. There is also considerable detail given about the way of life of the Eskimo and Danish inhabitants of the Greenland west coast, where Nansen and his party overwintered after the crossing.A classic of \\"cold exploration\\" and a lively style and good read after more than a century."},{"Title":"The First Crossing of Greenland","review":"Do not buy from this publisher.

Through readable case studies of children and their families, Dr. Sowell draws some compelling conclusions that may well make an important contribution to the growing understanding of late talking children in relationship to Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). His findings about the numbers of families with adults working in analytical professions support similar observations of many others who come in contact with this population. I fear, however, Dr. Sowell will alienate others as he has me. I am a special education teacher specializing in early intervention services. I am aware of the startling increase in autism, PDD and other related disorders in children and share Dr. Sowell's concerns about inaccurate perceptions and labeling of children.I am puzzled, though, by Dr. Sowell's clearly negative perceptions and inflammatory statements about publi! c education. The comments and conclusions scattered throughout the book often reveal his ignorance of why and how the schools must fulfill their obligation to the Federally mandated Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This mandate is funded at only 7% of the actual cost to the public education system. The balance of 93% is funded by state and local schools. Dr. Sowell accuses the schools of greedily seeking money through their &quot;smooth talking experts&quot;who label children so they can collect special education dollars. I wonder if he realizes that what little money there is has to cover the cost of small special education classes and mandated support services such as occupational and physical therapy, speech and language therapy, nursing services, adaptive physical education, behavioral and psychological evaluation and counseling and transportation to and from school. Any monies received through a child's label are a drop in the bucket when compared ! to the actual cost of these under-funded services. The asse! ssment process and labeling to which Dr. Sowell so strongly objects are also required to establish eligibility and determine what services would be best for the child. Although I agree that people should not have to wear labels, there is little the schools can do to change that.Dr. Sowell should also know that under this same education mandate, parents are an integral part of a team made up of all those who are responsible for the child's education. The decision to place a child in special education is never made without the full participation and consent of the parents. A yearly update of the child's goals and objectives is required. Every three years, a full review is conducted and placement is reconsidered. The parents must once again give their consent to any placement. However, if the child makes unexpected progress or the parents are unhappy with the child's placement, the parent can reconvene the team at any time and would again be included in any decision abou! t the child. Once again, Dr. Sowell needs to do his homework before accusing the schools of keeping children prisoners of special education.I am concerned that Dr. Sowell's criticism of the schools will deter many parents from seeking help for their children. After age three, insurance companies often refuse to pay for needed therapies costing anywhere from $50 to $90 per hour because they know that the schools are expected to provide these services. The schools then become the only source of help for many families who cannot afford private services. Just as in other professions, not all employees of the schools come up the standards we would wish. The majority, however, are experienced, well trained professionals who treat parents and children with respect. In the majority of cases, the assessment process for young children is far different than those few unfortunate experiences described in the book. To generalize these few negative experiences over the entire nati! on's educational system is like throwing out the whole bush! el because of a few wormy apples. If Dr. Sowell really wants to help children and families, he should present a more accurate and balanced picture so that he does not deter parents from seeking the help their child may need.Dr. Sowell also discusses a few commonly used terms he finds troublesome. Whild he feels the term developmentally delayed is just a politically correct way of saying a child is retarded, most educational psychologists prefer to use that term to describe delays in young children. The reason for this comes from Dr. Sowell's own words when he describes some children who &quot;outgrow&quot; their diagnosis and eventually function within the normal range. Because young children sometimes do catch up to their age peers, the term developmentally delayed does seem the more appropriate one to use! The label &quot;autistic&quot; is also discussed. For a child to be labeled autistic, he or she must meet specific diagnostic criteria. Because of the devastatin! g effects of this diagnosis, there is rarely doubt about the child at the time it is given. In some rare, wonderful instances, children do change dramatically enough to reconsider the diagnosis. Parents new to the world ofa late talking child are not usually in a position to judge the true nature of their child's problem without a professional evaluation. For some fortunate ones, the diagnosis may turn out to be a language delay only. For others, however, it could be autism or PDD. Unlike the less serious problems associated the child who talks late, autism is a lifelong condition for which there is no known cure. It is essential for families to receive help and support as early as possible. What a shame it would be if, based on Dr. Sowell's book, parents were to avoid what may be their only source of help - the schools."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"If you are looking at this review I assume like myself, you have a child who is not talking at the age-appropriate level, and want to know what to do about it. I found this book to be simply a compilation of stories of children who are bright but spoke later than their peers. I have heard many stories like these from well-meaning friends and family. True, there are kids who are just \\"late talkers\\". I dont need to read it in a book. More importantly, it does not provide any suggestions as to how to help your late-talking child. Agree with author that it is best not to label your child PDD etc, but if that means your child will get access to help in the form of therapy, by all means explore it, but don't get bogged down by it. I worry that this book might create a false sense of security in some and delay getting help for their child. Check out the books by Marilyn C. Agin and Patricia Hamaguchi-they help you try to pinpoint your child's problems and provides suggestions as to how to help your child. You may also want to read \\" The Out of sync child\\"; occupational therapy has greatly improved my child's listening and learning ability (and hence speaking). Studies have shown that speech delay may also manifest into learning disabilities like reading/writing problems later, even self-esteem problems, topics which the author did not explore further. When it comes to our kids, it is better to be safe than sorry!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I read this book and it helped put into context my son's development.

Think of the book as a transcript of a &quot;Parents of Late Talking Children&quot; support group meeting and you won't go too far wrong. The author is a very intelligent individual who is writing this as a labor of love. For us, the most important thing was just to be able to read story after story of people who have kids like ours. The treatment suggestions are great tools to spark your thinking but use your brain and if you are unsure of something talk to your doctor or speech therapist."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I read this book and The Einstein Syndrome about 6 years ago when my son was a toddler. At the time I would have given the book 5 stars because I felt there was someone out there who understood what I was going through, and I was finally given hope for the future. My son exhibit all of the \\"symptoms\\" of a late-talker or mini-Einstein. However, at age 4, my son was diagnosed with moderate autism. Once I had an official diagnosis, I started implementing behavioral and biological interventions, and at age 8, my son now carries the diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome. I feel the book gave me false hope that everything would work itself out on its own; it fed my denial; and I delayed intensive treatments for 2 years. While my son is years ahead of his peers academically, we still require therapies, specialists, and an IEP to help with his social and organizations deficits that seem to become more apparent every year (as his peers progress). While there is nothing wrong with having hope, at the time that I read the book, I really needed a reality check."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Must read for parents with this dilema! It will put your mind at ease...or at least fill in some of the blanks."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Fascinating reading, but....A toddler's brain is enormously plastic and hardwiring at a tremendous rate, and during this critical period children most readily acquire speech. If your child is not speaking by two years old, you will be doing him a GREAT favor by taking him to a speech therapist and helping him learn to communicate. He'll be HAPPIER because he can communicate his thoughts and ideas with you and his peers.YOU'LL be happier (really!) because you'll be taking a proactive stance, instead of hoping and worrying. Speech therapy at this point is insurance. If your child does have a speech/language disorder, you'll be glad you sought early intervention. And yes, your child can be intellectually gifted and have a speech/language disorder. I know several children (including my own son) who have an IEP (special education individual education plan) in place for speech, but have tested into the gifted/talented program in elementary school. The best advice I can give you is to continue to nurture your child's strengths and please get help as soon as possible for your child's speech. In this way, you are helping your child reach his full potential.A final note: our public schools only provide speech/language services to children significantly behind their peers. (Seventh percentile and below, according to our school's diagnostician, which means your child could have a truly significant impairment, but not qualify for services). Also, schools only provide speech classes during the regular school year, and children are often taught in pairs or groups. If your insurance covers speech or you can afford it, seek help for your child from a private speech therapist, where your child will get one-on-one instruction for an hour, even during school vacations. You'll look back on this and be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This book was GREAT! A must read for parents like me with a speech delayed child. It gives you so much hope!

It is a real comfort knowing your not alone. He really understands!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I benefitted enormously from this book. I was amazed at the venom unleashed [by only a few reviewers] on this informative and helpful book, which makes no claims to be based on scientific studies but on anecdotal evidence that fell into the writer's lap because he had to struggle through the anxiety of observing and, yes, testing his own late-talking child. It is not a how-to-book, nor does it attempt to give parents diagnostic tools. The anecdotal approach is helpful because it does not present just the situation of one child, but the predicament of many who fall outside the parameters of the lists that now proliferate in the health care community which pretend to establish rigid parameters of normal development, despite disclaimers to the contrary.Late Talking Children does not pretend to be a panacea but to offer useful insight into the phenomena to parents who may well become involved with a health care system which is not always parent-, child-, or family-friendly. Kudos to Dr. Sowell."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I purchased both this book and Thomas Sowell's newer The Einstein Syndrome, only to find that they were basically the same book. The difference is that The Einstein Syndrome is based on a larger sample of children and is done more scientifically.

All that you will miss is a few anecdotes; the basic information is presented much more strongly in the second book."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Everyone I know either knows someone who talked late, or was him/herself a late talker, having no other ailments except late talking. I'm surprised someone didn't address this issue sooner. I would give this book four stars for the fact alone that it finally breeched the subject.My three-year-old does not as yet talk, and this brought me a great deal of concern. As I read this book, I wrote down every similarity between Thomas Sowell's case studies and my own child. It gave me a much more well-defined outline of what my child is going through, being extremely intelligent and developmentally the same as her peers, but having no speech.This book is not meant to diagnose. It's not even meant to stand as a general rule. What it does is create a basis of reference for parents of children who are clearly not developmentally challenged, but haven't talked yet. I think Mr. Sowell was quite clear in that his research was not concise science, and anyone who read it as such was only hoping to fool him/herself into having greater hope than there is.Read this book with a grain of salt... though it's a study on late-talking children, it is the first of its kind, and the first attempt to encourage further research. It's a terrific resource, so long as the reader is not blind to a child's actual behavioral symptoms. Let the reader come to this book with his/her child's diagnosis based in reality, and it may prove a very useful tool to understanding the late-talking child."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Thomas Sowell is one of my favorite conservative authors. He is also the father of a late talking child who was misdiagnosed with autism or other problems, when in fact there was really nothing wrong with him (other than he talked late). After writing a few columns about his son, he started to get contacted by many other people with the same situation. These contacts turned in an informal group - the members of which he writes about here. There is really not too much in this book for people who do not have family that is late-talking, but for us it was very enlightening (our son Max was late-talking). The basic conclusion of this book is that there is some unnamed, unstudied disorder which seems to make children who are very very left brained talk late. These same kids seem to excel at math, logic and computers. It is possible that the late talking is just a function of the analytical part of the brain talking all the new cells for a while and &quot;robbing&quot; the speech center. This is not the case will all children who talk late, just thost who are perfectly normal in every other way (can understand and perform other functions normally or at an accelerated rate)."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"If it were possible, we would give this book ten stars. We read this book after seeing an excerpt from Reader's Digest. At that time, our five year old had been in pre-school for two years because of his late talking and delay in social interaction. Just before he was to go to kindergarten, we were bowled over with a &quot;determination&quot; of autism by the school district. We (pediatric nurse and lawyer) knew this was incorrect, and pointed to this book as proof, as our son matched many of the patterns in the book. With this as a guideline, we contacted the current crusader for late-talkers, Dr. Camarata from Nashville (Vanderbilt Univ.), who works with Dr. Sowell. A year later, our son has made progress of up to three years in some categories due to the proper interventions and no longer shows any hint of autistic tendencies, nor is he on the autism &quot;spectrum&quot; (the new example of fitting square pegs in round holes). His social interaction is now age appropriate. This book, contrary to some reviews, does NOT give false hope, but encourages parents whose child does not fit a majority of &quot;autism&quot; characteristics to investigate further. Thank God for Drs. Sowell and Camarata -- keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"In the description of this book are the words, &quot;hardly definitive, but should ease the minds of worried parents.&quot; This concerned me deeply, and I decided to read the above book. As the mother of a child diagnosed with autism before the age of two, I am deeply grateful that my physicians took my concerns about late language seriously. Autism is a spectrum disorder. This means that there is a great deal of variability in the symptoms, the severity, and the level of functional disability. My husband was language delayed as a child, and although he &quot;turned out normal,&quot; he struggled with social situations for years before achieving &quot;normal functioning.&quot; Would an early diagnosis have helped him? I would guess that it would have helped his parents to handle his difficulties as a functional deficit, rather than as weird behavior or naughtiness that was often punished or ridiculed. My son's early diagnosis of autism was a lifesaver. He was more severely afflicted than my husband, and had we listened to the many reassurances regarding Einstein's late speech, there is no doubt in my mind that he would have endured a severe, lifelong disability. However, before he turned two we were able to obtain and implement intensive educational services that I know would not have been as effective, had we waited. At four, he has achieved a level of functioning that is remarkable, especially considering how delayed he had been. In addition, we have researched the disorder in depth, and discovered that there is an umbrella of disorders besides autism that have long been considered to be on the &quot;autistic spectrum,&quot; such as OCD, Tourettes, and some forms of schizophrenia and ADHD. Oddly enough, scientists are finding similar urinary peptides in patients with each of these disorders. This means that they may all actually be manifestations of the same biochemical disease process. The most common lamentation I have heard from other parents at support meetings is that their child's language delays were dismissed by well-meaning friends and physicians, and the late diagnosis that resulted meant months or years of lost time in which the child could have received treatment. By the way, Einstein had a great deal of social difficulties, and was considered by many to have had autism. In its most subtle form, autism is a gift of higher intellect, but in a severe form can be a terrible disability. In many cases, it is the parents' persistence, and the level of early intervention that makes the difference between the two. Language delays WITHOUT social abnormalities are usually outgrown, but still might benefit from early speech therapy. But especially if there are concerns about abnormal eye contact, social differences, lack of receptive language or pretend play, then there is no harm in calling one's county's Early Intervention program and asking for a free speech evaluation. An early diagnosis makes a huge difference in the lifetime outcome of a child with autism. Yes, this is an interesting idea for a book, but I fear that it misleads parents with a false sense of security."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"The book Late Talking Children is an invaluable resource for many parents. The author's extensive research, and experience with his own child, are just a couple of reasons readers of this book can see his caring and dedication to the subject of late talkers. I'd never seen a book dedicated solely to this mystery of the late talking population. Many parents I have spoken with since I'd read this book felt as if they were &quot;all alone&quot; before they found this book, and now can see there are many others that are going through the same things that they are. Dr. Sowell also makes it very clear that although not all late talkers are autistic, that some definately are and encourages every parent to seek many REPUTABLE professionals to get an accurate diagnosis. There are many different approaches a parent can take to help their child, and it is so important not to take the inappropriate path...and I believe this level-headed no nonsense book could help any parent of a late talker find their correct path."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"When a child is late to speak, the big red 'A' of autism is quickly branded on the child's forehead. Autism has no cure. You can't outgrow autism, yet mysteriously many children who don't speak are branded as autistic, yet experience a miraculous recovery.This book started from an off-hand comment made by economist Thomas Sowell, in his regular column about his own son. He made a comment about his child doing quite well in upper education in a highly technical, math intensive field, after being branded as an imbecile as a child, for speech delays. Mail poured in from all over the country, most letters saying, \\"That's my boy!\\". This inspired Mr. Sowell to start researching this odd phenomenon. It seemed there was little data on late speech in children of normal or higher intelligence.This first book is mostly anecdotal evidence, but as it so accurately described my husband, his father, and our children, I knew that we were on the right track. As a mother of 3 late speakers that fit the profile described in this book, I am thrilled to see that this book sparked some debate, and some research in the area of non autistic late speakers."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Thomas Sowell has done researchers a service in drawing attention to the group of children in whom delayed speech is associated with later achievements, often in maths, music or memory.However, the gaps in his knowledge of the field mean that the book is potentially misleading in certain respects. He points out the obvious fact that these children do not fit the picture of &quot;classical autism&quot; and proceeds on this basis to paint a picture of scheming schools and &quot;so-called experts&quot; out to misdiagnose and &quot;label&quot; children as autistic in order to get extra funds (what funds?).But he seems never to have heard of the autistic spectrum (almost all of his references to texts on autism date from the 70s, and Asperger's syndrome and hyperlexia, for example, are never mentioned), or to be aware that many of the traits he describes (skill with puzzles, dismantling objects, eidetic memory, advanced reading intense absorption, and so on) are often also autistic traits. Although he admits grudgingly at one point that &quot;autistic children are in some ways more extreme examples of the set of abilities and disabilities found in our group&quot;, it never occurs to him that the group might benefit rather than suffer from being considered in relation to the top end of the autistic spectrum, even if they do not fit any available diagnostic category neatly.Characteristically, such children remain &quot;different&quot; and eccentric even when they have begun talking. This difference can ultimately be as much an intellectual advantage as a disadvantage (As researchers from Hans Asperger onwards have pointed out), but to ignore it and pretend that &quot;everything is fine now he's started talking&quot; is to take a serious risk. It is disturbing to read the number of parents Sowell quotes who mention in passing that their child does seem to have some problems with social interaction, but insist that this is entirely due to the time they missed owing to delayed speech. Some such children do succeed and flourish in school and adult life without a diagnosis or any specialist support and understanding; many do not.I suppose I have a personal interest here: although I spoke early (if very bizarrely), I too was considered by some of my teachers to be &quot;like an autistic child&quot;. But since I spoke, it was assumed that I couldn't be autistic, and all my oddities and problems were attributed to my laziness, rudeness, stubbornness and &quot;just not trying&quot;. It wasn't until I was 20 (by which time I was clinically depressed after years of trying very hard and failing very hard to be like everyone else) that I was finally diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, another condition on the autistic spectrum. Finally being able to understand how I function has been a huge relief, and has enabled me to make full use of my particular, quirky strengths.If this book raises awareness that many children with highly idiosyncratic developmental patterns can become successful and flourishing adults, it will have done a great service; if it causes parents to reject any diagnosis or specialist understanding as a &quot;label&quot; and avoid speech therapy and other resources that may help, it will have done them and their children a great disservice."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This book was a godsend for me. After my 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with severe verbal apraxia but the intellect of a 6 year old, I went searching for information and help. Speech therapists, other books, web sites all put a dismal outlook on her future. BUT,I knew in my heart that things were not as bad as they seemed. I knew my child and was struggling to make sense of this. I ordered both of the authors books on speech delay and went right to work. My daughter and the study group in the book were exactly the same. This book opened windows of hope and new thinking for us. Not all doctors and \\"authorities\\" are right. Trust your gut instinct do what you think is right for your child. I did with the help and guidance of this book. Thank You Thomas Sowell."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"It made me feel a whole lot better that there are other parents out there experiencing the same problems and feelings that my husband and I are having. We are the parents of a bright three-year-old, who is speaking on a 1 1/2 year old level. He has a vocabulary of about thirty words right now, and he uses them correctly and in context. However, he is far behind his age group. My son and our families had many similarities to the children in Mr. Sowell's books, \\"Late-Talking Children\\" and \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\". However, I don't agree 100% with everything Mr. Sowell wrote, and I would never use one man's opinion as gospel. Use this book as advice to be listened to and judged by an informed mind and a parent's heart. Research, read, talk to professionals, but also listen to your gut where it concerns your child. Mr. Sowell makes a good argument for that."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"While true of some kids, the book does not portray situations true of all children. Some children do not simply start talking later, rather they have an issue than needs to be addressed earlier. The earlier a child starts to communicate (verbally, using signs), the better for his brain development. There are many disorders (for instance verbal dyspraxia/apraxia) where the child benefits greatly by getting therapy earlier. The more you wait the worse the outcome is. Because of reading this book, I delayed necessary treatment for my son until he was age four, and I highly regret it. His problem is not something that would have resolved simply on its own and the delay was not because of anything the author suggested. I am very annoyed that I was seduced by the ideas in this book, because my son's brain processing ability suffered from not getting intervention earlier."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Almost all of the content in \\"Late-Talking Children\\" is repeated in the sequel, \\"The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late\\". In reading these books back to back, I feel that the latter is really just a 2nd edition of the former despite the title change. I strongly recommend instead the \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\" published by the same author a few years later."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Dr. Sowell's book provides alot of anectdotal evidence that may provide alot of hope for parents of autistic spectrum children. As Dr. Sowell himself states - the book is not meant to be a scientific treatise - however, for parents who may see similarities between the children described in the book and their own, it is invaluable and should inspire them to never give up and to keep seeking help wherever it may be. Dr. Sowell's view of the educational establishment is only his opinion - for the benefit of the children - PARENTS, please keep reading and talking and never stop getting information that can help you to build a better future for your kids. I have read many books on autistic spectrum disorders; this book only adds to the variety of ways that I am able to help kids lead a better life."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I have read and reread Mr. Sowell's book and found it to be facinatinating, disturbing, comforting and most of all worthy of serious consideration by the medical establishment. My son who is a little over two and a half sounds almost exactly like some of the children in his book. While it is true the book is more anacdotal in it's approach it ( which he freely admits through out the book ) The case he builds for further study is overwhelming and just based on what I've discovered myself by talking to friends and family this sort of a-typical development is probably much more common then anyone in the &quot;so-called&quot; professional community is willing to admit. I recently had my son evaluated by an SLP.The result of her rather feeble eval, in my opininion, was that my son shows classic PDD (purvasive developmental DISORDER as she called it vs. DELAY ) symptoms. Fortunately, I had read Mr. Sowell's book and was skeptical at the same time not totally discounting her observations. I mentioned this book and she had said she had never heard of it. I was somewhat surprised considering the outrageous smear campaign ASHA has led against it. We have since had him reevaluated and the new SLP was much more open to this possibility while saying further evals were needed by a Nuerologist, Psychologist, team which is already scheduled and something I wanted to have done anyway.But anyone who is interested in the enigma of the late speaking child should read this book! Also, this is the only book I've found that offers a ray of hope for anyone in this sort of situation, the other &quot;Speech,Language and Hearing problems : what every parent should know&quot; by Hamaguchi reads more like ASHA propaganda but at the same time is useful to deciphering SLP speak. But if you read that one and before Mr. Sowell's your heading for a major bout of depression!Mr. Sowell as it turns out seems to share my exact same political and cultural attitudes to today's society much to my surprise! Coincidence, probably not.I need to read more from this amazing forward thinker! If you read this review Mr. Sowell thanks and I'll help carry this torch you've lit!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This is absolutely the most misleading book I've read about children and speech delays. The cavalier \\"wait and see\\" attitude is insulting. If a child is not speaking by the age to 2 years, it is possible that unlike Albert Einstein, the child may have a condition on the Autistic Spectrum or a cognitive delay of some sort. In the meantime, postponing Early Intervention and denying the child an opportunity to work with a Speech Language Pathologist because you're just certain he or she will talk is utterly absurd. If you're a parent and you know in your gut that your child's speech delay may be a sign of something more, don't waste your money or time on this book. Instead, read The Late Talker. This book is based on a handful of parents who have written Sowell in response to an article he wrote about a child of his who was \\"a late talker.\\" Having a child who has been diagnosed with Hypotonia, PDD-NOS, and Sensory Processing Disorder, I can tell you that my little one is not just \\"a late talker\\" AND has not been grossly misdiagnosed. There is much more to her condition than simply being \\"a late talker.\\" I am just thankful that I had the foresight to give her all the therapy she needed starting at 12 months old rather than taking the \\"wait and see\\" path offered here. I'm thankful I didn't come across this book when I was desperately soul searching and second guessing whether I should move forward with Early Intervention. I can't even imagine where my little one would be without all of the wonderful therapy she has received and all of the progress she has made."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I was dissapointed with this book. I was hoping for an explanation of developmental speech delay and/or a parent's first hand account of how to help a &quot;late talker&quot; develop his speech skills. I already know my child is not autistic, and that he is exceptionally bright, and that there are others like him. If all you need to know is that you and your child are not alone, buy this book. If you are looking for answers, save your money."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"It is extremely surprising to me that a man of Thomas Sowell's erudition could write this book.I am a parent of a late-talking child with high intelligence. He has some of the behavioral characteristics of the children whose case histories appear in this book, and like some of them, he was given a diagnosis of PDD-NOS. We have aggressively pursued treatment for him, with the result that his speech and socialization now appear close to normal. When he enters kindergarten in '99, there will be no question that he belongs in a normal classroom; the school he enters will be unaware that he has ever had problems, and his behavior won't tip them off. The same could have been true of the children described in Sowell's book; but it has not been, because those children's problems were not treated; everyone was too busy insisting that &quot;my son couldn't be autistic; look at him, he can do puzzles/ math problems/ pick locks/ play on our computer!&quot; It's time for a wake-! up call, parents; that's what mildly afflicted autistic-spectrum children of high intelligence do.Even Sowell's statistics are questionable. He claims that it is noteworthy that every child in his sample had a close relative who is either in a technical field or a musician. Think about the proportion of engineers in the population; think about the number of families which, if one includes aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents, have technical members. For Sowell to leave this question of statistical strength unaddressed is shocking.Yet, this book is important in that it focuses on bright children with mild autistic spectrum disorders, who may look autistic as young children but whose outcomes are often good. This class of children has long gone unrecognized by a mainstream autism community which refuses to believe that autism spectrum disorders can be treated effectively, to the point of near-recovery. But leaving these kids untreated isn't the way to go; one is leav! ing to chance what should be, and can be, taken into our ha! nds. If a parent starts specialized education early -- and effective treatement can start before the child is 2 -- the problem can be gone by the time the child reaches kindergarten.There is a yawning gap in literature on, and awareness of, children with mild autistic spectrum disorders. Thomas Sowell has tried to fill the gap -- but badly and wrongly. His recommendation that late-talking children be left untreated, lest they be labeled by their school systems, is likely to leave many parents who latch onto his book, because of its heartening message, feeling terribly sick and sorry when their children are older."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I was amazed by the accuracy of the evaluation,treatment and development of late-talkers children. I am a father of a 5-years boy that started to talk at 3.5 years old.

The only regret i have is that i can not write the book as i would be suspected in coping from author's book. G R E A T !!!!!!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"It is a touching and helpful book. It has little in the way of statistics or scientific research to back up its observations. Sowell takes predictable swipes at the educational establishment. Still, that said, I would recommend it to worried parents as interesting and reassuring."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I gave this book one star only because zero stars was not an option!While this book provided some interesting observations and insight, I found the author to be patronizing, arrogant and offensive. My son's speech pathologist was not even able to finish the book because it frustrated her so much. Thomas Sowell seems to be rationalizing his own child's experience and using this book to reassure himself. The tone of the book implies that children with \\"other problems\\" are lost causes and not capable of contributing to society in a worthwhile way.The fact is that all children have needs to varying degrees and in various ways. Just because a child's needs may be more demanding than the 'average' child - it does not mean that they are unworthy of love and attention. (One parent's account in the book actually states that she had given up on her child when he had been diagnosed as autistic. After the family was told by other providers that the child was not autistic - the mother confessed to her sleeping child that she would never stop loving him again!!!) I need books that inspire me to provide the best for my child. While, Thomas Sowell actually discourages early intervention. This type of wait-and-see approach can only allow the gap of the delay to grow larger, as apposed to nipping the problem in the bud or hopefully finding out that intervention is not necessary.If you are just trying to reassure yourself that your child is just a late-talker than this book may satisfy your need. However, if you are trying to get some quality information regarding speech delays...I suggest you look elsewhere. Specifically, I recommend \\"The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet.\\" by Agin, Geng and Nicholl."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Although initially enamored and relieved by this book, I have come to feel betrayed by it. Our son, who appeared to us to be speech-delayed but otherwise fairly normal, has recently been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. I did not know about autism and the wide variety of severity and symptoms children on this spectrum can display. I read this book a year ago and it made me falsely suspicious of school officials who suggested that we get an autism evaluation but did not articulate why it was important to get one right away. The book also made us falsely trusting of our pediatrician, who asked a few questions and told us our son would probably grow out of it (he was well -meaning, but unfortunately not well-informed about the differences between typically developing children and those on the autism spectrum.). Given the lack of understanding and institutional biases of school officials, our pediatrician, and even our local medical school, I did not learn until very recently that our son is in fact autistic and that there is a relatively short preschool window of time during which children can benefit enormously from intensive intervention. If you are concerned about your child's late talking please consider getting him or her evaluated by autism experts immediately and/or dive at once into the many excellent books on this subject. (Your child may have another problem--the books on autism can help you figure that out.) For starters, I would read Bryna Siegel's World of the Autistic Child and Temple Grandin's Thinking in Pictures. (Siegel's book will really help you figure out for yourself if your child is on the spectrum or not--though I would never recommend foregoing a professional evaluation. Grandin's book is utterly fascinating for any thoughtful person and well worth reading no matter what your child turns out to be.) Shirley Cohen's Targeting Autism provides a well-researched and balanced view of the polarized treatment community. The leading behavioral therapy approach has been championed by Catherine Maurice, the mother of two autistic children who has written or edited several good books on the subject. Stanley Greenspan's deveopmental model has strong support, too. Frederick Volkmar's Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders is expensive and geared to the health care professional, but excellent if you are the type of parent who wants a high level of information (most but not all of it is accessible to the intelligent layperson). Good luck. There are many of us traveling the same road."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I would recommend other parents of young children with speech problems at least look into this book by Thomas Sowell. The book is not a substitute for accurate medical and speech/hearing diagnosis, in fact Sowell himself has pointed this out in the book and subsequent syndicated columns. The author seeks to assist families of a subset of children with speech and language delays to have hope and realize they are not alone. Our family found &quot;Late-Talking Children&quot; to be very enlightening and ultimately assisted us in seeking the consultation of Stephen Camarata PhD at Vanderbilt University in Nashville TN. The result was that our son progressed more rapidly and with more specific-to-his-needs speech therapy. We are very pleased with the the results! Now, this book may or may not be the answer concerned parents are seeking. But keep an open mind and an open heart when you read this book. In case this book should in fact be helpful to your child and your family's situation, I am pleased to offer this positive review of Thomas Sowell's &quot;Late-Talking Children&quot; for your consideration."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"My 3 year old son excells in most areas except speech.

A diagnosis of PDD-NOS was considered due to a range of extremely mild symptoms, but in the end it could not be supported by the various independent professionals we hired.Dr. Sowell's book offers parents an important source of antidotal information that is sorely lacking in the literature. This book must however be read with caution. The numerous stories Dr. Sowell presents are of children who presented only \\"expressive\\" communication disorders. As he rightly points out in the text, the prognosis for children whose expressive and receptive skills are delayed is not necessarily as optimistic.I was troubled by one recurring theme in the text. Dr. Sowell was, in my opinion, overly critical of the medical and educations professionals who are tasked with providing assessments and treatment options for \\"children at risk\\". In my experience in Canada we have found the level of professionalism of local child physiologists, pediatricians, speech therapists, social workers, and many others to be absolutely outstanding. Even our son's nursery school teachers have proven to be invaluable resources in our search for answers to our son's communication difficulties.I am very comfortable recommending this book to any parent whose child \\"does not quite fit\\" the PDD-NOS label. To those who follow though, remember, there are treatment options out there that are based in common sense, and probably do help. Don't use this text as an excuse to not seek advice and assistance. If you suspect a problem begin discussing it with your child's doctor.In conclusion, \\"Late Talking Children\\" offers much need hope, with concrete examples of numerous children.

The author, Thomas Sowell, is the father of a late-talking and obviously intelligent son. This book is the result of an investigation he began in response to the lack of information he encountered in his own efforts to understand and help his son. The voices of the parents of other late-talking children he encounters speak movingly as they describe their struggles with the education and psycho/medical establishments searching, as he did himself, for answers and help, but finding, more often than not, unhelpful labeling and classification.. No parent's voice is more moving than his own. His quest was obviously heartfelt. The results of his researches are eye opening. I recognized my son; I recognized my father; I recognized my family, as did many others. I am grateful to Dr. Sowell for undertaking this study, and for understanding the need of others in our position to hear the heartening results . The book is well reasoned, and jargon free.

He reminds us that \\"every child is different.\\" We've all heard that expression used to catch the vagaries of the development process, but you'll never realize how hollow it can ring until some childcare type tells you that they think your child may be developmentally delayed. This book helps deal with the certainty that your child *is* different and puts it in perspective. It should be read along with the followup book \\"The Einstein Syndrome.\\"After two years of self-study in this area, I still found a great deal to learn in these books. Most of all, I found a lot of hope and perspective regarding kids that don't sit up and elocute at 18 months.The best advice in this book: take your children with you everywhere, expose them to everything possible. When they're ready to communicate, you'll have lots to talk about. My son is still working his way along, but we've made great progress, as others have, by letting him have some space and grow at his own pace.Another great idea reinforced by this book: Don't assume that your child doesn't understand or is behind because they don't speak. I've seen childcare \\"professionals\\" that make this mistake every day.Finally, this book hints at the danger of over-assessing children and the problems of the incentive structures within public schools. I have seen first-hand how problematic the opinions of pseudoprofessionals can be, and how unscientific they are. The second book covers this threat to society in more depth.This book helped me help my son, and that's the important thing. We are in debt to Dr. Sowell for bringing this issue to light."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I read this book because I was so worried about my son. After having 3 daughters, I noticed that my son's speech was delayed. The words \\"autism\\", \\"speech therapy\\", and other associated words cropped up in the \\"professionals'\\" language. When I read this book, it was like I was reading a biography of my son. Now, 3 years later, he's still following the pattern of the kids in this book. His speech is so much better, and I have to laugh because had I taken him to speech therapy, I would have been impressed at how well it must have helped! Some people get very angry towards this author because they say that their children really are autistic and they wasted time by not treating their children after reading this book. If that's the case, then the author isn't talking about their children and he makes that clear in his book. Sowell saved me lots of time, money, and anxiety."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I understand why some reviewers disliked this book, but as a parent who was starting to freak out, I was thrilled to get it.I put my son (now almost 6) in speech therapy when, at 1 1/2, he only spoke two words. He had hearing tests, brain scans, everything possible to try to figure out what was wrong, and the speech pathologist determined there was absolutely no reason why he wasn't talking except that he didn't want to. At 2, his nonverbal skills were at a 6 year old level, but verbally he tested at 11 months.I bought this book when my son was 2 1/2, and it changed every doubt I ever had about myself as a parent. He didn't just have a few similarities; it seemed Dr. Sowell was writing about him exactly. I was (and am) completely convinced the the phenomenon of right-brain dominance exists, although the SLP we were seeing refused to acknowledge it. Two months before my son turned 3, he woke up one morning speaking in sentences and is gifted (as the children in the book were) in music, math, and memory.Unfortunately, most children will not fit Sowell's pattern, and autism/PDD are realities for many parents. But for those who are at the end of their rope and KNOW their child doesn't fit into any of the labels, this book could change your life."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"My son was 3 years old and still not talking when I happened upon this book at a used book store. I felt like I'd been handed a gift from God. I read the book, then re-read it, highlighting the areas that described my son perfectly. I cried as I did so because, for the first time, I didn't feel alone. This book give invaluable insight into children, like my son, who are obviously bright, just not verbal. The text is clearly written, easy to understand, and gives practical advice for seeking help with your non-verbal child. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's child is not talking by age 2."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This is a great book for parents of late talking children who do not know where to turn when all the experts tell you things you know are not true about your child.You will find several examples of different late talkers and what became of them as adults. With this information you will see that there is light at the end of the tunnel and a very bright light it is.This book also gives you examples of different programs that parents have put their children in and how it effected them.This book is a wonderful book for parents of late talkers and it will open new doors for you. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I would recommend other parents with young children with speech problems at least look into this book by Thomas Sowell. Be aware that Sowell himself, in his book and syndicated columns, does urge parents to get a thorough medical exam and accurate speech and language diagnosis, and that his book is the result of experiences among a small support group of parents. However, the book does offer some theories on some common characteristics of a subset of children with speech and language disorders or delays. If you keep those perspectives in mind while reading it the potentially controversial aspects of it become less of a problem. My husband and I found a lot of hope and &quot;real life&quot; in Sowell's book. Our son also seemed to fit the hypothetical profile of Sowell's initial support group, and we also took our son to see Stephen Camarata PhD at the Child Language Intervention Program at Vanderbilt University (www.tsowell.com). After consulting with Dr. Camarata we were able to obtain more accurate diagnosis and eventually individually targetted speech therapy for our son. The excellent results were that our son with specific therapy progressed faster than otherwise might have. We are pleased with the results and are thankful for both Drs. Sowell and Camarata in their efforts to assist a certain subset of children with speech problems. Keep an open mind. Indeed this book may not be for everyone and if it doesn't match you or your family's situation then so be it. But in case it does match your family's situation, we found this book to be _very_ helpful, provide peace of mind and positive direction for parental advocacy and a possible avenue to obtain accurate diagnosis and treatment."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Those those parents who might feel alone with a late-talking child who might have gifts in MUSIC, MATH, and/or MEMORY and relatives who are engineers or musicians - this book is for you.While many children with speech and perhaps developmental delays may fit under the umbrella of PDD or \\"autism,\\" there is a unique group of square pegs who were not identified (except by their puzzled parents) - up 'til now. We struggled for two years to ensure that our daughter was not forced into a learning environment with PDD students exclusively. Close observation of those classes, especially after reading this book, revealed to me as a parent obvious differences between and and \\"ES\\" child and one with PDD.Thus this story chronicles the awakening of our consciousness group of bright children who are often misdiagnosed and misplaced withinThanks to this book, our perserverence, and 3 insightful teachers, our daughter excels in school and is enjoying expressing herself in the school's drama club. She remains eccentric, but well-adjusted.Thomas Sowell's writing is elegant and clear. Part anecdotal; part analytical with the aid of Stephen Camarata of the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. There will be no doubt in your mind after reading this book whether you child fits The Einstein Syndrome (his most recent book) or not...This book is not meant to be a substitute for examinations by one or more MDs who specialize in Child Development or Developmental Pathology - but it is a critical resource for anyone whose child matches the criteria outlined by Dr. Sowell and/or feel there child just doesn't fit into the PDD mold.Those who have children with \\"The Einstein Syndrome\\" may also find individual speech therapy helpful in mainstreaming your child early in the public schools, as we did."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This book is very specific in that it talks of children (mostly boys) who do not talk for a very specific reason. This is for children who do not talk because they are gifted in the areas of math, music and abstract arts. The children eventually talk with a little help from their parents and professionals. The children excel at numbers and sometimes have musical gifts.My child did not fit this specific area so it was not useful to me. Regardless it was well written, easy to understand and had plenty of examples and real life events. The author is driven by the topic and knows it well. If your child fits the specific audience, it is a must read as it has many contacts and ideas for helping this specific type of child."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"We bought this book and also the book &quot;Childhood Speech, Language &amp; Listening Problems&quot; (Hamaguchi). Both books were/are useful in helping us pursue the mystery of our 2 3/4 yr old daughter's speech delays, but it is &quot;Late Talking Children&quot; that is by far and away the more important of the two books. It not only offers hope, it offers the possibility that the medical establishment doesn't have all the answers every time, that this might just be the pattern of development for a certain subset of the population. Unfortunately, some of the professionals that we have had to deal with so far seem to want to put labels on our child when there just isn't the evidence to support those conclusions. It has added stress when it shouldn't have. Sowell's book has helped decrease stress. I think I am a better, stronger advocate for my daughter in pursuing intervention, POSITIVE intervention, as a result of the shared experiences in this book. It helps me to trust my instincts that a treatment or doctor is being more hurtful than helpful. (Then I am free to find the more caring professionals in my community, and they exist, too.) If that is all this book ever does for anyone, that is extremely helpful!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I read this book when my \\"severe communication disordered\\" (age 3)\\"PDD\\" (Age 3.5) \\"Educationally Autistic\\" (age 4 )\\"Asperger's\\"(Age 4.5) ADHD (Age 5) PDD-NOS (Age 9) son was age 3. It has been in the back of my mind all that time. I think there is more to it than what I would like to admit. If I had it to do all over again, I'm not sure I would go the therapy route because it IS SO STRESSFUL and forces you to look at all the negatives, and you tend to discount the gifts and look for \\"cures\\" all the time.My son is adopted, so it is not \\"genetic\\", but my husband was a late talker...not a peep until age 4 and full sentences at that time. My mother in law was told that both he and his brother were retarded in kindergarten. His brother is a late bloomer studying to be a CPA...My husband (age 48) works for a state archives and is the Education Director, and is presently writing the 3rd grade Social Studies book (he was a teacher for 10 years). He is considering looking for Federal employment in DC...maybe we are \\"Eccentric\\", but who gives a hoot!!!! It's a good life.By the way...my husband never used to look me in the eye, but I fell in love with his mind so I didn't notice...My son, age 9, is just beginning to open up. His gift is cartooning. That's the part no special Ed teacher will tell you...that there is often a gift. Who gives a hoot about school..life tends not to imitate the \\"cookie-cutter\\" fit mandated there, anyhow.I believe Mr Sowell has a grand point to make. The anxiety caused by the label can do far more harm than good. I think his politics are lousy, however (tongue in cheek...)."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"When my daughter was diagnosed as developmentally delayed I became highly distraught. I wondered daily what I had done wrong. She seemed so normal in every other aspect of development. My father saw a piece on Thomas Sowell on an evening news program where the book Late Talking Children was discussed. I purchased the book the next day and it had so many similarities to my situation that it was able to ease my fears about my daughter. Her communication skills are developing nicely today but her mental skill level has been developing at an above average rate. This book gave my family hope that my daughter is fine and only developing at her own rate. Thanks"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"As a parent with a late talking child I found this book inspiring, hopeful and useful. My child meets all of the criteria listed and has indeed developed as outlined in this book. An excellent read for parent who have children who fit the \\"Sowell profile\\"."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I fear that this book will be misleading to parents. The authorseems to be under the assumption that schools profit from labelingchildren as disabled. They do not. In my experience they do everything in their power to keep boderline children from receving sspecialized services. It costs them more money and they have to hire more professionals. The author tries to convince parents that a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder is the same as a diagnosis as autism. This is not true. If parents decide to read this biased book, they should start with chapter 4 first because it disscusses some of the reasons for children to be talking late."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"We know there are late talking children. But most children who do not talk by the age 2 1/2 usually have PDD(autism spectrum, Pervasive development disorder). My only fear is a parent whose child is potentially a PDD may delay seeking medical help if they read such book. I urge all the parent who have late talking children not to take author's word but to get their child evaluated as early as possible. It is cheaper to get the child evaluated by a medical professional then buying this book and having a false sense of relief"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This book gives false hope to parents whose children are nonverbal due to PDD,Tourete Syndrome, SI dysfunction, Asperger systromes or children with undiagnosed Oral motor Problem. So Readers beware."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"Parents don't want a label for their child. They don't want to see doctors, get a diagnosis, struggle to help for their child and get the services they need. This book scares me because it tells your inner voice worried about your child to be quiet and that you just need to wait it out and everything will be fine.I am sure for some \\"nervous parents\\" this is good advice and you can wait for your child to speak. If this is you - you are lucky and blessed. For the 99% others out there - IT IS TIME TO GET BUSY. THIS IS YOUR WAKE UP CALL. EARLY INTEVENTION IS THE KEY TO YOUR CHILDS FUTURE SUCCESS.Please, for your child - get a good diagnosis, see at least three to four specialists for your childs needs/deficits and address them immediately. That time is better spent vs. reading this book."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This book, like Mr. Sowell's past columns and current book on this subject have very little to do with child development and a great deal to do with destructive and wholly wrong stereotypes and myths.We have more than 30 years of clinical evidence that autism, and other PDD spectral disorders are neurologically based and have no connection to \\"refridgerator moms\\" or other hideous long standing myths. Further, we have decades of clinical evidence that shows, clearly, that although delayed in social and communication skills, even the most severely autistic child is typically loving and affectionate. In fact, affect, in the form of a warm patient/therapist relationship, is central to the only autism early interventions with significant clinical evidence to support their theraputic value.Special bonds with a particular adult, child, or sibling are so common that the DSM diagnostic guidelines were revised to emphasis age appropriate peer to peer behavior when analyzing social development. Yet still, for more than a decade, Mr. Sowell has recited the myth of autistics being unable to build relationships to justify his division of a logical, broad spectrum of symptoms into distinct and unrelated groups.I understand the need for emotional crutches. I see it not in parents \\"traumatized\\" by the stigma of an autism label, but in parents living with its reality. Or in the reality of nuturing children with Down syndrome, CP, or other severe disabilities. It is a tremendous burden, and it takes its toll on many. But what I do not understand is the need to create crutches by dehumanizing some of society's weakest members.A low functioning autistic child often lives in a world where sounds are painful and terrifying, touch feels like acid on the skin, and words come with only agonizing difficulty. These children have to overcome tremendous fear and anxiety to perform even simple tasks, yet they learn, love, and try. Parents who need to pound them into inhuman crutches to cope with their own fears and anxieties should feel, I think, less reassured and more ashamed."},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"This was a waste of my time! I sat there and read about this boy and what he could do! Then read about more kids and what they were good at. It should have another title about not labeling our kids or something. Not late talking children that makes me think that is going to help me with my late talker. Why was this even published. I could go and write about my son and how he is sooo smart but doesn't talk yet. WOW you would really care!"},{"Title":"Late-Talking Children","review":"I was hesitant to read this because a speech langauge therapist had not written it. As a speech language therapist, I was HORRIFIED by the content of this book. Every child that was listed in this book sounded as if he/she had some type of austism. He even had the nerve to disvalue the early interventionist of the world. Early intervention is the KEY! It is not NORMAL for children to begin talking at 3 or 4.Please do NOT read this book. It is full of mistruths. If you want to read something about late talkers read a book written by a speech language therapist or a linguist."},{"Title":"Pro Techniques of Creative Photography: Methods of the Thinking Photographer.","review":"Ian Bradshaw's book was an early find during my retirement-age re-embrace of photography, and I continue to review and learn from it.

It allows one to be intuitive as well as analytical. too bad it is out of print.

I especially liked the map of River Heights and the surrounding areas. I grew up reading Nancy and now am an avid collector. I must say that the application of psychology to Nancy Drew is probably unwise. Nancy is a character. Too much analysis leaves young readers less capable of picturing their own personal Nancy. Much of the analysis is negative, which defeats the purpose of Nancy Drew. Nancy serves to prove to young girls that there is a heroine out there with spunk, courage, kindness and true goodness - someone they can aspire to be like. It isn't relevant that her perfection is unattainable. If she were realistically flawed she would not be the heroine and role model that she has become to so many. I almost felt disloyal to Nancy for reading some of the criticism. Furthermore, Nancy Drew books are entertaining. Without the bad guys, Nancy would serve no relevant purpose. I don't think her mysteries emphasize violence at all. In fact, you will notice that none of her captors ever really harms her. She gets a good fright but there are few references to guns or knives. It is good old fashioned smarts that wins Nany her cases - not knock 'em down gun fights."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Nancy Drew: Girl Sleuth on the Couch","review":"Applying Jung's archetype psychology becomes clear after reading Caprio's explanation.The best layman book on the subject I have ever read. I have given it to friends because I enjoyed it so much. They also greeted the excellent information with appreciation for the clarity it brings to the study of archetypes. It was Great! I hope Caprio researches more archetypes and publishes more soon."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Nancy Drew: Girl Sleuth on the Couch","review":"As an earlier reviewer noted, Caprio does a superb job of making Jungian concepts comprehensible and relevant for the layperson how has not read all of Jung's works. She skillfully applies Jungian analysis to Nancy Drew, not so that we might understand Nancy better, but so that we will ultimately undertand ourselves better.But the book is not at all a &quot;heavy read.&quot; Ms Caprio has a deft touch with humor. She regularly sneaks in some sly (but affectionate) digs at Nancy that will have you laughing out loud!Admirably, Ms Caprio has provided lots of visual illustrations in the book -- well-remembered Nancy Drew illustrations, as well as specially commissioned art.I'm tempted to buy a stack of these to give to friends!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Nancy Drew: Girl Sleuth on the Couch","review":"This book was well thought to me. I have read Nancy Drews, although she does not do anything that is not perfect, and excells at everything, which us unrealistic. I always though she would be more of a role model if she wasn't number one at everything, and had real problems with life, showing girls maybe how to deal on their own too. But anyway, I liked this because it was well thought out, and the title even maybe negative,may in one way have a point. The book is good, but you decide on Nancy Drew."},{"Title":"Outfoxed: Marvin Davis, Barry Diller, Rupert Murdoch and the Inside Story of America's Fourth Television Network","review":"First off, one should immediately disregard JHW's review of this book. JHW has apparently confused this book with the documentary film of the same name. (Which is particularly evident in the book's copyright date, 1990, many years before Fox News Channel came to be.) There is absolutely nothing about the Fox News Channel in this book. Absolutely nothing.Outfoxed (the book) tells the story of the birth of the Fox television network (again, **not** the cable news channel!). The book is divided roughly into equal thirds: the first third deals with the tangled saga of the Twentieth Century-Fox studio, its struggles to remain afloat, and its ownership by Marvin Davis (and later buyout by Rupert Murdoch). The middle third deals with the launch of the Fox Broadcasting Company and focuses primarily on what was intended to be the new network's crown jewel, \\"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\\". Finally, the last spends its time on the growing pains of the new network, trying to find a programming foothold (and ratings success) while pushing the definitions of quality, acceptability and decency to their limits.Honestly, in reading this book, I could have done without the first third. Lots of history of Twentieth Century-Fox (the film studio), lots of behind-the-scenes stories of the studio's troubles and power struggles. This was supposed to be a book about a television network, and some background on Fox's history is certainly important, but 80 pages? After reading this book, I found myself thinking I could have simply picked it up at page 70 and not really missed out on anything needed to enjoy the rest of the book.The remainder of the book makes for a somewhat nostalgic look back at Fox; much of the action in the book took place twenty years ago. Some of the shows discussed are still on the air--\\"America's Most Wanted\\" and \\"Cops\\"; some are gone but remembered--\\"21 Jump Street\\", \\"Married...with Children\\"; and others are simply forgotten to the mists of time--\\"Beyond Tomorrow\\", \\"Mr. President\\", \\"Totally Hidden Videos\\". Along the way, the careers of Barry Diller, Jamie Kellner, Garth Ancier, Kevin Wendle, Peter Chernin, and many others are detailed.Overall, it's a good read for anyone interested in television history (particularly as Fox is still around and the current can be readily compared to the past).And again, this book has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the Fox News Channel. (Indeed, one of the most interesting tidbits in this book: Rupert Murdoch's support for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter in 1980...go figure!)"},{"Title":"Outfoxed: Marvin Davis, Barry Diller, Rupert Murdoch and the Inside Story of America's Fourth Television Network","review":"Inside this book you'll find some disturbing and interesting information on how fox has twisted the news to support its owner's politics over fact and truth.

You should still seek out an experienced mentor--someone familiar with prepping and showing your breed...but barring any other input this book WILL get you started. It can't help you with breed specifics, but I found it TREMENDOUSLY informative on the little details for giving your best \\"presentation\\" in the ring. Everything from how to hold your leash to how to dress is covered. Yes, that would be redundant for an experienced exhibitor....however even those with YEARS of experience in ANYTHING can always learn something new.

Unlike other books one reads for classes this book had a wealth of information and was interesting. Berton in this book has a conversation with &quot;Sam&quot;, known to most as Uncle Sam represents the people of the United States, whom Burton conveys Canadian's feelings and sediment towards Americans in. This conversation is a key feature of the book that I found interesting. I recommend this book to Americans and Canadians alike because of the comparisons Berton makes between the two groups.

In short, he explains to his befuddled American buddy not only what it is to be a Canadian but \\"why we act like Canadians\\"!If there were a position corresponding to \\"poet laureate\\" for historians or journalists, it's an odds on bet that Pierre Berton would be the man for Canada. His writing is easy going and emminently readable but at the same time it is scrupulously well researched and complete.Recommended reading for any Canadian who would like a deeper understanding of the fundamental reasons for our typical behaviours and, in the spirit of fostering a higher degree of friendship and mutual understanding, it ought to be mandatory reading for all students in the USA.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Why We Act Like Canadians","review":"I bought this book as a US Citizen living in Canada.

It is after all, a short story, revisiting Lythande the sorcerer/magician, and not a huge novel in and of itself.This novel is a really fun read, because it gives the reader a glimpse of Marion Zimmer Bradley's world, but does so with a bit of humor. &quot;Gratitude of Kings&quot; is full of symbolism, and I feel that the book's message is very clear.This is simply a delightful, &quot;not too deep&quot; novel, and for those unaccustomed to MZB's work, a quick look at her ability to make fantasy completely believable, and another of her fine offerings which focus around the power of women, whatever form that power may take!"},{"Title":"The Gratitude of Kings","review":"I am delighted to have the opportunity to read yet another story of Lythande the magician.

Nobody must know that she is female, because otherwise she would lose all her powers and die. In this novella Lythande is asked to be the King's champion at the wedding games, but she knows that there is something terribly wrong with this wedding and she has to find out what before it is to late. This is a strong story with wonderful characters and a colourful setting.

However, I greatly enjoy this little field trip into a well-detailed fantasy world. She explains just enough for someone who doesn't know all the background of her work to follow along, and makes it all seem so natural. (And the plot's pretty good, too!)

Many reviewers have focused upon this book as a defense of the Christian mission enterprise. This is, however, an incorrect assessment of a deep investigation into the reception of the gospel message. Sanneh demonstrates that it is not the transmission of the message that is central, but the local acceptance and adaption of the good news in local languages and categories of interpretation.In the course of his argument he also shows that the gospel cannot be otherwise, for it is the nature of grace to translate the message into local thought forms and thus be transformed by these local categories.&quot;Translating the Message&quot; is essential reading for all who are interested in the advent of non-Western Christianity."},{"Title":"Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture","review":"Translating the message is a theoretical book that primarily concerns itself with one area in the history of Christian mission work--translation. Sanneh attempts to demonstrate through an analysis of the history of Christian mission that a central characteristics of Christian mission is that it enjoys a symbiotic relationship with the world's various cultures; the Gospel adapts to it and the culture responds the the Gospel through resurgence, cultural pride, and a move toward righteousnessSanneh first examines the early Church's apostolic missionary efforts to proclaim the Gospel among Greek-speaking gentiles. While there was an ethnocentric attitude on the part of Jewish Christians, God made his desire that the Gospel be preached to many cultures known primarily through the miracle at Pentecost and then subsequently through other miraculous signs as Gentile individuals and groups came to faith (e.g. Cornelius and his family). The Greek-speaking Gentile culture received the Gospel through vernacular preaching and found that it fit so naturally into their culture that they began to believe that when the Gospel came to these Greek-speakers, it came to its natural home. The result was a resurgence of cultural pride as they allowed the Gospel to shape them.The experience of the early Church's missionary activity set a pattern that would be repeated throughout the church's life as it sought to spread the Gospel. As the Gospel was spread to Northern Europe and later to Asia, the Americas, and Africa, tension existed between Christians who advocated a conversion toed to cultural conformity (especially linguistic) and Christians who valued a conversion that allowed for a unique cultural expression of their new faith, especially in their native tongue.A special focus is placed on post-Reformation missionary work in Africa as this is the author's own area of academic expertise and also because the African experience shows the extremes of both missionary paradigms--Western control and forced conformity as well as total cultural transference of the Gospel. Through this, Sanneh demonstrates that where missionaries are willing to allow a culture to have a translated Bible, express the Christian faith in their own way, and gradually take ecclesiastical leadership, the Church flourishes. Where missionaries attempt to change the culture, prescribe expression of faith, are reluctant to put a vernacular Bible in the peoples' hands, and local leadership is restricted, the Church struggles.The book ends with a comparison between the spread of Christianity and the spread of Islam in Africa. While Christianity values cultural transference of the faith and Scripture/worship in the vernacular, Islam insists on maintaining an Arabic Koran and worship language. While the missionary paradigms differ radically (sanneh calls them mirror images of one another), each religion has managed to take hold in Africa.Appendices include selections from Vatican II that reflect the Catholic church's growing acceptance of indigenous expressions of faith, a table showing the progress the Church has made in translating the Scriptures into the world's languages, and a list of languages that have a complete vernacular Bible along with the year this translation was completed.There do exist flaws in Translating the Mission. One is that it is incomplete in terms of its theology. While it is true that much understanding of theology is culturally conditioned, not all theology is subjective. Where the line is drawn is not always clear and (admittedly) the purpose of this book is not to draw this line, but the fact that heterodoxy and orthodoxy are not addressed decreases the usefulness of this book. When Gnosticism, charismatic theology (prophesy, healing), and liberation theology are addressed, they are all assumed to be authentic expressions of Christianity, to be accepted because they are grass-roots movements. However, just as translated Bibles are \\"handed down\\" to other nations, so doctrine is also to be \\"handed down\\" or at the very least regulated. How the training of natives and balancing doctrinal purity with authentic expressions of faith, and how these two concepts interact with Scriptural translation would have made this book more valuable. As it stands, Sanneh's theology of the Word apparently excludes the concept of maturing in the faith and thus theological training.Also, Sanneh is illogical in his comparison of Muslim and Christian mission efforts in Africa. Sanneh had argued throughout Translating the Mission that Christian missionary effectiveness is directly correlated with translating the Scripture into the vernacular. He then argues that Islam also spread, albeit with a refusal to translate the Koran into the vernacular. Furthermore, Sanneh offers few insights into why this happened, limiting his research to proving that it happened. Although this reader appreciates Sanneh's academic integrity in presenting evidence that contradicts his thesis, he does not show the relationship between these contrasting-yet-successful mission paradigms. This reader now walks away questioning Sanneh's thesis and evaluation of the evidence.This book is helpful with regard to missiology in that it reinforces the idea that a person's upbringing and culture prepares a person to receive the Gospel and also influences his understanding of it. It is important for one to remind himself that God has given his people a diversity of gifts and experiences (personal as well as cultural). It is important for the Church to embrace a diversity of gifts while recognizing the Church's unity.Leadership transference is also an important message of this book. The Church depends on local and specialized leaders to be raised up, to take ownership, to make decisions, and to work toward unique, contextually relevant ends. Identifying new leaders (regardless of their culture) empowering, and supporting them is necessary for the ongoing mission of the church.This book is recommended."},{"Title":"Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture","review":"Translating the Message can be seen as a long historical reflection on Pentacost and its aftermath. The essence of how the Gospel relates to cultures lies in its \\"translatability,\\" Sanneh argues. Jesus spoke in Aramaic, but the records of his life are in Greek. At each stage of translation, missionaries tend to demand that hearers learn their own \\"civilized\\" ways along with the Gospel. But the nature of that message mitigates against this cultural presumption, so that when the Gospel has been translated, indigenous people find biblical support for their own independence from the missionaries and their (not infrequently imperialistic) culture.As Sanneh argues, while human beings may share foibles, in this respect Christianity contrasts sharply with Islam. The Koran was written in heaven in pure Arabic. Sanneh's point here is right on the mark: an Iranian friend of mine converted to Christianity partly because, when he went to Mecca, he was told that since his Arabic was so poor, he should divorce his wife! I'm not sure of the logic, but the upshot was that he recognized Arab culture as sautered to Islam. V. S. Naipaul's books describe how this works in places like Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. More and more, as education spreads and people want to read their sacred books directly, Muslims around the world are asked to become Arab.Sometimes Christians have made the same mistake. What Sanneh explains well here, is that despite our stupidity, the Gospel itself, both its content and the very fact that it is translated, eventually encourages a plurality of Christian cultures to spring up.If this pluralism matters so much, one reviewer asked, why has Islam also won the allegience of so many Africans? The 20% of Africans living north of the Sahara were converted in the initial military expanse of Islam. 25% or so of Africans live south of the Sahara, and converted over 1000+ years of military and economic expansion from that powerful northern base. Another 40% live south of the Sahara and have converted to Christianity, mostly in the past 150 years, mostly voluntarily. I think that pattern does show that affirming cultures is better than denying them, even as strategy: otherwise with its huge head start, one might have expected Islam to have easily swept through the rest of Africa.Quite a bit of the book deals with Africa, though Sanneh also talks about Greece, Europe, India, the Americas, and Japan a fair amount. Translating the Message can be read as a universal history of Christianity, from one particular perspective.My area of expertise is China and East Asia. My first book 15 years ago was called True Son of Heaven: How Jesus fulfills the Chinese Culture, so I've been thinking about these issues for a while. Sanneh doesn't talk about East Asia much, here, but what he says is interesting. A few characters who are especially fascinating in the light of his thesis, whom he either fails to mention, or says little of: the Nestorian missionary Jing Jing; Mateo Ricci (of course); the Jesuit missionary to Vietnam, Alexander Rhodes (an amazing and successful career, following Ricci's example, but great at friendship and at trusting Vietnamese); James Legge (the China translator par excellence); and John Ross, who read Legge and can almost be seen as the founder of the Korean church, though he lived in China. For those who are interested in my part of the world, I recommend you look into the lives of these remarkable men.My approach to Gospel and world cultures is through what I call \\"Fulfillment Theology,\\" which is more involved than translation, but Sanneh lightly touches on some of these deeper issues here, too.Sanneh is writing for an educated audience that is willing to invest time and thought into following his argument. He tends to repeat himself a fair amount, so if you skip a few pages, you won't miss his point, though you might miss a good example, or even a good story, some amusing. Some passages are a little top-heavy with abstract nouns, others flow smoothly, or achieve a sort of eloquence. Anyone can learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture","review":"In his revised work, \\"Translating the Message,\\" Lamin Sanneh, the professor of Missions and World Christianity and professor of History at Yale Divinity School, strengthens his argument that from the inception Christianity has identified itself with the need to translate itself out of Aramaic and Hebrew to contextualize its message to the diverse cultures and vernaculars of the world.The main purpose of this book is to show that Christianity is not a surrogate of Western Christianity, neither had it spread because of its European arm; rather it has powerfully advanced because of its inherent nature of translatability. In addition to combining \\"history and theology\\" to attest his thesis, Sanneh also shows the striking differences between two missionary religions-Islam and Christianity, and their contrasting attitudes in the aspect of translatability. He emphasizes on the Christianity's translatability over non-translatable Arabic Quran and its faith, not to put Islam down by comparison, but to emphasize his main argument. Some will certainly feel that Sanneh did not give a fair shot to Islam in this book. Author's European, Asian, especially, African perspective of \`mission and colonialism' have been very selective in making this book possible.Sanneh's thought, even some sentences are repetitive in the book. Neverthless, this book is not boring. This monumental work is very helpful for both western and non-western readers in understanding how Gospel has made at home in all world cultures from its beginning that no particular culture today can claim to be authoritatively Christian."},{"Title":"Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture","review":"\\"Translating the Message\\" is a worldview-transformational book. When first released, the message of the book was absolutely transformative. Contrary to the colonialist assumptions of many, Christian missionaries were not party to the exploitation of native populations.

When maybe they should have been reading Engle as well. I found this book to be a hidden/forgotten gem from a slightly earlier time. There is a passion in Engle's words that comes from what has been called a hard-scrabble existance. Holding a passion that seems the proper precursor to the 60's. As in, the events of the 60's would seem a weird answer to Engle's words as compared with a seemingly all around accepted answer to the 50's/60's beat writer's, Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, etc... Those upon whom the 60's were blamed or hailed. I mention the beats because there's a transition here, between the philosophies of the beats and what came prior, that was imoprtant. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Engle seems an important missing piece of that puzzle of the American beast. Published in 1936, prior to the beat movement. Engle has little to do with the beats, but as I've read other books of his poetry, his words often have much to do with our America. The past, as it pertains to the present. And his words can drift between ugliness and beauty almost within the same line. Engle's work bridges some gaps between a lot of post beat modern subjectivism poetry, and pre WWII era and victorian era poetry, as well as remaining completely current and valid, even if in resulting sentiment only. To understand Engle is to understand these times, for him good times, as a destination. Where many poets are able to be pigeon holed by the era their poetry was concieved, or relegated to the esoteric bins. Break The Heart's Anger was a fresh voice in a time when the nation needed to hear it. In my mind there is a sweet spot in America that begins sometime after the depression, and ends around the 1950's, early 1960's. Certainly some social issues excluded, but in many ways more positive and less complicated than the mania inducing Kennedy/Nixon era politics...Engle represents that prior time for me. When hope wasn't such a cheap word. And the world and future still seemed a big uncrowded place of possibility. What Steinbeck might sound like if he weren't so laid back lyrically, and wrote poetry instead of novels, or if Engle wrote Novels instead of poetry, he might sound like an observably passionate Steinbeck.

In my case, I happened across this book in the local bookstore the day I returned from my first exploration of the White Mountains and the Highway 395 corridor. Thumbing through it I realized it was a wealth of information to help me decipher the many plants and animals I had seen on my trip. It is an excellent compilation of nearly everything one is likely to encounter exploring this unique region. Whether it be geology, native vegetation, insects, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, or mammals, there is a chapter in here for each. And these are not simplified overviews of only the most common species, they are detailed discussions of numerous species and subspecies. Despite the detail, the writing style is easy to read. Each chapter is lavishly illustrated with black-and-white line drawings. A center insert also includes color photos of many arthropods and plant species.Though the focus is on the eastern slopes of the Sierras, it is often applicable to nearby areas. For instance it describes bristlecone pines found only in the White Mountains. The book also covers certain associated areas, most notably the surrounding desert communities.Genny Smith has done a wonderful job of coordinating the writing styles of many different authors. Having been involved in these types of collaborations myself, I know this is no easy task.

Unlike the other reviewer, I have seen the evolution of the book from The Deepest Valley and Mammoth Lakes Sierra to Sierra East. This is technically the 6th (?) edition. The original books were more of a travel guide. Thus, followers of Smith's books (I eagerly awaited each new edition) may be as sorely disappointed as I was.The &quot;Roadsides&quot; chapters were great for the less traveled byways of the eastern Sierra. The illustrations of the Sierra Crest were extremely useful as students always asked which peak is Lone Pine Peak (looks taller) vs Mt. Whitney. Illustrations like fig. 3.5 were scattered through this chapter. The chapter on trails were good for day hikes into the high country. Both of these chapters are now gone.I also miss the maps on the inside covers of the old editions.The present edition is part of the CA Natural History Guides, and Eastern Sierra follows the trend of massive books.The geology chapter is well done with good new illustrations, but the section of glaciers is shallow. This is one of the dominant feature of the eastern Sierra, yet the explanation is not as clear, mostly due to the lack of illustrations compared to the older. e.g. The description of a matterhorn is that it is named after the Swiss Matterhorn. No illustration. Cirque Lakes?Because it is a U.C. Natural History Guide, it tries to cover everything but nothing very well. It tries to be an all-in-one guide. Unless one is backpacking, it is sometimes wiser to have specific guides on specific groups of organisms. e.g. Number of eggs and incubation time are mentioned, but how many people see nests or have the time to watch how long it takes for the eggs to hatch. Maybe it would have been better to say &quot;watch for nighthawks at dusk just north of Bishop and south of the Bishop Tuff.&quot; I have seen more Ospreys in the Owens Valley than Prairie Falcons, Peregrine Falcons, Merlins, and Goshawks combined, yet ospreys get a few sentences. &quot;Look for them on Lake Tinemaha at the overlook.&quot;Most of the mammals described won't be seen unless one traps for them in very specific locations and habitats. A more detailed description on the diurnal mammals may have been in order.The fish chapter was expanded to include the various endemics, again fish that most will never see. Maybe a chapter or two on the fish hatcheries. Mt Whitney Fish Hatchery is great for kids (and grownups) to see huge trout that one can feed.I thought the arthropod chapter was good and restrained, covering things that people will encounter in the wilds... mosquitos, ticks, no-see-ems, and organisms that are important to the area... Pandora moths, bark beetles. Things that people run across... velvet ants, brine flies.I thought the flora section was ok. There could have been better comparisons between some of the more similar trees. Illustrations of the bark would have been nice, as they are helpful in identifying trees.Last, the water chapter is good but does not delve into the LA Aqueduct issue, Owens Lake, Mono Lake, etc.In Smith's defense, maybe the problem is that I am a biology professor and know the flora and fauna. I know less about the history and geology of the area."},{"Title":"Sierra East: Edge of the Great Basin","review":"Genny Smith has edited and contributed to an outstanding natural history guide of the eastern Sierra.

Paul Ehrlich envisioned a horrific future with mass starvation of millions, if not billions of people by 1995. As we now know, Ehrlich was a Malthusian of the worst order, and almost single-handedly gave environmentalists a bad name. He is the epitome of an alarmist who has significantly harmed the ability of reasonable environmentalists to be taken seriously (The Boy Who Cried Wolf Syndrome). I'm sure Dr. Ehrlich meant well, but boy, was he wrong. This book should rest in peace, never to be read again. Or, perhaps it could be read as a lesson learned in how to avoid making extremist statements that make you and your colleagues look stupid."},{"Title":"The Population Bomb (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"I was required to read this pap in high school. I'm astonished this book could even be in print. It is the height of hubris of a tenured professor. I wonder if those people giving it a positive review are bothered by every prediction being wrong or even know who Malthus was. It is a sad indictment of our educational institutions that they fail to teach students to acually think. Instead they regurgitate disproven ideas by the likes of Malthus, Keynes and Ehrlich. I recall seeing a Time Magazine list of the worst books of the 20th century and this book made it.In 1980 economist Julian Simons made a $1000 bet with Ehrlich. They picked precious metals and Ehlich bet in 10 years the price would go up vs down. At the end of 10 years Ehrlich wrote a check for more than $400 which the victor promptly framed and hung on his wall. Of course being tenured Ehrlich need not be right. Today he is an oracle for anthropogenic global warming, another discredited whacky idea. Read this book if you want to experience an intellectual moron or have read everything from Stephen King and like cheesy horror. In closing, it was a really lousy thing for my duluded teacher to have me under a cloud of dread for years. Had she instead directed me to read Malthus it would have been easy to see he was historically wrong. Paul Erlich has made a career of being wrong and scaring people.

It should be noted that he has substantially revised his predictions in later books such asThe Population Explosion,Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future, etc.(It should also be noted that he admittedly lost his 1980 bet with conservative economist Julian Simon, about the trend of prices for certain metals.)To be sure, his tone in this book was unduly \\"alarmist\\"; and his proposal to create a \\"stable optimum population size for the United States\\" (Pg. 135) certainly didn't anticipate the dramatic \\"Green Revolution\\" increases in agricultural production that would happen in the 1970s and later. His recommendation for \\"Proselytizing Friends and Associates\\" (e.g., praising childless people for their \\"selfless devotion to mankind\\" on pg. 185; telling families with two children that \\"two is plenty\\") seems almost ludicrous, in light of decreasing birth rates, later marriage dates, etc. His appeal to a variant of Pascal's Wager in the last chapter (\\"In other words, play it safe. If I'm right, we will save the world. If I'm wrong, people will still be better fed...\\") likely leaves us shaking our heads.However, a \\"reality check\\" is in order. People ARE starving in the world---the Sub-Saharan African countries, India, etc.---and population control is definitely a part of the solution in such areas.Ehrlich's book is still worth a read to gain \\"perspective\\"---but his later books are more useful, and they need to be balanced by also reading people like Julian Simon."},{"Title":"The Population Bomb (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"This is a classic book, and actually foretellsalot of the problems we have in the world today.

What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery.

This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does.

Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life.

The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques.

Dorian Gray did and didn't regret it.So what's the moral of the story? Indulgence and youth and beauty -- these are things that really matter in life.Good book. Bad moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems?

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is.

Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post.

The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point?

Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months.

I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND OUT THAT HE WROTE OTHER KINDS OF LITERATURE TOO. BUT THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF HIS WORKS.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books.

The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being.

However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway.

I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel!

Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book.

He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available.

I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed.

I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me.

It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read.

Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian.

That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was.

Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray.

His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

There seems to be an omission of detail, leaving one to imagine what terrors the protagonist commits that leads to the life he takes in."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read.

While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think. The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing.

Read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"For the past several years, I continually heard the name \\"Dorian Gray\\". As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde.

Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant.

It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised.

He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff.

Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination.

But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking.

This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?

This is a book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality.

To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware.

Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages.

Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Art for art's sake? Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book.

In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied.

I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey.

At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century.

The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school.

Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production.

This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it.

He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant.

A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good.

Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources. I heartily recommend this edition for readers seeking a scholarly edition for research purposes.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked.

Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul.

He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished.

This is a classic that one should truly make time to read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it!

This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.

It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul.

Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away.

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did.

You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions.

Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth.

Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated. And if you ever need a quick comeback, quoting Dorian Gray will throw off most anyone. And if it doesn't, perhaps you will have a new friend!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is going to have to be one of the best books I read this whole year.

What a fun read!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so.

It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it.

The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about.

He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time.

A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wow.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read.

The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think.

I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"which is a waste of paper.

Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.

It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since.

Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature. But all of these writers take their cues from Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice.

A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools.

His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time. I finished it in one day, because I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book, and all other Oscar Wilde works for that matter."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a Faustian novel, and one of the first ground-breaking pieces of gothic literature along with novels such as \\"The Castle of Otranto\\" by Horace Walpole and \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" by Anne Radcliffe. Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The story is pretty standard.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?'

I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it.

It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism.

The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde's workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \\"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It arrived very quickly.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

It just never seemed like she had any qualities that made her stand out from the rest. Well, I was wrong! In this book, you see a totally different side of TJ. For one thing, she seems to have a naughty side and she also seems extremely mixed up. In her situation, who wouldn't be?

Mindy knows about her \\"real\\" mother because she still has some memories of her.

I also recomend reading the first three in this series if you haven't read them yet."},{"Title":"Like Gold Refined","review":"Like many of Oke's readers, I have followed the saga of the Davis family in the Love Comes Softly Series and now The Prairie Legacy. Like Gold Refined, the conclusion to the Prairie Legacy series, continues the story of the Davis's grandaughter Virginia. In the first three books of the series, readers saw Virginia mature from a flighty teenager to a caring young wife and mother. In Like Gold Refined, Virginia's path to maturity continues as she has to accept the physical changes in her aging grandparents, Clark and Marty Davis. She does not want them to grow old, to leave their farm, or to change anything in their lives. Her mother Belinda has accepted these changes and makes plans to deal with them, but Virginia wants to hang on to the past, keeping everything the same. When Virginia and her husband Jonathon have to suddenly deal with a court battle over their &quot;unofficially adopted&quot; daughter Mindy, Clark and Marty's problems take a back seat to their own setbacks. Over the ensuing months, Virginia and Jonathon travel to the city, leaving their young family, battle with judges and lawyers, and risk losing their livelihood as they go in to debt to pay legal fees. All the while, Virginia tries to maintain a normal household and keep things the same. Finally, it is Mindy who realizes that changes must be made and she makes the decision herself about where to live. After it is all over, Virginia explains to Mindy that some things are meant to change, and that it is all in God's plan. Through her own journey with Mindy and their problems, Virginia finally realizes and accepts that her grandparents are aging and must leave the farm. If not for the trials that Virginia suffered with Mindy, she would not have come to grips with the fact that even her grandparents' lives must change. Oke has done an excellent job with the two storylines, using one to bring about the resolution of the other. She has also come up with a fitting conclusion to the story of Clark and Marty, and has indeed shown the complete transformation of Virginia from a contented, yet carefree, housewife to a sensible young mother whose trials have formed her into a wise Christian woman, much Like Gold Refined."},{"Title":"Like Gold Refined","review":"&quot;Like Gold Refined&quot; was pre-advertized as perhaps the very last book of Janette Oke's in which her readers would hear of beloved Clark and Marty Davis. These two folks were first introduced to Oke's readers around 20 yrs. ago as a young, lonely couple-to-be in her very first book of the best-selling series, &quot;Love Comes Softly&quot;.Even though Loves Comes Softly officially ended with &quot;Love Finds a Home&quot;, the same family is picked up several years later when A Prairie Legacy was born. It is this four book series which is ending with &quot;Like Gold Refined.&quot; For this reason, I was both terribly excited and a bit hesitant to pick up the book, possibly ending forever the long, warm, family type relationship with a much loved family.Oke did a superb job of filling in several years between series and Virginia is a central character of this last 4 book group. She is the daughter of the Davis' daughter, Belinda Simpson, so she is their granddaughter.Now married and mother of four, Virginia lives with her husband Jonathan on a horse ranch near her extended family. Their oldest child, Mindy is adopted...unofficially. She was the baby of Virginia's dear friend, misguided and foolish Jenny, who simply decided her child would be in her way and would have a much better life with Virginia and Jonathan. So, as a fragile, neglected, unwanted three year old, she sort of &quot;defaulted&quot; to become the first child of then newlyweds Virginia and Jonathan Lewis. Mindy is around eight years old when this book opens.Virginia is having great difficulty accepting what age and time do to older folks. Her grandparents have always been a spiritual and emotional stronghold for her, and when she sees her mother, Belinda is very worried for their safety and independence, Virginia decides to refute this possibility by visiting herself. What she finds out is both shocking and heartbreaking to her.Little Mindy has not heard from her biological mother, Jenny, in many years. Virginia is both happy and sad. She is nervous and worried. What IF Jenny does come back? What IF? She is positive that she and Jonathan could never, ever give up their beloved oldest child. Therefore, she is startled when Mindy brings up the question, &quot;Did my other mommy love me&quot; to which no honest answer will be comforting.As Marty and Clark continue to deteriorate, finding suitable help for them is central in the life of Belinda. The coming of the telephone makes communication much easier, but something more needs to be done to protect her precious parents.At the heart of this book is an unexpected letter and visit from Jenny. Not only is she very, very ill with cancer, she drops the proverbial bomb on Virginia by stating she is taking HER daughter home with her. Pandemonium sets in for Virginia, but Jonathan is much calmer and determined, and the next day announces to Jenny that she is NOT taking Mindy away. Cursing, yelling, screaming, threatening, Jenny leaves for home without the daughter who doesn't even know her mother, or frankly, even care. Will legal negotiations become necessary? Jonathan is prepared to go all the way, no matter what it costs them.It costs them dearly. They are able to survive the first round of court and attorney costs which gave them their wishes....Mindy stays with them. But, the cost has been dear, and they are forced to pare down and postpone their dreams. But they have the most important thing, their daughter. Or, do they?Another letter, another court fight. This one is sure to bankrupt this little family. But in the middle of this second battle, little Mindy drops a bomb of her own. Ten years old and sensitive, she walks into the room, overhearing a conversation so carefully kept from her in the past. Learning that her mama wants her (needs her?), she begins to feel she must go live with her. She must tell her about God before she dies. Devastated but honest, Jonathan and Virginia try to start the adjustment of life without their much loved oldest child.The conclusions of this book, the outcome of Mindy's life, Jenny's life, Virginia and Jonathan's life, and the finale for Clark and Marty Davis makes this a must read wrap -up for these dear, dear friends if only in the pages of a book.

Rarely has such a family impacted so great a reading audience."},{"Title":"Like Gold Refined","review":"Once I started this one, I couldn't put it down. In typical Oke style, she had me feeling the pain and joy of Virginia and her growing family as they go through the most difficult of times.

The plot thickened with each child born to Marty and Clark. I connected with Marty the wife, Marty the mother, and Marty the grandmother. Then when Belinda [Marty's baby girl] gave her inheritance away and went back home without one thing to assist her aging Mom and Dad, I was appauled. I just finished Like Refined Gold, the last novel in the saga of Marty and Clark's family, The Prairie Legacy, starring Virginia, their granddaughter, Belinda's daughter. I love the rock solid faith portrayed in this inspirational fiction and how true to life Janette Oke portrays the hearts of wives, daughters, and grandmothers.

It was a depressing read, with few bright spots. I like my books to have a happy ending, or, at least, a somewhat happy ending, with things tied together especially when it's the conclusion of a series. \\"Like Gold Refined\\" was haphazard with a sloppy end.Maybe it is because I have a health condition which gives me moodswings, moodswings that I was experiencing during the read, but the book just left me depressed. Jenny was a beloved character, at least to me, from the start. It seems as if she was often times used as a symbol of evil, to teach us a lesson, rather than a main character of the series - confliting. SEMI - SPOILER: I was very unhappy by Jenny's painful end. Even though she found God before the end, I wanted to see her take hold of her life, and thrive. This book gives the false impression that if you turn from God, He will punish you. That is not true of God. Also, it gives the impression that if you trust in God, He will lift your burdens. At the same time, the auther is trying to express that life is diffifult - another conflicting message. We KNOW life is difficult. We don't need a book to remind of us of that. My illness has made my life exceedingly difficult, and prayer has not eased that burden. I continue to have faith because there is no alternative.One thing I did like was that Virginia's struggles were also at times almost too tough for her to bear, though she still just had this air of perfect housewife throughout this and the previous book. Her solid foundation makes life easier for her than many of us, but I would have liked to see her be more human, like in \\"The Tender Years.\\" The huge amount of problems she encountered in this book and the previous are unrealistic which makes her relatively smooth reaction to them also unrealistic. I know it's just a book, but I thought from reading other Oke books that her writing skills were above this. All in all, I was completely unimpressed and depressed by this dismal read."},{"Title":"Like Gold Refined","review":"If I could rate this book higher I would!! Janette Oke has long been a favorite author of mine. I have read most all of her books with her &quot;Love Comes Softly&quot; series my all-time favorite. I was thrilled to see her begin a new series with the granddaughter of Clark and Marty. But when I read the first book several years ago, I was less than enthused. Recently I saw this had become &quot;The Praire Legacy&quot; series, so I re-read Book 1 and continued with the series. Once again, these books are heartwarming and should be cherished forever. In &quot;Like Gold Refined&quot; we see Virginia as a young wife and mother coping with life changes ... not always easy. Along with the ups and downs of everyday life comes a bitter and hard-fought custody battle over Mindy, the daughter of Virginia's childhood friend Jenny. Mindy has lived with Virginia and Jonathon since she was a toddler when Jenny leaves her with the young couple. I was gripped by the story and was inspired not only by Virginia's faith through these circumstances but moreso with little Mindy's strong faith to bring her wayward Mama Jenny to the Lord. I experienced so many emotions, from laughing,crying, comfort and anguish. I rejoiced at the conclusion. It is my hope that Janette Oke will continue on with Mindy's story (possibly a new series of books). Thank you for blessing our lives with the story of Clark and Marty and their many offspring."},{"Title":"Like Gold Refined","review":"Again ... love this author and thoroughly enjoy all of her series ...

One of my favorites is called &quot;speak-write&quot;. With this method the teacher reads or speaks a small amount of information. Then the speaker is silent for about a minute.

This gets the students actively involved. It is also a precursor to teaching students how to take notes. Some middle-school teachers get angry when students are writing while they talk.

I thought the authors did a good job of organizing the speech and assigning words to the most probable speakers...only in one or two places did I prefer the KJV arrangements. The commentary was very informative, although I respectfully disagree on a few points, as I tend to a more conservative Christian approach to the text. My view is that, while obviously singing the praises of human sexuality, you cannot avoid some sort of allegorical/symbolic approach to this book. While the Bible is not anti-sexuality, nor would it ideologically be against healthy portraits of sexuality in righteous contexts, the book's presence in the canon of Scripture demands us to look for a prophetical meaning in the text. The Jews have seen it as an allegory of God's love for Israel. The Church has seen it as an allegory of Christ's love for the Church. Understood rightly, it is BOTH! The Shulamite is Israel, yes, but Israel was divided between the northern kingdom and the south. The norther kingdom of Ephraim eventually was lost and assimilated to the gentile world. I can't help but see the way in which the Shulamite is described as being a portrait of Ephraim. It is as if Solomon represents the greater son of David, the Messiah, who goes out among the nations and falls in love with Ephraim of old and brings her back. It is my view that Ephraim today is represented in the gentiles who have become Christians. Consider that most of the spices used to describe her are foreign imports, and many of the geographical places used to describe her are in the north. She is dark and lovely, like the tents of Kedar. She is foreign and exotic, like a mare in Pharoahs chariots. She is contrasted with the daughters of Jerusalem, who would be the southern kingdom who stayed faithful to the house of David."},{"Title":"Song of Songs: A New Translation With an Introduction And Commentary","review":"In all honesty i had high hopes for this book,i was mildly disapointerd at the lack of real vision.Though true to its calling (NEW TRANSLATION)it doesnt go beyond updating the song into the language of the day.I did however like the fact that they used hebrew lettering on the opposite page of the english trans, verse by verse.I would recomend this book to one who wants to speculate,disect,and tinker with the greatest love poem ever.Could have had more pictures/illustrations for readers to visualize this visualy intensive poem."},{"Title":"Song of Songs: A New Translation With an Introduction And Commentary","review":"Reading &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; directly out of the Bible and reading the work of Ariel and Chana Block is a complete different experience.

The layout is very user-friendly, with the original Hebrew on one side, with the English translation on the other. Anyone who knows or is studying Hebrew will appreciate this feature. Also the Song jumps between voices and narration without the typical \\"he said\\"/\\"she said\\" obtrusions that are common to modern writing. Using context clues it is not too challenging to figure out if the lines belong to the Lover or the Beloved, but the translators' use of italics and bold, makes this distinction clear and renders a very smooth reading.What makes this translation supreme is Bloch and Bloch's great command of Biblical Hebrew combined with their artistry in maintaining the poetic beauty of this text. They took great care to translate this text as closely as possible to the original Hebrew, but still made some artistic adjustments when a too literal translation would be awkward.This edition includes a wonderful introduction which discusses the various historical interpretations of this text, as well as their own take. A detailed commentary follows which explains in minutiae the justifications for various translation decisions. For example the word \\"love\\" in 5:1, Bloch and Bloch argue has in Hebrew really the specific meaning of \\"love-making\\" as opposed to other Biblical terms for love such as the NT Greek \\"philos,\\" or \\"agape,\\" or the OT Hebrew \\"chesed\\" all of which can have meanings quite different from the act of coitus implied in \\"love-making.\\" But the Blochs are careful to point out that the same Hebrew word used for love in 5:1 is used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, and in those instances is very clearly in the context of romantic lovers spending the night together.The Bloch translation manages to capture the mystery, the beauty, the sensuality of the language, in a way that is fresh, readable, and true to the Hebrew."},{"Title":"Song of Songs: A New Translation With an Introduction And Commentary","review":"My comment is not about the Song of Songs, nor do I write to praise this beautiful translation. I write to complain about this Modern Library edition, which is inferior in two ways to the edition published by the University of California Press. First, the University of California edition contains the entirety (two pages) of the authors' Acknowledgments. Since this is what we would routinely expect, it would not be worth mentioning, except for the fact that the Modern Library edition omits the first page almost entirely: this first page is completely blank except for the word \\"Acknowledgments.\\" Upon turning this page, the reader encounters the second page of the Acknowledgments, the text merrily rolling along in midstream and mid-sentence. I believe this happened because standards of proofreading today are so low, with some famous publishers considering proofreaders expendable. Second, the University of California Press edition is printed on high-quality paper; this makes for a pleasant reading experience, because when reading one side of a page the reader does not have to contend with text bleeding through from the other side. Again, this is so taken for granted that it would not be worth mentioning, except for the fact that the Modern Library edition is printed on cheaper, thinner paper, so that the text from the other side of the page does bleed through. This is yet another reflection of the lowering of standards by publishers who once stood for quality. Modern Library, modern times."},{"Title":"Song of Songs: A New Translation With an Introduction And Commentary","review":"The Blochs' translation is concise, elegant, and strikes the right balance between contemporary explicitness and classical reserve. Some of the textual choices are debatable, and the translation often departs from literalness, sometimes omitting entire lines -- but the overall result is fresh and exciting; this nuanced rendition really brings the Song to life.One thing to be aware of is that, other than the poem itself, a brief introduction, and some brief remarks by Robert Alter, the text consists mostly of very detailed translators' notes analyzing the verses line by line, even word by word. This material will be of interest to scholars of ancient Hebrew but perhaps not to the general reader. I read the book (sans notes) in about forty minutes -- and I have to wonder if I should have paid [amt] for the privelege.

In that split moment before tears begin to well. Before pain is translated into reaction. Or desire hits the brain. No wonder the Song flaunts such a pure animal presence. The lovers living between the heartbeats. I can see the Shulamite stealthing around the city at night. Silent, almost rolling, footsteps. The lovers collision always in the softlight of dawn.

Most of the lines are hers and she is more forceful than her lover. the two of them live in an earthly paradise, thriving in nature, exulting in their youthful sexuality.Later of course, the rabbis justified this book's inclusion in the biblical canon by pretending it was an allegory of love between God and the Jewish people or the Jewish people and the Torah. Christianity saw it as an allegory of the love between Jesus and the church or somesuch nonesense.This translation casts aside these perversions and reclaims this wonderful celebration of human sexuality for what it is.

For this is a day when the exchange of information is at an all time high. This is a day when information concerning historical and cultural context is at a maximum, but perhaps more than anything, this is a day, when the paradigms have shifted enough to make women real people, and the exploration and revelation of physical passion within the pages of the Scriptures, a real possibility.The power of this book, both as translation, and commentary is that it is so free of religious prejudice, prudery and preconception. Religious preconception in translation always and everywhere prevents God from getting through to where people live in language and imagery that they/we can understand. In short, religious preconception is the greatest enemy of divine conception. The two authors, have done everything in their power to allow the Scripture to say what it was meant to say, say it with passion, and in a way that anyone who has ever lived and loved can understand.So far from bringing just another pious agenda to the task, they have done all that they could to dismiss such a possibility, exploring just about every possible reason for this book's inclusion in the cannon of Scripture, except the possibility that God put it there in order to communicate a love that transcends the physical. This is to say, that the authors are so carnally minded in the highest sense of the word, that their motives are pure, and so is their translation. It finally allows the creation to do what Romans One tells us it was designed to do from the beginning, particularly in the creation of male and female.Written necessarily from a very Jewish perspective, how else could there be such delicious understanding of the sensual aesthetics and economy of the Hebrew poetic form. Their translation finally provides us with the bedrock of passion that the New Testament tells us was written down for our instruction on whom the end of the age has come.More than this, they have allowed us to have the foundational clues so necessary to unlock the great mystery of the Scriptures, which is that they are all about Christ, the Christ who is incomplete without His Church. At last armed with what He has truly said, perhaps we can discover what He is truly after. For surely this has been a great mystery, Christ and His Church. Now she might fully know the intention that she had in the heart of her lover on the day He said, &quot;I love you&quot; from the tree.Jay Ferris - September, 2000"},{"Title":"Song of Songs: A New Translation With an Introduction And Commentary","review":"This translation has some problems.

The subject is love, love for a woman and love for a man. It is the love song of two lovers.It is never erotic or pornographic, but always poetic. That is probably why it was used over and over again by composers in vespers dedicated to the Holy Virgin, particularly the first poem : I am black but lovely, daughters of Jerusalem with the famous songs Nigra sum and Pulchra es .This book has always been considered by the Catholics as an emanation of King Solomon and as prophecy about the coming of Jesus, about the Holy Virgin.It is of course possible to see a metaphor in that lovesong, the Bride being Israel, the people of God, who have neglected their vineyard and were punished for it, who have sinned and are now repenting after the fair punishment. Then the Bridegroom is God himself.But what remains - above and after all - is the marvellous poetic language to describe love and the loved ones. It is probably the Book that demonstrates best the fact that the Bible is speaking of real men and women and not of unreal, virtual ones.

It is not, however, an introduction to Hegel, and presupposes a fairly clear grasp of the themes and methods of the Phenomenology of Spirit and of Hegel's systematic philosophy as a whole.The project of the book is to clarify the project of the Phenomenology, its relation to Hegel's systematic philosophy as a whole and its abiding relevance today. Forster meticulously lays out the various different \\"official\\" and unofficial projects that Hegel set for himself in writing the Phenomenology of Spirit, and the ways in which these projects have been construed and misconstrued both by Hegel's contemporaries and by subsequent scholars. Throughout, his aim is not to demonstrate that Hegel's book fulfilled each of these tasks, but to show that the tasks make sense, that they are not in an essential conflict with each other, that they have historical precedents, that a case can be made for Hegel's having fulfilled these tasks, and that his various remarks about these tasks are both reasonable and coherent. His strategy here is a good one, since while it may be easy to pick holes in a particular interpretation of Hegel's text, it is hard to dispute Forster's demonstration that Hegel's various claims about the book are not obviously wrong or incoherent -- and that those commentators who have claimed they are have been unable to produce a convincing case for their contentions. The outcome of Forster's book is to pave the way for a new generation of scholars to approach Hegel's text charitably as at least potentially fulfilling the tasks that Hegel outlined for it. (I was surprised, for example, to find myself convinced by Forster's demonstration that a plausible case can be made for taking seriously Hegel's various suggestions that the first five chapters from sense-certainty to reason can be read as a roughly chronological history of the epistemology of consciousness -- from ancient Persian and Egyptian religious \\"epistemology\\" to German idealism -- in addition to their logical role in accounting with increasing sophistication for what actually takes place in cognition and experience).Perhaps most importantly, he makes a strong case that while some of these tasks are relative to the period of time in which Hegel was writing (which explains why even Hegel himself put less emphasis on the importance of the work as he came to believe that some of its aims had already been fulfilled), at least one central project of the work remains a viable and important philosophical project even today: the task of demonstrating the viability of a Hegelian approach to systematic philosophy by demonstrating such an approach to emerge naturally from the contradictions implicit in alternative and natural but non-systematic approaches to understanding the world.This is not the book to turn to as a newcomer to Hegel -- there are better introductions to Hegel (see Houlgate's Introduction to Hegel and Russon's Reading Hegel's Phenomenology), and in general the best place to start is in a class with an instructor who is generally sympathetic to Hegel and can talk you through some of the difficulties. Still, it might not be a bad place to start for an advanced student of philosophy whose reluctance to take Hegel seriously (or take a seminar on Hegel) stems from an inheritance of myths and prejudices that Forster helpfully analyses and challenges. It is, however, an enormously important contribution to Hegel scholarship that, along with many other recent works on Hegel that have helped create a \\"renaissance\\" of Hegel studies in the last twenty years or so, should help to lay to rest a number of artificial concerns and misconceptions about Hegel's project that stand in the way of a proper grasp of what is probably the most important and perennially relevant works of one of the most important and influential thinkers."},{"Title":"Hegel's Idea of a Phenomenology of Spirit","review":"It is amazing how someone can write so clearly about such and an obscure book. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit has unfortunatly been dismissed by many as simple foolishness. Forster's book, however, is excellent at destroying this view. Put Hegel's Phenomenology on one knee and this book on the other. When you read Hegel you forehead will crinkle up and you will stare blankley at pages. &quot;Huh&quot; Then reading Forster, your forehead will relax &quot;Oh, I see&quot; The combination of the two makes for a great journey into the realm of new and exciting ideas. Forster has allowed me to appreciate the great mind of Hegel that otherwise would have remained unknown to me. Outstanding book."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"This book tells of a triple murder that it took almost 50 years to prosecute. Actually, you will get insights into three different sequences of Chicago-area murders - different, but all strangely intertwined. The main theme of \\"Shattered Innocence\\" is the 1955 murders of the Schuessler/Peterson boys. However, it turns out that the same circle of perpetrators were probably also responsible for the disappearance/murder of candy heiress Helen Brach. Furthermore, it seems likely that John Wayne Gacy could have known the Schuessler brothers and Bobby Peterson. This book reveals that Gacy was circulating in these boys' neighborhoods as a notorious, slightly older bully in the 1950's. A few maverick police investigators are even convinced that Gacy was their killer. The authors briefly discuss this theory.You might be surprised to learn how much of this evil emanated from the various riding stables that ringed the NW suburbs of Chicago in those decades. The stables seemed to have attracted some of the most unsavory elements around the City. This criminal coterie centered around Silas Jayne, sometimes referred to as \\"The Godfather of the Horse Mafia.\\" It included a host of other stable owners, stable workers, and horse traders who formed a shifting, unholy alliance operating on the outskirts of the \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" society that we normally associate with 1950's middle America. This inbred fraternity specialized in selling worthless horses to the wealthy at inflated prices, in burning down properties for insurance profit, and in manipulating some of the youngsters who came out to the stables to work around horses into granting sexual favors to the older men in charge of the properties.The early chapters of \\"Shattered Innocence\\" present a detailed reconstruction of the three victims' movements on the day of their deaths. There is in fact a lot of detail included here. Specific addresses and business names abound. These references can evoke a welcome nostalgia among those raised on the NW side of Chicago in the fifties. \\"Ah yes, the Monte Cristo Bowling Alley, Kiddieland,...\\" However, even those who have no connection with Chicago might not mind this depth of detail. The result is like a pointillist painting of a time and place.The book loses its way a little at midpoint. A lot of unsubstantiated charges and claims are trotted out. At least one bombshell confession is tossed onto the pages out of the blue, and an important piece of evidence about the location of the boys' scattered clothing isn't mentioned until near the end of the book. The thread of chronology sometimes gets tangled. However you'll probably find your interest is recaptured in the later chapters when, in the mid 1990's, someone is finally charged with the crime, and parts of his trial transcript are reproduced.There are some frustrating gaps in the narrative though. The book is vague about how it was thought one man could subdue three lively boys. But most frustrating of all - I never felt I really got to know the victims. Why were the boys so flagrantly ignoring their parents' curfew? They had generally been depicted as true products of the \\"Beaver\\" idyll. Why then were they still ranging around well past the hour they'd promised to be home - trying to board buses or cadge rides in the pouring rain, to destinations farther and farther removed from their own neighborhoods? The book's generally circumspect silence on this point might have been maintained out of respect for the boy's surviving relatives. There had been some suggestion that these youths were engaged in what was a cruel and unsavory, but fairly common way for youngsters to make money then. They might have been \\"fruit-picking\\" - that is, blackmailing members of the gay community.Then too, the authors somewhat exaggerate the impact this crime had on Chicago in particular, and on society in general. Probably to add a fever pitch of drama and importance to their narrative and to enable readers to pore over the details of the crime, not as voyeurs, but as students of societal change - the authors claim these murders were pivotal in changing parenting styles and in ushering in a permanent atmosphere of suspicion and even panic. However when I talked to people who'd grown up on the NW side of Chicago in that era, none reported having noticed any change in their daily routine in the wake of these crimes. They said that while they'd heard of these awful crimes, they had still walked to school and played unsupervised outdoors until past dusk. So the book's title contention might be viewed as a bit of hyperbole.However, this is overall an interesting, eye-opening account. It's written in a kind of Chicago \\"Da Bears\\" home-speak. Even the occasional typos and odd locutions make you feel as if you are gumshoeing along with a bunch of old Chicago workingmen pros. The English is basic with the occasional grab for a more academic word that's hanging just out of reach. For example, on the very first page, the authors introduce one of the men who became a lead detective on the cold case by saying, \\"After twenty-seven years in law enforcement and a lifetime of working the streets, Delorto's feelings for Chicago were diametrical.\\"Be sure to read through the extensive notes in the back of the book. Most of these stand on their own, providing additional insights and review. Then you'll probably be motivated to fill in the gaps in this book by checking out other books on this and other notorious Chicago crimes."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"I typically avoid books where the only reviews on the dust jacket come from other authors (as opposed to newspaper and magazine critics whose reputations are on the line) and certainly wish I had followed my instincts with this one. \\"Shattered Sense of Innocence\\" is an incredibly long, detailed, confusing and, above all, boring ramble about the killing of three boys in 1955 Chicago that is much better recounted in \\"Unbridled Rage\\"--a book that, interestingly, the authors do not cite as source material. \\"Shattered\\" lacks continuity and focus and I found it all but impossible to stay interested. The authors apparently dedicated their efforts to ensuring that every single fact they unearthed, no matter how esoteric, found its way into the narrative and this makes for a book that reads more like a droll textbook (hence the publisher, I suppose) than what should be an interesting \\"true crime\\" work. In addition, their constant harping on \\"innocence\\" (as in neighborhoods and 1950s Chicago) was something that I found to be very irritating--in fact, the book should have been titled \\"Shattered Sense of Security\\" because it was the sense of security that these neighborhoods lost, not innocence. One of the \\"reviews\\" on the cover calls this \\"the new 'In Cold Blood'\\"--that could only have been written by (a) a friend, (b) a family member, or (c) someone who never read Capote's classic. If you're interested in this case, pick up \\"Unbridled Rage\\"--it's much better written, more succinct, and you can actually understand the flow of events. With only 40 pages left to go, I couldn't take this one any more and tossed it in the trash. $29.95 down the drain, but the loss of the jack was less painful than continuing this punishing read."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"The book is an amazing murder mystery set against the backdrop of 1950's Northwest side of Chicago. The neighborhood tales and stories tell of a fascinating slice of the 1950's with accurate details, so that even if you are not a murder mystery buff, the book is still extremely interesting. The book carefully relates the bumbling, inept police work which is grossly inadequate due to the lack of forensic science development at the time, and most notably, DNA testing. Although tons of people power and money were thrown at the case, nothing much develops from all this into hard evidence. The only trial that took place was decades later and even that was based upon circumstantial evidence and weak confessions, although the reader was left with a sense at the end that justice was served. Perhaps the book is a bit choppy and many questions are left unanswered, but that is the crux of the entire book--the police work was choppy, fairly uncoordiated, major suspects and clues were not followed up on well, or even at all. So the book style follows the uneasiness of the police work, the uneasiness of a neighborhood left with a triple murder of 12 year old boys found naked, dead, with their lifeless bodies shown on the TV news that evening. But most importantly, the book is reveals stories, tales and legends and a style of life not really known outside the NW side of Chicago, but which can be easily appreciated by anyone. I believe most people would find that they simply cannot put the book down and will feel compelled to read it in a day or two. The writing is an excellent quality, and the investigative work was extremely good and very believable."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"The Schuessler-Peterson murders, the long unsolved deaths of 3 boys in 1955 Chicago, have inspired three books; \\"Unbridled Rage,\\" \\"Three Boys Missing,\\" and \\"Shattered Sense of Innocence.\\"All are highly recommended.

We spent hours discussing it. After fifty plus years, the triple homicide described in \\"Shattered Sense of Innocence: the 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children\\" is still chilling and disturbing. The book established a strong sense of time and place. The authors succeeded in recreating the fear and dread that gripped an entire community that will bother you long after you have finished reading. These things were not supposed to happen here, not in a quiet residential district bordering upon the suburbs.As a person who drives through the Jefferson Park/Norwood Park area of Chicago on a regular basis, it is impossible for me to pass certain intersections now without thinking of the three victims: that was the location of the police station where their parents looked for help; that was the bowling alley the boys visited; the three youths were last seen on that corner before accepting a ride from a passing vehicle.Portions of the immediate neighborhood are largely unchanged. The former police station on Gale Street is still standing, but it houses other city offices today as a newer and larger police headquarters has replaced it. The forest preserve opposite East River Road where the three naked bodies were discovered still draws stares from passing motorists who can remember the banner headlines and the startlingly graphic images broadcast on local television during the nightly news (the book contains these photo images). Some older adults can recall being kept inside their homes for several days by parents who were afraid to allow their children to play outside until the unknown criminals were arrested by the police.The initial police investigation was badly botched by the political hacks competing for jurisdiction over the crime scene. The murderer and his accomplices took care to dispose of the bodies in a location where multiple agencies and officials could quarrel over who was in charge of the investigation. For decades afterwards, the murders would remain unsolved. The determined efforts of an arson investigator seeking to determine who the culprits were in a series of fires at various riding stables set in motion the revival of the murder inquiry decades later and resulted in the controversial trial of the one the surviving suspect.The book contains some conjecture as to what transpired on that fatal night. Some facts can only be guessed at, but the authors review several theories and offer plausible interpretations of the possible chain of events. The actions of several of the now deceased accomplices can only be imagined.Be forewarned, this is not a pleasant book to read nor will it be easily forgotten once you have finished it. Readers will be introduced to sexual predators, petty thieves and pornographers who gather in amusement parks and recreation halls where children and teenagers loiter. There is danger to be found near the merry go round and the pony rides. Some of the smiling monsters walk amongst us in the bright sunshine, dressed in casual clothing and projecting a false facade of friendliness and respectability. The unspeakable evil committed in 1955 continues to reverberate today. I cannot begin to imagine how many lives were damaged by the accomplices and the perpetrators of these three murders."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my husband. He saw a write-up about it in the newspaper and wanted the book. We were kids ourselves when these murders happened. The price charged on Amazon was about 33% less than the book store and it arrived in less time than indicated. My husband has read the book and now my daughter is reading it. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"I've been an amazon customer for the longest, and have never written a review. I just couldn't pass up the chance of letting all potential readers know just how excellent and heart-felt this book really is. The story is a tragic one and these authors really nailed it because they lived it. I couldn't sleep for days.....i still cry when i think about it."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"I was the same age as these boys and living in the South Suburbs of Chicago when they were killed, so these murders left a great impression on me. I was in a barber chair when the news came over the radio that the boys' bodies and been found and identified. As the authors posit, I felt that the the familiar neighborhood streets were a lot different now as I scooted home from the barber shop. This is the second book about these murders that I have read--the excellent Three Boys Missing by James A. Jack being the other.This book is well-researched and, for the most part, excellently written with a strong narrative drive. Of course, I knew the outcome of the story, but, nonetheless, it remained \\"a page-turner\\" for me. Most of the new revelations in this book concern the \\"solution\\" to the 40-year-old case: the apprehension and ultimate conviction of Ken Hansen. For me, this is a very startling aspect of this book. I'm not sure that Ken Hansen is the killer and the fact that many people do not believe the State's Attorney's case against Hansen was a strong one upsets me. It seems as if the prosecution's case rests solely on Hansen's telling nefarious friends/acquaintances that he did the deed. After 40+ years he was convicted on heresay and his deplorable life-style with very little direct evidence linking Hansen to the murders. Yet, two separate jurys handed down the verdict of guilty. Unfortunately, the verdicts reminds me a lot of Stalin's Russia so well-depicted in the recent novel Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith where heresay and fear control the judicial system."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"For nearly 40 years the murder of three Chicago boys, Robert Peterson, 13, John Schuessler, 13 and John&#8217;s younger brother, Anton, 11, in October, 1955, had remained a mystery. Their naked bodies had been found in a ditch in the Robinson&#8217;s Woods Forest preserve, dumped like unwanted trash. It was a crime that rocked Chicago and the nation. But after several years and thousands of man-hours of police investigations following clues and tips and interviewing thousands of suspects, the unsolved murders had grown as cold and dead as the three boys. Then, in October, 1991, ATF Agent James Delorto, who was investigating the disappearance of candy heiress Helen Brach and her connection to Silas Jayne, the treacherous godfather of &#8220;Chicago&#8217;s Horse Mafia,&#8221; received a surprise phone call from a confidential informant, a &#8220;snitch&#8221; named William &#8220;Red&#8221; Wemette. Wemette, a former Chicago pornographer, let slip that Kenny Hansen, one of the people Delorto was investigating, had told him that he, Hansen, had murdered the three boys. Suddenly, the unsolved murders came roaring back to life.&#8220;Shattered Sense of Innocence,&#8221; in meticulous detail and care, chronicles the lives and last hours of the three murdered boys. It takes us to the places they were last seen alive and follows every clue, every suspect, every speculation as to who killed the boys and why. It tells the entire sordid story of the 1955 murders that &#8220;destroyed two families, more than a few careers, and the trust of a generation.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t hesitate to detail the incredible incompetence of police and crime scene investigators and the political rivalries between competing police jurisdictions and the county coroner&#8217;s office that virtually assured that the crime would never be solved. And while it lays blame on those that deserve it, it also honors those investigators who worked tirelessly for years to solve the cold case and to convict Kenny Hansen of the crimes.But this is more than just a study of a brutal, pedophilia tainted crime, it is also a study of criminal justice. &#8220;Shattered Sense of Innocence&#8221; asks the question: &#8220;Can defense attorneys mount a reasonable defense for a crime that occurred fifty years ago? And, when there is no physical evidence connecting the alleged murderer to the crime, can a conviction, based on the testimony of liars, thieves, arsonists and pornographers, be called justice? Not surprising, while the prosecutors believe they proved their case, defense attorneys and the Center for Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School believe Kenny Hansen was innocent.&#8220;This intensely intimate account offers a rare glimpse into one community and examines how three atrocious crimes altered public perceptions nationwide.&#8221; Published by Southern University Press, this 342 page, fully indexed and footnoted book, includes fifty illustrations of the gruesome crime scene and all the major players.Finally, a personal footnote. I grew up in Chicago. I lived in Irving Park, only a few of miles from where the Shuessler and Peterson kids lived. I had just turned 14 when these murders were committed. At the time I delivered the &#8220;Chicago Daily News&#8221; after school and my delivery route included the Monte Cristo and Drake Bowling alleys, two of the places the boys were last seen alive. My friends and I also used to go bike riding in Robinson&#8217;s Woods and sometimes horseback riding at Happy Day Stables, which was just down the road from the Idle Hour Stables where Kenny Hansen murdered the boys. So I have vivid memories of those places and of some of the characters the murdered boys also allegedly knew. Nearly sixty years later, it kind of creeps me out to realize how nave we were back then. Neither I nor any of my friends had any inkling of the dark and seedy underworld that existed in our so-called &#8220;safe neighborhood&#8221; on Chicago&#8217;s Northwest side. But now I do.If you are interested in this horrific crime, this is a supurb account of it and its aftermath and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson & Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)","review":"I have read several other books on this tragic case and A Shattered Sense of Innocence is the most comprehensive account to date.

That reviewer seems unsetteld because \\"no solution is offered\\" and seems to miss the point that an important nurturing and caretaking solution is offered.The solution being to meet your child where he is in his deveopmental fears and challenges, and to offer a safe haven first and foremost.( a haven of love, of humor, of compassion). The solution is to create a solid safe base so that the child can begin to feel secure enough inside himself to move beyond his fears and resistances. That is not done by a rigid \\"solution\\" but by trusting that you as parent are initiating a process. For me the pictures, rather than lacking depth and style, showed all the raw emotion that only this loosely penned style can accomplish."},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"As a parent, sometimes I get so tired of the perfect parents and kids in children's books. Don't you? Well, No Haircut Today! is a funny story with adorable pictures that's much more realistic about the day-to-day relationship between parent and child. It has a lot to say, in a very sweet and approachable way, about love, family, and compromise. Great for younger kids and their parents, too."},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"Recommended for children ages 2 to 6, No Haircut Today! is an entertainingly written and illustrated picturebook by Elivia Savadier, and tells the warm and charming story of a young, scraggly-haired boy who does not like to get his hair cut. When Dominic sees scissors, he screams! His mother is very upset. But she loves him, and even if he does not get a haircut today, he just might tomorrow! The simple story and the striking, free-form illustrations make No Haircut Today! a charming and memorable storybook for beginning readers."},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"My son loves this book! We read it the entire week before his first haircut. We use the \\"open\\" ending to fit our needs - we talk about how Dominic decides in the end to get a haircut and how he learns getting his haircut doesn't hurt. This book was a great find and my son continues to enjoy it, even after his first haircut."},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"I bought this book for my 2 and a half year old son. He has never had a haircut and is afraid to go. My hope in buying this book was that it would help him overcome his fear. However, the book did just the opposite since the little boy in the book is afraid to go as well. By the end of the book, the little boy is still afraid to go. I would have hoped that the opposite would have occurred. Cute book if you just want to read for fun but won't help your child overcome his fear of the first haircut. At least, did not for mine."},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"I disagree with your disagreement. No one asks for a rigid solution, just something that resembles a resolution, even if that means no solution. The book just sort of conveniently stops, without troubling itself with any suggestion of how one MIGHT deal with the sort of concrete issues that adults and children must face together. The really good books don't force feed you THE solution, right, but at least offer something that resembles more of a story, rather than vague comfort for adults about offering a secure place of safety. It's an ok book, but i've seen better, and we're all entitled to our thoughts about it!"},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","review":"Young toddler Dominic sports a smorgasbord of hairs on his head: Some of his hairs are straight, some curly; some are long, and some are short. One thing is certain, though, he \\"does not like to have his HAIR CUT.\\" Would-be barbers try some gimmicky salon chairs to lure Dominic to the scissors, but he does not yield: \\"NO!\\" he shouts.\\"If anyone tries to hold his headno matter how gentlyhe screams!This drama upsets his mother (who is a hair stylist herself), and Dominic wonders if she is mad at him. However, they each say \\"I love you,\\" and the somewhat beleagured looking mother decides that there will be \\"NO HAIRCUT TODAY!\\" (but, \\"maybe...tomorrow.\\")Dominic looks delighted rather than comforted, almost as if he got away with something...While not every book must have a message--and some do worse because they try to impart one--\\"No Haircut Today\\" seems unfocused. While I appreciate the flexibility shown by the mother, and the compassion for Dominic's dilemma, no solution is offered. The pictures lack depth and style (though the font changes are interesting), and that last shot of Dominic seems off. Perhaps this might be a nice story for rigid parents (if they're not offended at your gift) or haircut-phobic kids, but there's not much else going on here."},{"Title":"No Way to Treat a Lady","review":"THIS BOOK IS SIMPLY AND UNDENIABLY AMAZING. I've read No Way To Treat A Lady and it is and continues to be the best of his books yet. Goldman wrote this the way every book should be written; he allowed the characters to carry the story instead of letting the plot lead or get in the way of the characters. He makes this book all about The Story and the roles the characters play within it. It's amazing, though, that it's the characters that bring the story to life. Even though it lacks the vivid descriptions and details about each person that most authors think imperative to a book, these characters capture our feelings, allowing us to imagine and create their character, thus allowing us to empathize with them.To be less scholarly, however, let me say that this book is also the funniest thing I've ever read (surprising as it's a murder mystery)! I laughed out loud at several moments. And I could NOT put it down! I read it in one sitting! I've given it to every one of my friends, who agree it's one of if not the best books they've ever read. It has so much witty dialogue - how could you NOT love that?!Goldman is an intelligent author and absolutely one of the best of our time. (He's also a screenwriter, which begs the question: WHY ISN'T THIS A MOVIE?!?) READ THIS BOOK! You will NOT regret it."},{"Title":"No Way to Treat a Lady","review":"I've read several William Goldman books and like his others, this one is an easy and fun read. However, I found some of his other books to be more engrossing (The Princess Bride, Marathon Man etc.) Still, this book about a serial killer on the loose in New York is a good read....creepy, scary and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"When I purchased this book, many, many years ago, I opened it to a random page and read a paragraph. I was drawn in immediately, which was an indication of its long-term appeal to me. Even though I have read it through twice over the years, I can pick it up, open it to any page, find it engaging, and experience the same eagerness to see how Jackson weaves the tale.I won't repeat the theme or plot here, you can find those in the other reviews on this page. That Don Birnam, the protagonist is an alcoholic is incidental to me, although some people will buy it for that reason primarily, having read how it changed people's views toward alcoholism. Some may buy it to compare it with the movie version. I have tried to analyze why Jackson's prose is so addictive for me. Perhaps it is because recent books strive too hard to be cool and suggest a world out there that the reader can only hope to experience vicarously, while Jackson describes everyday, mundane events and feelings with brilliance, with descriptions that make me say, \\"Hey, that happened to me!\\""},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"Jackson's autobiographical novel about a particularly devastating binge is one of the most accurate and haunting depictions of alcoholic destruction. While it's not as byzantine or poetic as \\"Under the Volcano,\\" the terse prose and hard-driving narrative seize the reader and take us on an unpleasant, but important journey."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"For years, \\"The Lost Weekend\\" has been one of my favorite movies of the 1940s. Ray Milland's oily style never seemed better suited than it did to the role of Don Birnam, the story's inveterate sneaking drunk, and the movie was-- and remains-- surprisingly hard-hitting for a film of that period. I also promised myself for years that I would read Charles Jackson's book of the same title on which the movies is based, and I finally have. Jackson's book takes place entirely from the perspective of the main character, Don Birnam, and entirely inside that character's head. It contains relatively little action and dialogue (don't look for too many familiar scenes from the movie, especially that upbeat, optimistic ending), being mostly comprised of Birnam's endless introspection and rationalization of his self-destructive behavior, laced with undercurrents of homosexuality. This is never dull, however. Birnam is an intelligent, sharp, and very entertaining fellow, even if you can never trust him, and Jackson keeps you whipping right along, with only occasional lapses into literary and philosophical tedium. I have no biographical information about the author, but the story is told with such knowledge and insight that I would be very surprised if it is not, to some large extent, based on personal experience. This is a very thoughtful and penetrating read, which, I am happy to say, has not detracted from my enjoyment of the movie."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"For all the obeisance we pay to literature, it is remarkably rare for a novel to actually change, or help change, the culture. Nor is it necessarily, nor even likely, the &quot;serious&quot; books that effect the change. In terms of it's political impact, there may never have been a more important novel than Uncle Tom's Cabin, which is hardly the stuff of academic studies and literary criticism. Similarly, The Lost Weekend, though in many ways resembling nothing so much as a pulp fiction or a hardboiled noir, had a tremendous influence on American attitudes towards alcoholism and alcoholics, making it a surprisingly significant book.Charles Jackson's semi-autobiographical tale follows the &quot;promising&quot; writer Don Birnam for one four day weekend as he descends into the depths of alcoholic despair and debauchery. Birnam's overly protective younger brother, Wick, goes out of town, leaving Don on his own in their apartment, even though he fears that, as usual, Don will take advantage of his independence to go on a binge. Wick has tried to limit the damage by controlling Don's allowance, from a family trust, but Don has perfected all kinds of scams for getting more and as the weekend progresses he comes up with some new ones. These include everything from stealing a purse to a rather pitiful attempt to find a pawn shop that's open on Yom Kippur, to hock his typewriter. Finally, he even steals and pawns his girlfriend's fur coat after she, Helen, tracks him down and tries nursing him through a period of delirium.Besides the robberies from family, friends, and strangers, Jackson shows the effect of the drinking on Don's behavior towards others as he stands up a dinner date, takes advantage of a kindly local merchant, and unmercifully exploits Wick and Helen and their concern for him. He also shows the physical effects in Don's urgent need for drink, a brief stay at Bellevue (or a hospital very much like it) after falling down the stairs and fracturing his skull, and finally in the chillingly described delirium tremens and hallucinations.Books, movies, and television have all made alcoholism a staple theme, but when Jackson wrote this book alcohol was merely a comic device in literature, and alcoholism was taken to be a function of the liquor itself and of the spiritual weakness of the drunk. Much of the book anticipates future findings about the true nature of the disease. In the first place, Don is not a skid row derelict. He's a cultured and talented young man from a decent family. Nor is he simply beholden to the bottle; his alcoholism is just a manifestation of much deeper psychological problems, in his case either repressed homosexuality or fear of the very possibility. His downward spiral began in college after an incident involving a crush on a fraternity brother and he reacts with horror when a male nurse at Bellevue propositions him. Even if he were to stop drinking, Don Birnam would still be a profoundly troubled man, would still be desperately ill.Jackson also anticipates the concept of &quot;enablers&quot;, which is what the folks around Birnam really are. Wick and Helen obviously care about him, but their willingness to cover for him and their unwillingness to confront him makes them participants in the problem. They and Don are kind of archetypal examples of dysfunction as the drinking has become the core of his existence, shutting out any capacity to relate honestly with others, and they have been reduced to lying, to him and to themselves, and compensating for his behavior, essentially putting his drinking at the core of their lives too.In all of this Jackson was years ahead of his time. The book, which became a bestseller, and the excellent Billy Wilder film version, which studios were reluctant to make but which became a surprise hit and Academy Award winner, ushered in an era when attitudes towards alcoholism began to change and the hitherto hidden problem began to be addressed more honestly. But beyond this social impact, it's just a really good book, one that stands the test of time and which has probably never been bettered in its portrait of an alcoholic.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"I read \\"The Lost Weekend\\" after seeing the fine movie starring Ray Milland. The movie gripped me, and hit close to home, but I felt that there was a quality to the writing that made me seek out the book (which was out of print at the time). Boy, am I glad I did. \\"The Lost Weekend\\" is an absolute literary masterpiece, capturing a 5-day drunk from an inveterate alcoholic with such chilling accuracy that it actually becomes a suspense novel: there's a scene where the protagonist, Don Birnam, is struggling up 6th avenue to pawn his girlfriend's coat, so he can buy more booze, that is so nail-bitingly horrific that I had to put the book down several times and catch my breath.Charles Jackson has perfectly captured the madness, compulsion, fear, degradation of addiction and yet this book is unlike any other I've read about alcoholism--the only one that really rivals it is \\"A Fan's Notes\\" by Fred Exley, which is the *other* great masterpiece about drinking.For those of you who might be interested in seeing the flip side of this book, ie, \\"the horror of sobriety,\\" you might want to check out HALF EMPTY by Tim Hall, which chronicles the madness, fear, and antagonism of early sobriety in much the way this captured the horror of hardcore alcoholism."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"This is, first and foremost, an addiction tale. It is a meditation on what alcohol does to the mind, the body, the spirit, and those around the alcoholic. It's similar Burroughs's &quot;Junkie&quot; and DeQuincey's &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater,&quot; but lacks any of the glorification or knowing smirks of these two. It's not cheerful, and lacks much in the way of hopefulness -- except perhaps the care and understanding given the alcholic by those who love him.The basic plot: the alcoholic's family goes away, leaving him alone to drink his weekend away. He drinks and drinks, then drinks some more. Bad things happen.It is a well-written piece of literature, but I could not get away from seeing it as an addiction tale, something written by a social worker, or passed out at AA meetings. And I am not a social worker, nor even a drinker; I came to this book expecting a literary piece, but came away experiencing somehing of a didactic social commentary.Still, even if didactic, it is a highly enjoyable read. The main character manages to be sympathetic. The story is repetetive but still engaging: the reader simultaneously wishes and doesn't wish for Don to get that one last drink Don is always chasing after.Degradation and desparation abound in this novel. Don is witty, but this is not happy reading.Ultimately, this is sort of a cult piece. It may be something to give to your kids to teach them the evils of drinking. Although enjoyable and interesting, it's not one of the &quot;great&quot; pieces of literature. It IS, however, the best direct treatment I have read of alcoholism. Alcoholism is often a subtext in literature, but rarely is it addressed as directly as Jackson addresses it."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"Don Birnam is ecstatic when his brother Wick finally leaves their apartment for a long weekend in the country. Free of the constant watching, he is incredibly happy and feels even better after the second drink.Throughout the five days, Don drinks, makes and forgets promises, discovers numerous brilliant ideas for writing and dismisses them just as quickly, loses track of time. His mind takes him on a guilt-ridden trip through past experiences and hallucinations: in the backseat of a carriage with young Mel Ostler, his expulsion from a fraternity due to an \\"unhealthy\\" attachment to one of the brothers, his failed romances with Anna and Helen. And, during one of his blackouts, he awakens in a hospital with a black eye. The stocky male nurse comforts him and confides that \\"I know who you are.\\"This novel does a fine job of detailing what happens to someone in the grips of alcoholism: the desparate need, the hallucinations, the blackouts, etc. It is fast-paced and you get the feeling that you are living every moment with Don. Kind of a roller coaster ride and worth every minute."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"This book is definitely an instance of the book being better than the film, mainly because there is a wealth of inner dwelling in the book that cannot be captured on a screen. Jackson's prose starts out seeming a bit overblown, but quickly develops into a selfish, self-absorbed, and often offhandedly comical muse of the befuddled brain.Charming gallantry, lies and fictions, excursions seeking pawn money, reminiscing of days past, each one poetically narrated by Jackson. His protagonist, Don Birnam, never once denies who or what he is. He's an alcoholic, and he serves only himself.This book captures not just the degrading life of the alcoholic but the romanticism the addict infuses upon it. Even bungled up from a bad fall on the stairs, Don emphasizes his independence and self worth, at least internally, and leaves the hospital without treatment. He doesn't need anyone but himself, except when it comes to money to buy the booze.Don knows he is charming, and knows he can hurt people by charming them, but he does it anyway because of the need for his own personal release. His mental escapades are astounding, his tales larger than life, his delusions more than reality: his highs are extraordinarily high and his lows are extraordinarily low. What we know now that we didn't know back when this book was written is how many addicts are bi-polar, but Jackson managed to capture this aspect of addiction long before science did.'The Lost Weekend' isn't necessarily a fast-paced read, but rather something to nibble on when one is reflecting on what life has to dish out for us. For some, the monumental hurdles are mortgage and job promotions, for others, its finding those few bucks to get the next high.'The Lost Weekend' is a must-have for your addiction collection, exploring the inner-space of addiction rather than the outer-space, or consequences, of it. The complacency, the drama, the edginess, the fulfillment, the tides: it's all here in the quick, inside look at a singular weekend. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"In more than 60 years, I don't believe any book or film has so vividly captured the madness of alcoholism like \\"The Lost Weekend.\\" The movie with Ray Milland is a chilling adaptation of Jackson's masterful novel. One weekend in an alcoholic's life, as he begs, lies and steals in order to begin a bender that will end in a funhouse horror descent into insanity.Jackson's novel was brilliantly written, a voyeuristic look inside the mind and desperation of a drunk, who ping pongs between delusion and outright disgust about his habit. There are delirium tremens, falls down stairs, begging at the bars, the pawning of beloved items and absolute shame through it all. Jackson never tries to romanticize the disease or to add elements to it that are not already there. Alcoholism does not need a professional writer or movie maker to enhance its ugliness.Ray Milland takes on the movie role with animation, anger and pathos that is so genuine, you will think him authentically drunk throughout the film. The viewer is alternately sad and sympathetic, disgusted and frustrated as the drunk weaves, stumbles and staggers into his spree.Alcoholics cringe when they read this book or watch the movie. The circumstances are too recognizable, too real. The novel ends on a stark and gloomy note. The movie, which also drops the subtle homosexual undercurrent, chooses to end more optimistically.Either way, both are as clear and chaotic as any portrayal of a chronic alcoholic can be. For this reason, \\"The Lost Weekend\\" will always stand as powerful and unflinching, much like the disease it depicts."},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"Having seen the film I decided to read the book. The Hollywood ending of the film spured me on to find out how the book really ended. I found the book had much more depth than the film. Jackson's way of writing is so intimate that you can feel, hear and perhaps even smell Mr. Don Birman, who is the central character in the book. Jackon takes you inside his main character and slowly brings you down, down, down into the murcky depths of a troubled human being. It is obvious that the drinking is 'only' the manifestation of much deeper problems which Don Birman has. However the mental constructions which Don generates to explain, know (absolutely!), manipulate, justify, etc. his state of being, shows how an alcoholic survives as he swims in his sea of alcohol. It is a harrowing tale. This is a story about alcoholism written from the inside out. Read the book and learn how many alcoholism stories really end up.

I really liked it.Dr. Zorba's main point, just like the Greek's, is that there's more to life than simply good cholesterol and a low blood pressure. It's not that these strictly medical points are unimportant, it's just that the other areas in one's world can be just as significant, if not more so, in making life long.....and sweet. Dr. Zorba divides life into five interconnected spheres: physical, mental, kinship/social, spiritual and material (financial and job-related.) In each of these spheres readers are encouraged to find their own personal strengths and weaknesses. The book has a series of fill-in-the-blank charts and lists to help you personalize this information. There is a set of cards in the book's center with which can be used for &quot;Playing the hand you're dealt.&quot; The game is to arrange you longevity &quot;boosters&quot; and &quot;busters&quot; into some kind of order, discarding the ones that don't count for your specific genetics and lifestyle, and then to work on the ones that define your own unique longevity &quot;game.&quot; It may be a little hokey, but I got a lot of good ideas for myself out of it.What I really enjoyed about the book, though, were the stories. Just as things would start to get a little dull, the good doctor would tell a little tale about one of his own patients to make the point. I particularly liked the one about &quot;Ralph,&quot; whose two-month ride up to Alaska on a Harley did more good for his good health and longevity than all the standard medical advice he'd been given before it. This was true despite the fact that motorcycle riding is &quot;dangerous,&quot; if looked at out of context. Although riding a motorcycle may worsen your odds in the strictly physical sphere, it may actually boost your overall life expectancy when the mental, social and even spiritual spheres of the experience are included. In fact, motorcycling your way to a long life has a kind of Zen feeling about it, especially when you include the bike maintenance.This actually seems relevant, by the way, given the book's unexpected introduction by the Dalai Lama.Anyway, &quot;The Longevity Code&quot; seems like a well-balanced book, written by a natural storyteller whose advice is backed up by scientific evidence and clarified by examples from his life as an actual family doctor.

Martin and Andy Mangels have crafted a first-rate story that goes a long way toward reconciling how the two groups learned to work together and trust each other while at the same time fleshing out the characters and bridging some of the gap between Enterprise and the Original series. Then there is the little matter of a very shocking revelation within the framing story.The bulk of the action in Last Full Measure takes place right after the third season episode \\"The Xindi\\" so it's not surprising that the Military Assault Command Operations personnel have a fairly low opinion of Archer and his Starfleet crew. When Archer decides to lead a landing party to Kaletoo to follow another tenuous lead on the Xindi, Major Hayes has justifiable doubts about Archer's leadership skills but dutifully assembles a small squad to accompany the away team.Meanwhile T'Pol, who has been left in command on Enterprise, sends Mayweather and another squad of MACO's lead by Mayweather's nemesis Corporal Chang to investigate what appears to be the trail of a Xindi vessel. The trail leads the shuttlepod to a Xindi fuel facility and a showdown between Mayweather and Chang over the decision about what to do about their discovery.As the main narrative unfolds in Last Full Measure the tension between the MACO's and Archer's Starfleet crew is palpable. Mangels and Martin employ several tried and true storytelling techniques to simply and effectively take most of the Enterprise characters out of the equation early so that the reader's attention is focused on the small core group they tell their story through.This approach works wonderfully and although you barely know some of the major players as the story begins by the final chapter they feel like old friends. In addition to getting to know several of the MACO's a bit better we also get a chance to meet Lieutenant \\"D.O.\\" O'Neill, one of Enterprises watch commanders.Some people might be disturbed by the characterization of Archer in this story, primarily the methods he employs to ensure the \\"cooperation\\" of Trahve in tracking down the Xindi but given the weight of responsibility he carries you can understand those methods even if you can't agree with them.The surprise in the framing story raises lots of questions but once the initial shock passes you can sense that a door has just been opened that allows for some potentially exciting novels in the future."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"The third season of Star Trek: Enterprise was a season-long epic about the quest to destroy the superweapon aimed at Earth by the alien Xindi. Some liked it, some didn't, but there was no question that this was different for the television Treks, a story where each episode told a specific part of the story, rather than being self-contained. The latest Enterprise novel, Last Full Measure (by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels) takes place near the beginning of the season, and it's well-written (as is typical from these two). While I didn't enjoy it as much as I have some of their other work, it is definitely a novel worth reading.On their quest for the Xindi, the Enterprise has been assigned a platoon of MACOs (Military Assault Command Operations), soldiers that will be expected to be the ground troops for any planetary missions the expedition requires. Being spit-and-polish military, rather than rather laid back Starfleet types, tensions between the two crews begin to rise, especially amongst those Starfleet officers who have to make room for these MACOs. Especially affected is Ensign Mayweather, the helmsman of the Enterprise. His MACO roommate is really getting on his nerves, and it's made even worse when T'Pol assigns him to pilot a shuttle full of MACOs which includes his roommate. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed are having some growing pains of their own with the MACO commander, Major Hayes, on a clandestine mission that could turn out to be a Xindi trap. Both teams will have to use all of their ingenuity to get out of their predicaments, and they'll have to get past their prejudices as well.Mangels and Martin handle the Enterprise characters really well, even managing to make Mayweather interesting (not that they had much to build on from the television show). Some of the plot is a bit cliched, as we know how things will generally work out, not only because of where in the show this book takes place, but also because that's generally the way these types of stories work. On the other hand, the authors manage to demonstrate a successful sleight of hand technique in a couple of instances, including the resolution of one of the regular MACO soldier's storylines. I liked that, as I hated to think that the authors would give us something that ordinary.On the other hand, the torture aspect of the book seemed a little forced, mainly because I think it's dealt with a couple of episodes later in the series, and this doesn't seem to bring anything new. My memory of the episode is hazy, but I think Reed seemed surprised when Archer resorted to it, which he wouldn't have been if a similar thing happened as it does in this book. However, I do trust the authors to have done their research on that, so I'm just commenting on how it made me feel at the time. In the book itself, I thought the debate was well-handled, with Reed being the dissenting figure in the use of it, and then Mangels and Martin showing us why he's so against it. I did think Archer swung a little bit too quickly from one side to the other, however.The plot piles on the tension as it quickly shifts from one setting to another, with only the scenes going back to the Enterprise and Trip's dream sequences seeming to bring the book to a halt. After reading the whole book, I understand why these sequences are there, but for me they destroyed the pacing of the rest of the story. Just as I was getting interested in one mission or the other, we'd flash back to Trip and all of the tension would drain from the book, only to start filling up again when we went back to the action. I especially didn't care for the scenes because they dealt with Trip's guilt and remorse over his sister's death in the Xindi attack, which seemed like territory that's been heavily plowed over before.Even with that fault, though, Last Full Measure is hard to put down. Those scenes don't go on that long, and then we're back to seeing what wrenches can be thrown in the works for our two squads in jeopardy. Mayweather gets more characterization in this book then he did in the entire series, and everybody else is done well too. I found the MACOs interesting, fleshing out these characters that we only saw briefly on the show (other than Hayes). It was nice to see the grudging respect begin to take form as both sides realize that they need the other in order to complete their mission. That Starfleet people are soft, and that there is a reason for the military discipline of the MACOs. Oh, and there is one final thing that makes the book extra good. The framing story contains something that will make those fans who hated the series finale whoop with joy.Last Full Measure is the first Enterprise book I've read, as I wasn't too interested in the books that were written as the series was still ongoing. The quality of this book definitely ensures that I will be back for the post-series novels that will be coming in the next couple of years. And Mangels & Martin also demonstrate that there is some gold to be mined from the series itself. You just have to dig for it a bit.David Roy"},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"In the wake of the Xindi attack on the planet earth, Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the Enterprise have been assigned the challenging task of neutralizing a Xindi super weapon that is being prepared for the annihilation of the human race. Along for the ride is a troop of space-marines, the MACO's. The MACOs view the crew of the Enterprise as soft and undisciplined, while the crew looks upon the MACOs with discomfort and concern. The cauldron is set boiling as separate missions expose Captain Archer, Major Hayes, Lieutenant Reed, Corporal Chang, and Ensign Mayweather to the best and worst of one another, and themselves.In a quest to discover the location of hidden Xindi weapon construction bases, Captain Archer, Major Hayes, and Lieutenant Reed embark on a shuttlepod journey to the planet Kaletoo to track down a Xindi supplier.Later, Ensign Mayweather is assigned to track down an odd emission reading at the edge of the Kaletoo system - and to take a squad of MACOs with him.In the interweaving tales both sides of the 'sharks and squids' competition (mirroring the inter-service rivalry of modern day naval/marine contingents) learn valuable lessons about one another and grow in their (grudging) appreciation of the gifts and talents that both bring to the table in the fight to save the human race.Last Full Measure is a very, very satisfying read. The writing duo of Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels manage to do an outstanding job of laying out several supporting crewmembers who one grows to care for by the end of the story, interweaves the work with a large amount of Star Trek backstory (particularly in the Prologue and Epilogue), and offers up a satisfying moral and interpersonal relations tale.Sadly, however, while the novel is excellent, it goes to confirm in my mind a wide gap between Star Trek and the Enterprise series.Star Trek, at it's purest form, is both a social commentary and a space adventure. This book manages to capture both elements well, and yet still manages to fall outside the pale of what, in my mind, constitutes a Star Trek story.Conflict and the occasional poor decision needs to be a staple of good storytelling, particularly when one is attempting to create a sympathetic hero-figure. Sadly, in the tradition established in the televised episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise, Captain Archer continues to be depicted as an (at best) inept spacecraft commander, ill suited to the demands of tracking down the greatest threat to Earth that the human race has faced in a century. For most of the story, I had a very difficult time accepting Archer as a Starfleet captain, a position I grew to feel more and more during the third season of the television series. While Archer is well written given his previously established mindset, I have to admit that he is a commander I would never have followed into battle.Ensign Mayweather gets a good portion of development in this particular story, and the insights gel well with what we observed of him on-screen.The shining element of the story, however, is Lieutenant Malcom Reed. His reflections, his personal deliberations on right and wrong - particularly given his assignment as the Enterprise's tactical officer - are most satisfying, even if the internal dialogue that he has is criticized by some reviewers as being nothing more than ham-handed political commentary on the Iraq war. Reed's was the single-most compelling element of a very good story, and given my own personal views on matters of justice, integrity, and militarism, I found myself utterly sympathetic towards him from the outset.Martin and Mangels also use the novel to set forth the beginning elements of an Enterprise relaunch (using the framing material to do this quite well), and to place the events of Enterprise squarely into the Star Trek universe... while the actual tome convinced me more than ever that Enterprise is not truly Star Trek.Last Full Measure is good military sci-fi, and a compelling moral and personal tale, one that I would commend to all those looking for a morality tale and an action-adventure rolled into one; but it is barely Star Trek. This is not the fault of the authors, however, who have provided an excellent story to those interested in the investment."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"Seven million dead. That was the death toll when the Xindi attacked earth with their first attack. Now, they are constructing a weapon that would destroy the entire planet. Captain Jonathan Archer and his crew must work with MACOs, with whom they often have an adverserial relationship, to save the planet earth.Through the story, they are seeking clues in a part of space humanity knows little about populated by species they know even less of. However, failure is not an option as failure means the end of Earth.Through the story, Starfleet and MACO learn to work together. They learn, grudgingly at times, to have respect for one another. They realize that they are truly on the same side.The authors keep the story moving with vivid detail. You can picture the main players and events as they unfold in four different places, including the Xindi Homeworld, which Arthur and his crew is trying to find.Unfortunately, this book does not have the complete story of the quest as the ultimate fate is included in the TV series. If you have access to it, you need it to see what happens in the end. Other than that minor point, I think this would be an enjoyable book for Trekkers everywhere."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"Don't confuse this with a really great book by the same name by Jeff Shaara.

(JJ Abrams made this decision - it is still contrary to the thoughts of Gene Roddenberry, but I've never understood why Roddenberry wouldn't accept some of the better written books as Canon.)This is one of the books that is used as Canon for the new movie. It tells a story that takes place after the episode \\"The Xindi\\". It explores the relationship between the Starfleet Crew and the MACOs, and there is a framing story which contains some very interesting revelations. With a cast of characters you'd be familiar with having seen the show \\"Enterprise\\", there is information about one of the main characters of that show, as well as one of the main characters of TOS that serves to remind us that good fiction should be Canon.You'll want to follow this book with \\"The Good That Men Do (Star Trek: Enterprise)\\" as it is also considered as Canon and makes an excellent companion story to this - revealing more and concluding some \\"Enterprise\\" plot lines nicely."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"This is not a bad story, but it isn't all that great, either. For one thing, it shares a major problem with the series, one that is a major potential problem with any prequel: if you don't have any major events occur, it's boring, but if you DO insert major events to spice things up, the question arises of why these major events were never alluded to in the previously written, later-set stories. In the case of Enterprise, this trap is sprung when the series has the Xindi kill seven million people in a major attack, and the entire third and fourth season are spent trying to prevent them from finishing the job of wiping out humanity. Is it REALLY likely that in 78 original series episodes, (plus 6 movies) over 150 Next Generation episodes (plus 4 movies) over 150 Deep Space 9 Episodes, and over 150 Voyager episodes, numerous of which deal with events in the history (Genetics Wars, General Green & the third world war, the Bell Riots, First Contact, the Romulan War, etc) there is NEVER even a MENTION of a little thing like an alien attack that killed 7 million people, and ALMOST resulted in the destruction of all life on earth? I just don't see it. Yet this book, being set as it is during the period in the series that this takes place, suffers from this major flaw of the series.Further, the majority of the plot merely rehashes much of what was dealt with during this period in the series: the conflicts between the Starfleet personnel and the MACOs, and the gradual acceptance of those two groups for each other.If you are completely unfamiliar with Star Trek, and thus could not possibly care less about the lack of continuity between Enterprise and the previously established canon, you may enjoy this as simply a fairly decent action-adventure space opera with some character interaction. But if you are a fan, even if you don't care as much as I do about interseries continuity, if you've watched episodes of Enterprise during the third and fourth seasons of the show, there's nothing much new here."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"I'm not finished with it, but I have been reading \\"Last Full Measure\\". It's basically another story set during season three when the ENT crew were trying to find leads so they could find the Xindi weapon and home planet. It's a flashback story, the novel starts off 80 years after the Xindi fight is over, and this is someone from the ENT crew (not telling you who but you'll know) remembering this event. It really feels like another episode from season three when you read it. That can be a good or bad thing. It's nothing original, that's the downside. The good side is that it does have good interaction between characters, it tells what people think of other people on the Enterprise, mainly what the ENT crew thinks of the MACOs. While showing each character's point of view on the Xindi and their personal thoughts about them.It does have a few points about it that make it interesting, some of the crew are unconscious because of what they think is another \\"space anomaly\\", Trip and Hoshi being part of those who are unconscious. Being in a coma like state, Trip begins to dream about Elizabeth again. The tall, pyramid object on the cover of the novel is a tall memorial in San Francisco to those lost in the Xindi war and it is talked about in this novel.Overall, the novel is good for what it is, a story set in the Xindi search of Enterprise season three. It really does feel like an episode from that season, kind of makes you wonder if this is the episode the authors would have like to have done in season three. Instead of going back to season three, I would have liked to have seen an entire novel telling us what happened after season four."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"Martin and Mangels have followed their hearts, producing a ham-handed allegory, in the tradition of some of the worst Trek episodes.

Involving Captian Jonathan Archer and the Enterprise crew along with a contingent of MACO's (Military Assult Command Operations) personnel. A battle harden group of soldiers ready for planetside combat to complement the Starfleet personnel aboard the Enterprise, in search for the Xindi homeworld.The main events in the novel take place during the summer of 2153, between the Enterprise's discovery of a Xindi who was working in a mining complex(\\"The Xindi\\") and before the ship is stopped cold by a spatial anomaly and is boarded by pirates (\\"Anomaly\\").This novel has two main stories which complement each other. One is an away mission by Captain Jonathan Archer with a contingent of MACO's and they are on a learning curve of mutial respect. The other is an away mission headed by Mayweather with a MACO contingent,learning as they go along.Archer is looking for clues as to where the Xindi homeworld is and Mayweather is on a mission to blow-up a fuel depot in the middle of a nebula, where the Xindi refuel their ships. There is plenty of action in both away missions with surprises along the way to make the reader rivited to the action in both stories. There are twists and turns and when you think that the missions a in jeopardy, Martin and Mangels work their magic, as good authors do, and you are surprised by the outcome.I truely enjoyed this installment into the Star Trek: Enterprise universe where action-adventure, intrigue, and mystery were well salted in this novel. Making the reader stay with this book until the end was easy. Martin and Mangels are a writing duo that captivates the reader with a well-told story with details and very good character development.

Martin and Andy Mangelis have crafted a very good action-adventure tale in their novel \\"Last Full Measure (Star Trek: Enterprise)\\". It is commendable primarily for demonstrating how the MACO team of soldiers finally began bonding with Captain Jonathan Archer and his Starfleet crew aboard the USS Enterprise (NX-1) during their pursuit of the Xindi and their planet-destroying beam weapon in the Delphic Expanse. As such it is a fine bit of \\"Star Trek\\" fiction that will entertain anyone interested in \\"Star Trek\\" or is interested in a quick, enjoyable bit of literary entertainment. On the other hand, I would agree with one other Amazon.com reviewer who noted that the sociological aspects of the two military groups as depicted in the novel did not correspond with real-life militaries or, for example, such elaborately detailed space operas like David Webber's popular \\"Honor Harrington\\" series."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"This book shares its title with Jeff Shaara's concluding book in his trilogy.

I should have taken it as a harbinger of things to come.This book has no soul, it is not engaging, and it has a ridiculously idiotic notion of how real militaries act and work together. I'll make just two points about the latter and then summarize. 1.) Enlisteds do not berth with officers. Officers will double (or even triple) up with officers to clear bunk space for enlisteds, but otherwise they do not share the same social space. Thus Ensign Mayweather sharing a bunk with Corporal Chang just doesn't cut it. 2.) No enlisted personnel ever calls officers \\"scared rabbits\\" in an \\"attempt to shut them up\\" and corporals especially do not call ensigns that. I was a squid for a while, and whenever I encountered a marine corporal, he was obsequiously polite to me, the ensign.There was a lot more of the same in this novel.

I'm not interested in hearing what they have to say."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Enterprise: Last Full Measure","review":"...of how next-to-impossible it is for an ideologue to author a novel that isn't in some way a polemic for his worldview. Co-author Michael Martin's dedication gives you a warning right off--as well as to the late James \\"Scotty\\" Doohan, it's dedicated to Cindy Sheehan, who just doesn't get it when it comes to just what her son gave his life for in service to his Country. But it doesn't stop there. The Enterprise's mission this time includes several guests on board--a Marine commando team who Martin and co-author Andy Mangels present as direct descendants of Ollie North and the Great Santini. The idea is a surgical strike at the Xindi, who had just gotten done frying Florida and a chunk of South America, so it's better to find the source if the weapon that did it and destroy that source than to find the Xindi homeworld and return the favor on their civilian population. In their travels, a team headed by Archer himself finds one of those sleazy arms-dealer types who was responsible for supplying the materials for the weapon. When Archer decides that this character can't be reasoned with, could give a rat's you-know-what about what his customers did on Earth, he decides to get rough in interrogating him. This gives Reed a guilt complex based on an experience with bullies in his youth when he tried to stop a gang from brutalizing a smaller boy and was almost killed himself. Never mind that Archer's \\"victim\\" in this case is the type who would sell out his mother if enough gold-pressed latinum was in it for him. Of course, Reed has forgotten that there's a difference between bullying and \\"taking the gloves off\\" in response to an attack--that difference being motive. A bully brutalizes other people for purposes of enjoyment. He gets his jollies from it. A bully is just another type of sadist. A soldier is in the business of halting a bully society's attacks on his or her country. I can recall Gene Roddenberry's comments in the Original Series days, how his creation of the Star Trek concept included how that series symbolized America. Unfortunately, some of his descendant authors use that same concept to run down America. The Xindi attack on Florida is a fictional what-if--what if the 911 attack had been a lot bigger, commited by a much more powerful enemy? What if we'd lost a whole state and millions of people rather than the country's largest office complex and two or three thousand occupants?

His line drawings for the most part are undecorated even with cross-hatching: the single continuous line defines the faces, the bodies, the genitalia, the feet, the lips of his models. These are finely reproduced on several different tones of paper, each a full-page bleed. Then along with little quips from his feisty, shy, and sage mouth are his photographs of men including some self-portraits, some of transsexual friends, some of just beautiful male bodies, some of famous men from history. These photographs are at times followed or paired with the subsequent now famous silkscreen interpretations. Some collages and other experiments with imagery complete the set.By this time most people including the harshest critics have the consensual opinion that Andy Warhol was a significant figure in American art history. This fine book, very beautifully designed by Azi Rad, is a substantial volume of tribute to the simplicity of Warhol's genius. It belongs in the library of every art collector and everyone who appreciates the male form - especially as much as Warhol obviously did! Highly Recommended.Grady Harp, January 06"},{"Title":"Andy Warhol Men Address Book (Andy Warhol)","review":"What a great little book of delights! Here is a really beautiful collection of art by Andy Warhol, many of the works apparently published for the first time. There are color photographs here of men's body parts-- chests, feet, butts, etc.-- a series of color portraits of drag queens labelled \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\", photographs of a few celebrities including Mick Jagger and the artist himself eating a banana. But most of the book is taken up by beautiful line drawings of men-- figures, faces, body parts, even the feet of Christopher Isherwood. Alan Cumming in right on the money in his foreward: \\"just a simple collection of lines on paper that magically produce a sense memory of something so visceral it can actually arouse.\\" And Mr. Warhol had this thing about body hair! This is a very erotic collection beautifully produced that you will go back to again and again."},{"Title":"Fearless: Double Edition #6: Payback (#6) & Freak (#30)","review":"Freak reminded me so much of the earlier books. Gaia's relationship with Jake finally begins to take some actual hold, and i can honestly say i had butterflies in my stomach in some of the situations Gaia was put in (Sam + Ed + Jake + Gaia in the same room can only = awkwardness.)This book truly goes to show that no one is who they seem as new characters are revealed and old characters make a return appearance. I'm so glad to finally see Pascal focusing on the relationships in the series... It had me on the edge of my seat (and by seat, i mean bed,) and i'm counting down the seconds until the next one."},{"Title":"Fearless: Double Edition #6: Payback (#6) & Freak (#30)","review":"This was a truly great book. A way to put it is that all these books are pieces of one big puzzle, and several pieces of that puzzle were put together in this book. There are turning points in some books that completely switch the series around.....like Killer, where Ella dies, and Betrayed, when Loki goes comatose. This book is definitely a turning point. It's going to be interesting seeing where the series goes after this book, and that's one thing to anticipate. There are awkward situations in the book and situations that keep you turning the page, holding your breath wondering what will happen next. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Chimpanzee and Red Colobus: The Ecology of Predator and Prey","review":"I'm not a primatologist, thus this review is for people who may have a curiosity about chimp behavior as it may or may not relate to humans -- particularly the \\"warring behaviors\\" of chimps. The author packs a lot of research in this book -- statistical and anecdotal. Well written, highly readable. For those who like to see graphs and charts, there are also plenty of those. I bought this book as part of my research for teaching a war short stories college course. I was interested in learning about \\"violence\\" in animals and insects and comparing that violence with the human tendency to war. Well, I found plenty of relationships, and after a while, it became difficult to not see human behavior reflected in the fairly objective reports from the author/researcher. The information carnivorous habits (chimps hunt and eat colobus monkeys) is fascinating. As with Jane Goodall's research, the reader learns the individual characteristics and personalities of chimps in their peculiar society -- important, I think, as a way of viewing each animal as a societal force and to understanding the complex interrelationships, and their ties to power struggles. Most importantly, the book provides an insight into human behavior and how we negotiate and manipulate to achieve higher levels of power."},{"Title":"Double, Double, Oil and Trouble (A John Putnam Thatcher Mystery)","review":"John Putnam Thatcher gets involved in a kidnapping. Not as a victim, and certainly not as the bad guy, but as the one delivering the million and a half dollars in ransom to the Swiss bank where the terrorist group known as Black Tuesday will pick it up.Poor Thatcher. He likes a quiet life. But nothing goes his way. The ransom is picked up by a blond packbacker who immediately disappears. The terrorists remain quiet, but it takes weeks before the victim reappears. And when he does, the questions just become louder. Because the victim was the major figure in an important oil drilling contract for the North Sea in Scotland. His company wins the bid and are just beginning to get things ironed out when someone plants a bomb in his car. Then it turns out that he had never been kidnapped in the first place. So what happened to all that ransom money?I always like Emma Lathen's books, but since they are out of print, they are hard to find. I just got a copy of this one yesterday at a thrift store and I couldn't wait to read it. I hadn't ever read this one before and it was a real treat. I love her stuff. If you're a fan, I really recommend this one."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This novel is set in the Iceland of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The main character, Bjartur of Summerhouses, is a small independent crofter who takes his name from the holding he has purchased. In keeping with the book's title, Bjartur's independence is, in his own eyes, the most important thing about him. He is defiantly self-sufficient, proud of the fact that he calls no man his master and that he owes no man money, despite the fact that his life seems to be a succession of disasters. His first wife dies giving birth to a daughter, Asta Sollilja, who is not his. His second dies after a long illness. Several of his children are stillborn, one of his surviving sons disappears and another leaves him to emigrate to America. Bjartur expels the unmarried Asta Sollilja from his home after learning that she is pregnant with an illegitimate child. His sheep are hit by disease and he fails to rise out of poverty. He prospers for a time during the First World War, when there is an increased demand for Iceland's agricultural produce, but this is only temporary, and after the war ends he sinks back into financial difficulties and gets into debt. In the end he is forced to abandon his hard-won and much-prized independence, and in order to pay off his debts sells his croft to his enemy, the aristocratic Bailiff of Myri.Besides the story of Bjartur, the novel also touches on the social and political development of Iceland during these years. The Bailiff's son, Ingolfur Arnarson, has assiduously promoted a farmers' cooperative movement, ostensibly with the aim of freeing them from dependence upon a handful of wealthy merchants, but really in order to further his own interests. The book ends with Arnarson Prime Minister of Iceland and most of the members of his cooperative scheme, including Bjartur, impoverished or ruined.Bjartur, who is very much at the centre of the novel, is an ambiguous character. On the one hand, his determination to succeed and stoicism in the face of misfortune can be seen as admirable characteristics. On the other hand, there is also criticism of him, and of those like him, on account of his stubbornness and excessive pride in his self-reliance. His independence is not only economic but also emotional; he seems emotionally detached from all around him, including his family. The book can be seen as a critique of Bjartur's \\"independence\\" from two viewpoints, one political and the other psychological. Laxness seems to have been politically on the left, and Socialist ideas are introduced into the book near the end, when a strike takes place among Arnarson's workmen against their low wages. It is significant that the title of the work is plural- \\"Independent People\\"- rather than singular- \\"An Independent Man\\". Laxness's criticism of Bjartur's stubborn self-sufficiency may have been directed not simply at one fictitious individual but rather intended to have a relevance to Icelandic society as a whole. The political message is that Icelanders- particularly the Icelandic working class from which Bjartur stems- need to maintain solidarity and social cohesiveness which are being put at risk by the excessive pursuit of self-interest. Psychologically, the theme of the work is that \\"No man is an island\\". Those, like Bjartur, who attempt to live as one, will end up becoming isolated from their fellow-men.Laxness has been compared to Hardy, and there are certainly some similarities to the great English novelist's work in that \\"Independent People\\" makes use of the lives of the rural working class. A closer comparison, however, might be with the younger generation of British rural writers, such as Mary Webb and Sheila Kaye-Smith, who came after Hardy. There are close thematic links between \\"Independent People\\" and Kaye-Smith's \\"Sussex Gorse\\", another novel about a proud and independent-minded small farmer whose obsessive pursuit of wealth drives his wife into an early grave and alienates his family and children. The difference between the two works is that Kaye-Smith's protagonist, Reuben Backfield, is successful in material terms, although a failure in spiritual ones; the novel ends with him in a wealthy and complacent old age, having become the greatest landowner in the district. Whereas Laxness takes as his theme \\"No man is an island\\", the devoutly Christian Kaye-Smith takes as hers \\"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul\\"? Backfield's tragedy is that he does not even realise that he has a soul to lose.Bjartur, however, seems too cold and detached to be the hero of a Hardy novel. Michael Henchard in \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", for example, might be as stubborn and headstrong as Bjartur, but he is also an emotional man of strong passions; as a result it is easier for the reader to empathise with him. Henchard, like Tess, Jude and other Hardy heroes and heroines, can be seen as a tragic victim of fate, whereas Bjartur seems more like the victim of his own stupidity. \\"Independent People\\" also lacks the strong narrative drive of Hardy and his sense of the tragic. It is in many places ponderous and heavy-going. (I do not know Icelandic, so am unsure if that was the fault of Laxness or his translator). Although it is in many ways an interesting work, bringing to life a society in a remote part of Europe which is little-known in Britain, I did not really find it a very readable one."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"The fact that this book remained out of print in English for many years is astonishing. Also amazing is its absence from the many (albeit silly) lists enumerating the best novels of the 20th century. I certainly consider it the best novel I have ever read. Much of the book's appeal comes from its deeply rooted human themes. Laxness is largely credited with bringing the Icelandic myths to the Western literary conciousness. These myths (READ JUNG or J. CAMPBELL) are a founding force behind many of the world's religious texts. Independent People reaches into these myths and draws out a simple story which speaks to the deepest part of human nature. It is this contrast that makes the book so effective. The simplicity of the theme and the lightness of the plot underscore the weight of the human condition and the complexity of the human psyche. This makes Laxness' novel truly epic by definition: it can be read in two ways. On the one hand it is an adventure tale of a hero struggling to overcome the cruel and treeless landscape of Iceland. It is also a journey into our universal mythology, which is the metaphysical genetic code of the human soul."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"First things first: this novel gets five stars. It is my favorite of all novels and I have read it four times in print. This is one of those very special books that becomes greater every time you read it. There are not too many books you can say that about.But the Kindle edition is torturous to read because of the many OCR errors. I started adding notes to each error I found and by the time I had finished, I had 133 total! And I was not proofreading, I was just reading. If my proofing notes could somehow be sent to the publisher so that this book could be fixed, I would gladly do so for the benefit of future readers of this otherwise fabulous book. For an expensive Kindle book, this level of quality is simply unacceptable. I might view things differently if this was a free book, but it's not.I can understand an error here or there, but when you are reading a truly great book, the many typos become extremely annoying because they break the flow. It's like taking a peaceful walk in the woods on a nice summer afternoon, but you keep stubbing your toe on rocks in the path. Even when you are not actually feeling pain, you are tense and distracted because you know an unexpected \\"thunk!\\" will happen at any time. This ruins the enjoyment of the book.My recommendation is that you definitely read this book, but do yourself a big favor by purchasing a printed version that was made back when publishers cared enough about literature to employ proofreaders. You can buy one on Amazon :-)"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"What an amazing, overlooked, unexpected treat this book turned out to be. Halldor Laxness (who won the Nobel Prize in 1955) has performed the impossible: he's written a multi-generational saga centered about Bjartur of Summerhouses, a stubborn, foolish, often detestable curmudgeon, and he has somehow transformed this unlikely hero into a thoroughly likeable oaf. The result is nothing short of a miracle, both comic and tragic--and never predictable.In his introduction to this edition, Brad Leithauser reports on his meeting with the author in Iceland in 1986, when he tells Laxness, then an octogenarian, how much he admired Bjartur. Laxness responded, \\"Oh, but he's so stupid!\\" Leithauser's reply: \\"Oh, but he's so wonderfully stupid!\\" Exactly. Bjartur is an uneducated sheep rancher who has spent 18 years in servitude with one simple goal: to own his own land and live as an \\"independent man.\\" His philosophy is derived entirely from Icelandic sagas he memorized as a child; his politics are based wholly on the principle of sovereignty; his social skills are those of a loner.The resulting adventures are both hilariously mortifying and tragically doltish: within his first year, he is lost in a blizzard searching for a sheep that he believes has gone missing but that his malnourished wife has surreptitiously slaughtered and eaten. He returns to find his wife dead after giving birth to a daughter who is still barely alive. All that and more occurs in the first 100 pages, and to tell you much more is too give too much away. (Indeed, Leithauser's excellent introduction divulges too much of the plot and should be saved for the end.)Although Bjartur eventually remarries and raises sons, the story henceforth centers around the unlikely and uneasy bonding between father and daughter. In addition, Laxness weaves in the social and political changes transforming the country and victimizing any rancher who is caught up on the wrong side of the divide, which swings between capitalist financiers and cooperative societies. World War I brings untold wealth to the inhabitants of neutral Iceland, so \\"that the passion for building was exceeding the bounds of good sense, and that many children were returning home from school both hurriedly educated and over-educated.\\" Mutton and wool were suddenly all the rage and \\"peasant culture had suddenly become the great gospel\\" of the national authorities. All this is too much for the simple-headed Bjartur, whose blind devotion to pastoral traditions and to hermitic self-sufficiency works against him as often as it works in his favor.The translation by J. A. Thompson is startlingly fluent; it's often hard to believe that Laxness didn't write this book in English. Considering how funny, sad, heartwarming, trenchant, and topical this satirical epic is, even in translation, it's inexplicable that Laxness isn't better known--and it's incontrovertible that \\"Independent People\\" is a masterpiece of twentieth-century fiction."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I read this book the way I love to see films - grabbed by a friend, without knowing anything about it. A friend sent it, I tossed it in the suitcase; I was off for a research trip to the Arab world in the summer (110 degrees F.). I could feel the ice and the hunger of the book even while living in crowded, steaming surroundings. I know nothing of Iceland, &quot;but I know good art when I see it&quot; and this is the best book of the century. I sent it to a relative who lives in Alaska, and who normally reads only trade journals, and he loved it too."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Halldor Laxness won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955 mainly for this incredibly odd book about a sheepfarmer living in contempt of the world around him on a lonely croft. Bjarter of Summerhouses is very much an anti-hero; he treats his dog better than his wife and is obtuse in his pigheadedness. The book is mainly about how misfortune continually punishes someone you don't really care about, so why it works so well as a complete masterpiece of poetry and emotion is a mystery to me. It is a little slow in getting into at first, but the strength of Laxness' prose and characterization quickly gets to you. Bjartur's life is surrounded with people who are filled with love, and the irony in contrast with him is fascinating to notice. Classic topics such as pride and strength are explored ad nauseum, but every now and then we meet the supernatural, the beauty of nature and free thought, poetry and art and grace and an other-level comprehension of ordinary life that Laxness writes with astonishing beauty (if you read it, you'll know what I'm talking about). Life is not a parade for Bjartur, but he always maintains his dignity, and eventually it shows him how to live a life of humility and love. The journey to get there is a wonder to experience."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I notice that many reviewers have labelled this a tough read, or depressing, or a great book about Iceland, for god's sake. If you love literature, by all means READ THIS BOOK. Yes, it has depressing moments, but it is also laugh-out-loud funny (I swear). Bjartur is a man for the ages, a noble and maddening blockhead. The prose is lovely--it's hard to believe it is a translation. And the themes of family, independence, wealth, class and power are timeless. Don't be intimidated. You're an independent person, right?"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I was skeptical when a friend urged this one on me--a novel about an Icelandic sheep herder? I'd never heard of Laxness--and the Nobel Prize has sometimes been more of a political gesture than a recognition of true merit. But it took me no more than one paragraph to be totally absorbed. This book is, by turns, powerful, frightening, funny, and lyrical. Part of the credit is due to a masterful translation (I think, having no Icelandic whatever), or, at least a translation that never reads like a translation, if you know what I mean. But mostly it is the genius of the author, his ability to convey a physical image, an emotional context, the nuances and quirks of a character. This is the first time I've taken the trouble to write a review in here--but if there's a chance that someone might be inspired to get this book, then it's worth the effort. I compare Laxness to Hardy because of this writer's ability to evoke the ambiance of a place and to show his characters as organically linked to their roots. I see there are a few more of Laxness's books available in English and I plan to read all I can find. Get this one, by all means."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"PART THREE-- \\"It's a useful habit never to believe more than half of what people tell you, and not to concern yourself with the rest.&quot;At one point Bjartur goes away and leaves his children at home, during which time a man comes to stay with them, claiming Bjartur asked him to stay with them as their teacher. He has a profound impact on the futures of Bjartur's entire family. The teacher asks what wishes the kids each want to come true. &Aacute;sta's constant need for love and approval from father figure lead her to wish for love, which she believes she receives when she and the teacher start an affair together, which makes her feel scared but loved. She feels she is sinning, but the teacher replies, \\"Sin-sin is God's most precious gift.\\" When the teacher leaves, and &Aacute;sta is left confused, there is a telling scene between &Aacute;sta and her brother, Nonni, when Nonni tries to understand &Aacute;sta's sadness. \\"This was the first time that he has ever looked into the labyrinth of the human soul. He was very far from understanding what he saw. But what was of more value, he felt and suffered with her. In years that were yet to come, he relived this memory in song, in the most beautiful song this world has known. For the understanding of the soul's defencelessness, of the conflict between the two poles, is not the source of the greatest song. The source of the greatest song is sympathy.\\"When &Aacute;sta is to be baptized, finally, in the church, it is discovered that she is pregnant, and Bjartur, at this point, is heartbroken. Being the strict man that he is, he cannot forgive her and shuns her for life. &Aacute;sta is also heartbroken. The one important person in her life has left her at a time when she needed him most. Bjartur denies that he is even &Aacute;sta's father, claiming that &Aacute;sta's mother had had affairs with other men, so &Aacute;sta should seek out her real family.No matter what biology might have to say, after &Aacute;sta leaves, she is still Bjartur's daughter through and through. Later in life, when Bjartur's son Gvendur is leaving for America, he tries to give his sheep to &Aacute;sta as a gift, and &Aacute;sta, now with her daughter Bj&ouml;rt (the feminine form of Bjartur) states, \\"My little girl and I are independent people also, you see; we also are a sovereign state. Bj&ouml;rt and I love freedom just as much as our namesake does. We would rather be free to die than have to accept anyone's gifts.\\" &Aacute;sta does not lead an easy life from this point on, but Bjartur does not care... at least not until the end.Bjartur lives by the notion that nothing is worse than eating other people's bread. Literally and figuratively speaking. \\"Other folk's bread is the most virulent form of poison that a free and independent man can take; other folk's bread is the only thing that can rob him of independence and the one true freedom.\\""},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"After learning by happenstance that Halldor Laxness was the first (and only) Icelander to win the Nobel Prize for literature, I impulsively purchased his magnum opus, Independent People. Delving into the harsh, unforgiving world of an isolated Icelandic shepherd, Bjartur of Summerhouses, I was overcome by the coldness of the nordic winters and the romance of those hardy flowers--the souls of people and sheep alike--that bloom in the omnipresent darkness. Not having much time to read, I was forced to put the book down temporarily until I actually went to Iceland on a family vacation, incidentally unrelated to my interest in Laxness. I read on as we drove through Iceland's countryside, a cold and treeless yet magnificent place where some people still believe trolls live in the uninhabited interior, glaciers creep towards the low fjords, and moss and lichen cling to the sharp lava flows--assertions of independence in themselves.Indeed, Independent People is the story of obstinacy at odds with obstinacy--Bjartur stands on the precarious ledge of self-sufficiency, supported only by his own obdurate nature. But his family and countrymen are no different--independent in their own way; a root of self-satisfaction to be sure, but more often a source of strife and divisiveness. But overlying this theme is the obstinacy of nature, the unyielding and unforgiving solvent that harbors snow, darkness, disease, and hunger with no care for Bjartur's philosophy or struggle. Bjartur's epic path through Independent People is tragic and beautiful, an immensely satisfying journey into a world where infinity independent souls are perched atop the same precipice and only the toughest will remain."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Independent People is one of the finest literary novels to be written.

Though Bjartur invests much more energy in his pigheadedness, the similarities between the two characters make me want to think more about what Mississippi and Iceland have in common."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is a very moving book. The story is about Bjartur of Summerhouses and his (miserable) life as an independent farmer. The interest of the book comes partly from the vividness of its characters, esp. Bjartur and his daughter Asta Sollilja (actually his wife's daughter with the bailiff); the excellence of its comic sketches of Bailiff Jon who says very little and spits, his poetically inclined wife, Pastor Gudmundur the sheep-farmer, Bjartur's fellow independent farmers, etc.; the beauty of its descriptions of everyday life; and so on. Those are the things that make the book bearable. It is, however, chiefly a tragedy, and Bjartur is a tragic hero: stubborn, old-fashioned, fiercely defensive of his independence, but tender in an unsentimental way towards his sheep and Asta Sollilja.Bjartur comes to a bad end because, in the &quot;hubris&quot; caused by the rise of wool prices during the First World War, he tries to build a regular house to replace his traditional (tiny) hut.Bjartur is an old-world pioneer, and the bleakness of the book comes from its portrayal of the old world as a place with no space for pioneers -- a place where there is no new land, only abandoned land, and possibilities are rigidly circumscribed."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"It is not easy to read at all - I began the book before a trip to Iceland and I only made it through the first, say, two hundred pages because the reviews SAID it was so good and I just felt I SHOULD like it. It was long, dense. I swear to god there is a section of about 50 pages about just sheep. But it is SO, SO, SO, SO very worth it. It is hard as anything to read, but I PROMISE, anybody who makes it through this book (and if I did, then anybody can), will love it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"\\"Again and again the girl waited for the next hilltop to refresh the eye with some variation, some new prospect, but always it was the same endless repetition except that the gleaming waters of the lake had long since been left in the rear. She had lost all anticipation and had long grown tired of expecting anything in particular when the road, turning suddenly, dipped downward along the side of a deep ravine with a river at the bottom.\\"\\"The most unpleasant feature of mid-winter is not its darkness... more unpleasant still, perhaps, is that it should never grow dark enough for one to forget the endlessness of which it is a symbol; the endlessness that in reality is akin to nothing but justice itself; which fills the world, like justice, and like justice is inexorable. Mid-winter and justice are two sisters; one realizes best of all in the spring, when the sun shines, that they were both evil. Today is the shortest day. Perhaps those who manage to survive this day will be safe, let us hope so.\\"How does one begin to describe or, worse yet, review a novel that is regarded as an epic... that is a part of the Icelandic national consciousness and is the most famous contemporary Icelandic piece of literature, not to add that it was a Nobel winner? I am certainly not in any position to offer any sort of critical analysis of something so well-respected (unless of course I thought that all the respect and praise of the novel for the last half century was undeserved. I might be entitled to that dissenting opinion, but I cannot say that I have such an opinion. My opinion of this novel is that it is a masterpiece). The harshness of life in Iceland throughout the ages is discussed in grueling detail in this novel, and at times the prose does go on at length about the perils of being a sheep farmer (\\"Sheep had been a greater curse to the Icelandic nation than foxes and tapeworms put together. \`Sheeps clothing disguises a ferocious wolf...; people run after sheep all their lives long and never find them. Such is the lesson we may learn from the parting that oppresses us today.'\\" and later in the novel, \\"it was growing daily more and more obvious that the country's worst enemy was no longer the fox, the country's worst enemy was the sheep.\\") The protagonist of Independent People, Bjartur of the Summerhouses, is a stubborn and crusty and, above all, independent man. He is resistant to change and never sees fit to keep abreast of the modern times or news of the day. You as a reader may not feel a great amount of sympathy for him and some of his hard-headed and even cruel ways. You will likely respect him for the strength of his convictions, and maybe even laugh sometimes. (I laughed at the following passage, for example: \\"And if Bjartur heard them complaining about the damp, he would reply that it was pretty miserable wretches that minded at all whether they were wet or dry. He could not understand why such people had been born. \`It's nothing but damned eccentricity to want to be dry,' he would say, \`I've been wet more than half my life and never been a whit worse for it.'\\")Bjartur (which is an Icelandic word meaning \\"bright\\" or \\"shining\\") buys a farm and calls it \\"Summerhouses\\". The farm he purchases is said to be cursed by the spirit of Gunnvor, a woman who apparently lived there centuries before and had killed and eaten people. Bjartur was not a superstitious man and disregarded the legends and began his life at the Summerhouses, married a woman named Rosa, and started farming. (The superstitions about Gunnvor and the curse on Summerhouses are a good contrast for the juxtaposition in Iceland between Christianity and more traditional nature religions/worship. The minister embodies many of the contradictions that are felt throughout the novel, \\"In his contradictions he was as much an enigma as the country itself: a religious devotee out of spite at the soullnessness of men who thought of nothing but dogs and sheep, a scientific breeder of sheep because of his contempt for sheep, the Icelandic pastor of a thousand years' folk stories...\\" This struggle between Christianity and the traditional forms of worship also comes into play in the following passage, with the Bailiff speaking, \\"I've always kept my Christianity before me, and I demand that others also should have the Christianity necessary to bring them within the rule of law. I've always had a picture of Christ hanging in my room, a picture that was left me by my mother.\\" (\\"Yes, and one of the Russian czar, too,\\" interposed Bjartur)-\\"yes, one of the Russian czar is a highly respected sovereign who has always ruled his subjects well, and that they at least aren't a gang of stubborn heathens who call ghosts and monsters down upon their heads the way you do.\\")"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Laxness has created a true hero in Bjartur Jonssen of the Summerhouses, a man determined to overcome the hardship of raising sheep in the Icelandic hills in order to maintain his independence. In the process he sacrifices his family in order to stay true to his quest. One by one family members succumb to his obsession and Bjartur himself pays a high price for his pride.

Unfortunately the introduction is written by a bore who gives away most of the best moments. If you want to truly enjoy this book as written by the author save the introduction for last (if at all)."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"In &lt;Independent People&gt;, Halldor Laxness demonstrates that he is a master in the use of an artistic device that has succeeded for centuries--the juxtaposition of a rugged, immutable landscape with the drama of human experience. An obdurate or bleak landscape, especially one with an inhospitable climate, can bring into high relief the fragility and transience of human existence. Laxness contrasts an unforgiving Icelandic glacial valley with characters whose existence is defined by their struggle to survive in it. One reflection of his genius in this novel, however, is that he is not simply content to use this artistic device in a straightforward way, for he also draws the &lt;similarities&gt; between the geological stage and the human drama.This is most evident in his portrayal of Bjartur, the principal character. This rugged sheep farmer often seems to us just as hard and cruel as the landscape in which he hacks out an existence. His obsession with independence leads him at times to value the lives of animals over those of his family. He actually seems to &lt;be&gt; part of the landscape against which his family perpetually struggles. His granite personality heightens our sense of the humanity of others in the book and leads us to empathize more with them, even if we do hope often for his success. He is a boulder, they are people.But the landscape is not always cold and dark. It teases us with a short, warm and green summer, and throughout the book we see fleeting signs of warmth in Bjartur as well. In the towering crags surrounding his farm a single flower can sometimes survive and grow, and we want the seed of empathy to find root in this hard man. Our tension steadily grows as we wonder whether he will be able to overcome his seemingly immutable nature and nourish such a little flower.Bjartur is large as a figure in an Icelandic saga, and this adds to the epic and heroic qualities of the book. The frustrating predictability of his character is a source of both tragic and comic elements. Numerous themes of opposition, contradiction and relativism reinforce the landscape/humanity contrast and add complexity to the novel--e.g., religion vs. superstition, religion/superstition vs. logic/science, the benefits that flow from the evils of war, capitalism vs. socialism, the insensitivity of civilization, etc. Other characters in the book are well developed, especially Bjartur's daughter, who plays a principal role in the theme of male-female contrast. Throughout, Laxness demonstrates keen psychological awareness, and he keeps us guessing and surprised.These and other qualities make this one of the best books I have ever read. When I reached the last page, I wanted to begin again. It is as timeless as its landscape."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is one of the best books I have read for a long time. It is the epic story of a poor sheep farmer in Iceland in the early part of the twentieth century. His tragic flaw is his belief that a person should be totally independent. He believes this so strongly that it ends up alienating him from his family and everyone else around him. He would rather starve than accept help from anyone. Since his independence comes from being able to raise his sheep, they mean more to him than any person. In one scene he is out chasing a lost sheep while his wife is at home dying in childbirth. When he goes to the Baliff's house for assistance he first wants to negotiate buying a new sheep to replace the one he lost before he can talk about the fact that his wife is dead and he now has a helpless infant he has no idea how to raise.Woven throughout the novel are themes coming from the thousand year history of Iceland and the difficulty of living in a harsh, beautiful landscape. He tries to come to terms with the evil spirits people say dwell on his land, tries to move from the traditional sod house where he lives with his animals and tries to adapt to the new cooperative social stucture replacing the medieval one he grew up in. By doing so he is more able to understand the people around him and can forgive the favorite daughter he rejected earlier.The novel is so well written and the characters so well developed it is easy to see why Laxness won the Nobel prize for literature."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Even though this book is about a sheep farmer in Iceland around the beginning of the century, I was hooked from the begining. What it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in characters, satire, and tragedy. If you like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, this Nobel Prize winner is for you"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"There are multitudes of underlying themes in INDEPENDENT PEOPLE that it almost demands a second reading to fully appreciate this novel. Halldor Laxness created an enriching tale of Bjartur, a hardheaded sheep farmer who is fiercely loyal to the concept of remaining self-sufficient. After spending 18 years as a laborer he finally saved an adequate amount of money to purchase his own plot of land. Unfortunately, Bjartur's new land happens to be haunted with evil spirits that he is determined to ignore and discredit. He cares more for his sheep than for his family and remains stubborn as Iceland embarks on a socialist platform. Will Bjartur be able to modify his allegiances before he is left behind in the new Icelandic markets? More importantly, will he learn to accept the choices and faults of his children?Laxness paints a picture of the bleakness of rural life in Iceland in the early 20th century. The reader receives a feeling of the climate and land as well as rural Icelandic society. Laxness' portrayal of the dales and moors very often results in a sad picture of humanity. On top of all that, the hard life of the sheep farmer makes for a very sad story. The absurdity of life really shines through. For these reasons many people will assess INDEPENDENT PEOPLE as being too grime and depressing as it is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" book, but at the same time there is a hidden quality that brings beauty to Bjartur's life on the dales. If you're able to uncover that beauty as I have then you many just enjoy INDEPENDENT PEOPLE as much as I have. And don't forget the subtle humor involved. I simply could not help laughing at Bjartur's stubbornness. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Haldor Laxness, the Nobel laurette and Icelandic genius, creates one of the most satisfying books with &quot;Independent People.&quot; It is of such epic proportions and yet so earthy that one is continually struck by the dichotomy. The hero is a simple, poor farmer; he is not great, he will never be great (unlike Achilles who was great all his life). The landscape is so expansive and beautiful that it is hard to imagine a more magnificent scene, and yet this is also a land of hardship and famine and cold death. The book operates on so many levels that all one can do is bathe in its beauty and try to absorb as much as possible; whether the names (Asta Sollilja is exquisite), the land shapes, the farmers life, the love, the hate, the passage of time, the pressure of living an independent, free life, all of this deeply impress you upon reading the work. It is something I enjoyed, enjoy, and hope to read every year hence, so that I may enjoy the epiphanic revelations it provides."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"It is unfortunate that we live in an era when coming across a book as well-written, wonderfully-plotted, and otherwise stunning as INDEPENDENT PEOPLE should be an accident. While schoolchildren and college kids everywhere are rotting their brains with the well-known lit of the centuries, INDEPENDENT PEOPLE is overlooked and largely ignored and that, too, is saddening.Laxness's best-known work is truly a masterpiece, a fusion of wit and tears, of happiness and slavery, and it isn't often that books that attempt to combine those things are, in the end, quite flagrant. Thankfully, this particular saga justified the author's reception of the Nobel Prize in Literature beyond reasonable doubt.This is a book I will most certainly promote, push, and peddle to everyone and anyone who has at least some taste in reading."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Books that take me to another culture, time and place are the top of my reading list. This one certainly does just that. Bjartur is one of the most unlikeable but yet interesting characters in literature. His quest for independence is admirable yet at times just stupid and cruel. The portrayal of the life of an Icelandic peasant is so well crafted one can almost hear the sheep bleating. This is definitely a well written, deeply thought provoking book.Yet, it is also hard to read especially at first. It took me quite a while to get used to the language and the use of personal and place names (I have absolutely no familiarity with Iceland or its culture). Several times I had to go back and reread.This is a great book; however, I must recommend one that I felt was even better in its portrayal of a peasant family in Norway: Knut Hamsun'sGrowth Of The Soilwhich won the Nobel Prize in 1920. If you liked INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, please take a look at Hamsun's book as well."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is perfection in every sentence. Nothing more to say. Except that if your edition contains a foreword by Brad Leithauser, don't read it until after you've finished! It will reveal too much of the story, and it will also influence your perception and your expectations. And while you may disagree with some views in the foreword, certainly you will agree with the claim that this is one of the best books ever. Unless you think that a good book should have hobbits in it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"It is not easy to read at all - I began the book before a trip to Iceland and I only made it through the first, say, two hundred pages because the reviews SAID it was so good and I just felt I SHOULD like it. It was long, dense. I swear to god there is a section of about 50 pages about just sheep. But it is SO, SO, SO, SO very worth it. It is hard as anything to read, but I PROMISE, anybody who makes it through this book (and if I did, then anybody can), will love it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"There are some novels that captivate you but there are others, far rarer, that both captivate you and leave you changed as a result. &quot;Independent People&quot; is of the latter. The reader emerges edified, emotionally challenged, and left with the experience of being immersed in a foreign world. Laxness is uncompromising, like Joyce. You accept him on his terms alone. His characters are common folk, difficult, itinerant, headstong, sometimes unlikeable, very often unappealing at the very least, yet at the same time they are archetypal and you grow to care about them almost in spite of yourself. If one has read the Icelandic sagas, Njal's Saga, for example, the tone will seem somewhat familiar. &quot;Independent People&quot; is, like Njal's Saga, peopled with plainspoken and thorny characters, abject in many ways, but who are capable of surprise and subtlety as well. Its main character, Bjartur, is in some ways like Njal of the sagas; he's a man who lives by his own code and who prides himself on avoiding the entanglements brought by others, but who is drawn in despite himself. One of the techniques Laxness uses which is curiously absent from much modern fiction is that his characters don't always know what their next moves will be, and just when you think you've anticipated them, Laxness throws you a curve. But he doesn't do so in an expository fashion; often, it is only in the action or thoughts of others in reaction to the principal characters that the reader realizes someone has changed their mind, or acted differently than we'd expected. Laxness prompts the reader to engage in the sometimes chaotic lives of his protagonists, and to pay attention. So, what is it about? Superficially, it's about rural homesteaders in turn-of-the century Iceland. That may sound unpromising, but if you take the chance, you'll find this highly rewarding."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Independent PeopleI gave this book 4 stars only because it's a fairly tough read. The author's prose and poetry is absolutely beautiful. Truly, his writing is magical. However, the story itself can be frustrating - the main character just doesn't move forward in life - he's doomed by his own independence. If you are a reader who loves really well written books, read on, but if you are someone who wants to \\"feel good\\" after reading, you might stay away from Independent People. One other note, in the new release, the introduction is basically a \\"Cliff Notes\\" of the book. I would not recommend reading this until AFTER reading the entire book."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I don't even want to call this a \\"book\\". It's something different. It doesn't only tell you something or show you something it GIVES you something; something that nothing else can give you and that no one can take away from you.Laxness does what every author wishes he or she could do. He does it more beautifully, with more gentleness and sternness and joy, fear and trembling. All the while he has evaporated into every rotted wooden picket and dark rock scattered in the fields of Iceland. Never have I read a book where the voice of the writer has become such a part of the landscape and characters. I feel strange even calling them \\"characters\\", because it hard to believe that they had never even really lived.So please, if you pick up this book and wonder if you should read it, or follow through with it please do. It's worth bearing with the rainy days and sheep and the worms and the marsh; there is little more beautiful than the flower that raises its head amongst the stones around it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"One of my favorite books ever. I'm writing just to warn readers not to read the tremendously idiotic introduction. The guy gives away the plot to the book. The \\"smart\\" people at Vintage evidently don't know the difference between an introduction and an afterword. They should be shot (at the very least)."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"At the beginning of this edition of \\"Independent People\\" is a patch of thin ice onto which you must not--must not--venture. It is Brad Leithauser's forward, which should really be an afterward (and it would be a very good one, indeed). Unfortunately, Leithauser's essay gives away the plot in ways that no introduction ever should. Should you fall into this before reading such a wonderful novel, you will be very very sorry.Once past this danger, prepare to give this book your full attention and to lose yourself in another time and place. There are many summaries of this novel in other reviews, so rather than repeat them, I'll just mention two things, and I won't give away anything. First, enjoy Laxness's rendering of the farm talk among these Icelandic crofters when they come together at weddings and funerals. It's specific (sheep maladies, taxes, straying children, straying sheep), bleak, colloquial, and often comic. If you live in a rural area, you can hear a version of the same thing at the feed store or a church supper. Second, get ready to be astonished at the sheer complexity of all of the characters, even minor ones, not just the central characters, Bjartur the crofter and his daughter, Asta Sollilja. There is, for instance, Madam Myri, the local well-to-do poetess who makes pronouncements on the virtues of rural life. There is Hallbera, the muttering grandmother who lives longer than almost anyone else, like a candle (as the narrator says) that can't be snuffed. You will not be able to forget any of them.This is not an easy novel to recommend to others. A novel about an Icelandic sheepherder, you say? A novel about a man so conservative, so principled, so stubborn, and so independent that he expects nothing from anyone (including the government) and can scarcely accept a gift proffered freely? Is Bjartur a man for our times?Don't fail to get your hands on this great novel so that you can decide for yourself.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Even Iceland had its problems with ignorance and fear of progress. No knowledge of Iceland, except that it is an isolated northern island, is necessary to appreciate this marvelous story. It's a book about people more than place. Having read it, I do want to learn more about Iceland, though.The main character is very unlikable. His single-mindedness is what drives the entire book. His treatment of other people, including his family, compared with his treatment of his sheep is the critical focus of the book.I don't know if I would have preferred another ending, but will accept what Laxness gave us.

It's the story of Bjartur, an indentured servant who purchased his freedom with 18 years of hard work. Bjartur sets out to be truly independent by owning his own farm-- which happens to be cursed. This saga dissects the Icelandic social system, Bjartur's psyche (& those of all other characters), & illustrates the effects of war and greed on both. E. Annie Proulx, Jane Smiley & I agree: I think it's one of the best books ever written. Don't read the Introduction.

You'll be rewarded with immersion in a time and place completely different from ours. You'll feel the cold and smell the smells.

In Bjartur's time to fail and lose all was catastrophic -- no safety net in his bleak time and place.I agree with those below -- don't read the introduction.

The central character is a rough and self-proclaimed independent sheep farmer called Bjartur, who early on establishes his croft in which the isolated events of his family are played out. Bjartur is the central antagonist of the story, but the most striking character is his daughter Asta Sollilja. This lonely pubescent girl is the heart of the novel, embodying beauty, pity, tragedy; she is the face of Iceland. Her relationship with her father is awkward, heavy, yet extremely endearing."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"1st let me say that I truly enjoyed this book. I found myself having to put it down from time to time because 1. It was to overwhelming and 2. Sometimes it dragged on a bit. But, having lived in Iceland for 2 years while in the Navy and having travelled all over the country, I can say that this book hits the Icelandic independent character and nature right on the head. Quite disturbing in its harshness, this book wants to make you scream at Bjartur for his stubborness and hug the poor daughter for her confusion. Overall, a great book with just minor flaws."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I selected this novel for reading because of the superlative comments about it made by authors for whom I have great admiration and also because of the Nobel Prize in literature awarded to the author. I have now read about one third of the novel and am abandoning the remainder as the bleakness and tedium of the narrative is casting a dreary spell for me. The characters are drawn very well but over and over the same traits of character are reiterated. The mis-en-scene is wonderfully executed: bleak and unforgiving again and again, filled with unpleasant and stale odors, truly a place where life can be lived only on its barest edge. The point seems to be that the central character's wish to be free and independent of the need of other people is exactly what undermines his finding anything resembling contentment, the only morsel of contentment is in seeing himself as independent.I will not say that that the novel is not well-written and that there are not some passages which are so full of irony as to bring an occasional chuckle. But tedius and repetitive it is, just like the character's life. Overall there is too much drear here for me to spend any more time.

After 18 years as a hired hand, Bjartur has acquired his own lease, a small croft named Summerhouses, in a reputedly haunted valley. Here the indefatigable Bjartur experiences the deaths of two wives, attacks on his sheep, the vagaries of weather and international wool and mutton prices, and the loss of most of his children.Bjartur is inherently conservative and fiercely independent and accepts neither assistance nor charity. In Bjartur's mind, independence is a singular virtue, and independent people are apparently invincible. I loved this book but I did not find it easy to read: I found the unremitting struggle of Bjartur and his family depressing. But the words! The prose was beautiful and Laxness's description of Bjartur's world kept me engrossed even though I was not comfortable in it.\`And the wheel went on spinning through time's expanse.'This is a saga about fate, fortune, family and the politics of life.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"He who keeps his sheep alive through winter lives in a palace.A free man can live on fish.

After 18 years of \`slavery', he bought his freedom and started his own sheep business.His daughter makes it to freedom from her bossing father. Their relationship is one of the main themes of the novel.The only main character who has mostly other things in mind is Titla, the bitch, who loves nothing better than being a sheep dog. Her communication with her boss is one of the chief pleasures of this gorgeous, funny, dramatic, poetic tale.Bjartur is one of the great characters of 20th century literature. Congratulations if you don't know him yet! You are in for a treat! He is not just legally and physically independent from his evil old boss, but also mentally from the curses of Iceland's witches and their black magic. Not that they give up easily. And more, he is independent of other superstitions (which, on second thought, might more or less rule him out as a genuine American hero.)Surprisingly, Bjartur is also a poet and a connoisseur of poetry. (Is that a normal affliction of shepherds? Iceland may be special, after all.) Another poet is the wife of his boss, who is not held in much esteem though. She is fond of praising poverty (poor people have fewer worries, they just work a little longer), while the crofters prefer to discuss tape worms and lung worms.It is a book about sheep and about a lot else. It is not always politically correct by our standards of today. (Women are even more to be pitied than ordinary mortals.)It is a pity that the editors did not find it necessary or did not take the time or trouble or expense to provide a glossary. That would have made some parts of the tale easier on us sheepless creatures.P.S. I like the book so much that I could not wait until I finish it but needed to post the review halfways. While it is not likely that I change my mind, I may find additional things to add.Like this one: Bjartur is so proud of his independance that he even praises his sheep for theirs: they don't need man!By the way, if you don't know Laxness at all and are wondering what he could be compared to: I would say he is closest to Steinbeck and his Salinas stories, both in style and content and humor. Looking at other Scandinavians, you may be surprised at another comparison: some chapters, when he describes the world from Bjartur's kids' perspective, are from the H.C.Andersen school of marvels.

He had left his daughter to attend to the household and she was anxiously waiting for the day that he would return. It tells of him returning over the familiar hills and his thoughts. The next chapter he's been home for awhile and there is nothing about her reaction on his return. Also, the conflict between the father and daughter doesn't actual materialize significantly until your about three quarters of the way through.

Does their disgusting depravity known any bounds? Is there a depth so low that commies will not sink to it in their desire to steal the property of other men?

Blond-haired, eagle-eyed justice-seeking heroes that fight for independence. Proud and Fair, with a rich culture and a tradition of independence in the harshest environments. But as the book goes on the reader begins to see that he wants no part of these people and their hopes and dreams. In a mirror of Iceland's political history of his time (http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html) - He begins to denigrate the ideals of the great Icelandic people. By the end of the book, the independent man is show to be a helpless nobody, unable to adapt to the times. The problems of the protagonist - like being forced into communes and having his money stolen are all just explained away as fate. (...). Communists are portrayed as good guys on the verge of murdering Iceland civic leaders who somehow deserve to get it because other commies were a failure. That's right. The whole point of this book is not that icelanders are independent, but that commies should be allowed to take everyone's property and kill civic Icelandic leaders.In short, Halldor Laxness wouldn't know independence if it bit him on his fat ass. And it did. Repeatedly. And he still didn't know what it is. A communist like that needs a lesson. FROM MR KNIFE. AND THEN MR TORCH. That will teach him about human nature."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Independent People is not a book for everyone. It is a long, slow and sometimes punishing read. Laxness paints the sheep farmer's life in bleak tones. Think of Solzhenitsyn's Siberia or Rolvaag's Dakota prairie. So dismal is the mood at times that the reader feels the imminent onset of seasonal affective disorder. But Independent People also contains moments of pure, distilled beauty so arresting they seem to stand out from the cold landscape like stars in the ink of darkness. Bjartur of Summerhouses is a true epic hero. As Monte Christo is to vengeance, Bjartur is to self-determination. His emotional intransigence and the suffering he visits on all those close to him is balanced only by the enormity and brute force of his will. Asta Sollilja, his daughter, is the only possible counterweight to his obstinacy, in both emotional and literary terms. She is strong and sensitive, beautiful and grotesque, half Bjartur, half anti-Bjartur. Her duality provides the story's central drama and the book's over-arching metaphor. Masterfully constructed of vignettes woven into small books, Independent People is seamless. Laxness's voice is clear and lyric, never showy. The writing is fresh and modern, yet seems to be channeled from Iceland's mythic past. This is a land populated by many dark spirits and one never feels quite free of their presence here. Certain images from Independent People are indelibly etched on my consciousness. A man violently and accidentally riding a reindeer. A girl longing by a window for a stranger she's met just once. A young man seduced back to the home he has left by a siren on horseback. There is something more to why I love this book. I spent a week in Iceland in July 1998, and was transfixed by its rugged, austere beauty. The feeling I had while reading Independent People was the same feeling that possessed me the entire time I was in Iceland. It was the cold, astonishing sensation of stepping outside your self and gazing on the topography of your own heart."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I first read \\"Independent People\\" in 1996 after reading Brad Leithauser's essay in the \\"New York Review of Books.\\" Leithauser's praise of the book and the author were so intriguing that I went to the library that day and found an earlier edition. I recently had the opportunity to read the book again, with Leithauser's essay serving as an introduction. A single reading cannot exhaust this outsize, obscure novel by the 1955 Nobel-prize winner from Iceland.On a simple level, \\"Independent People\\" deals with the lives of the poor sheep grazers in Iceland early in the 20th Century. The hero is a farmer named Bajartur of Summerhouses who, after 18 years of working for another, the baliff, earns enough money to buy his own small farm. Bajartur's goal is to be independent and self-sufficient, to take what he earns and not take or give to others. In addition to this simple economic credo for independence. Bjartur is an \\"independent person\\" emotionally in his relationships with his wives -- he is twice married in the book -- his three sons and his daughter -- actually his first wife's daughter but not Bjartur's -- whom Bjartur names Asta Sollija the \\"beloved sun -lily\\" whom he refers to as his soul's \\"one flower.\\" Much of this long, multi-faceted book involves Bjartur's relationship with Asta Sollija -- their estrangement and ultimate reconciliation.Bjartur and Asta Sollija and their relationship frames but hardly exhausts this book. There is a picture of Iceland -- or of modernizing society in general with its conflict between farmer and town. There are long discussions of poetry and literature, of war, of politics, and particularly of philosophy and religion, see below. For all its length and seriousness, much of the book is funny, almost satirical in tone in the way it pokes fun at Bjartur and his intellectual and emotional limitations. The reader still comes to admire Bjartur for his fortitude and stubborness.The book is timeless in character and the chronology is blurred. World War I plays a pivotal role in the middle of the book but the times before and the times after seem to be endless and undefined. There is something that is prototypical and archetypical about this book -- it is hardly an exercise in the realistic novel.From a subsequent essay about Laxness by Brad Leithauser, I learned that Laxness was the kind of person generally called a seeker. This made me admire him and this book all the more and informed greatly my second reading. Growing up in a small, isolated nation, Laxness read exhaustively and put something of himself into his readings. He changed his mind many times during his life, being at various stages entirely secular, a socialist with perhaps communist leanings, and an adherent of various forms of Christianity. He took a rare delight in important ideas and showed an openness and fluidity to them that I find reflected in the themes of \\"Independent People.\\" Most obviously, their is Bjartur's character with its emphasis on economic self-sufficiency and laissez-faire. This attitude leads to Bjartur's heroism but also his poverty, and it is contrasted artfully with the cooperative movemement and, implicitly, with a socialist approach to society in the early 20th century.The book is pervaded by a strong spiritual tone. Bjartur for most of the book represents a position of independence and utter skepticism, but at key moments he does things not fully consistent with his stated beliefs. The book is framed by old Icelandic pagan legends and by spirits who are said to continue to haunt Bjartur's farm. We see various Christian ministers who in general are satirized in the course of the novel. But I was most impressed with the following erudite, and well-taken reference to Zoroastrianism, the religion of good and evil,which is alluded to many times during the course of the book and frames its story. In a moment of irony, Laxness puts the following speech early on, at Bjartur's first wedding, into the mouth of the bailiff's wife.\\"I don't know whether you are aquainted with the religious beliefs of the Persians. This race believed that the god of light and the god of darkness waged eternal warfare, and that man's part was to assist the god of light in his struggle by the tilling of the fields and the improvement of the land. This is precisely what farmers do. They help God, if one may say so; work with God in the cultivation of plants, the tending of livestock, and the care of their fellow men. There exists no calling of greater nobility here on earth. Therefore, I would direct these words to all husbandmen, but first and foremost to our bridegroom of today: You sons of the soil whose labour is unending and leisure scanty, know, I bid you, how exalted is your vocation. Agriculture is work in co-operation with the Creator Himself, and in you is He well pleased.\\" (p. 25)I am intrigued by the repeated references to the \\"religion of the Persians\\" and to its appropriateness for the story. This quote,and its irony, reminds me of the sermon in \\"Moby Dick\\", a book which shares in its obscurity and in its questing character many of the qualities of this one. The speech shows the author's ability to adopt material from little-known traditions into his own ideas and work, and to make them live for the reader. It was one of the qualities that leapt out at me in my second reading of \\"Independent People.\\"This book remains a little-known masterpiece. It will reward those readers willing to take the time with it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Having just read INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, I feel as though I have been drawn into the vortex of some great hurricane and am being carried around the globe by it, high above the surface, trapped in its gravity.This story has captured me and will not let me go. It is above all the heroic struggle of a Viking farmer to be free and his refusal to grieve in loss and defeat that grip me. He never grieves. Why then did I continually grieve for him? And why am I grieving for him still?The answer must be that my character is weak in comparison.

To enjoy it most, a reader should probably have lived at least a thousand years."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This novel looks nostalgically at rural life in Iceland and regrets the effects of a market economy on rural people with simple wants and needs. The protagonist, Bjartur of Summerhouses, is an obstinate, reactionary, and sometimes cruel herdsman who nonetheless possesses fine perception. Through this book, we learn a lot about the ecology of Iceland (it's a nice place to visit but don't try to raise sheep there), Bjartur, his family, and the society he belongs to. Author Halldor Laxness makes you appreciate the difficulties these people face but can also make you laugh out loud when he satirizes Bjartur's neighbors and the local gentry. I was impressed with this book and read many passages to my family. Unfortunately, there are also parts of the book where not much of interest happens for what seems like 50 or 75 pages at a time. I'm tempted to say that this would have been a better book if it were shorter but then Laxness won the Nobel Prize for literature and I didn't."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Every year, I try to read at least one classic work of fiction, whether I need to or not. So far in 1998, my choice has been Halldor Laxness' 1946 Nobel Prize winning novel Independent People. This is a book which I had never heard of until it was re-issued in English (the original is in Icelandic) in 1997. Laxness, who subtitles his work &quot;An Epic,&quot; tells the tale of sheep-farmer Bjartur of Summerhouses, and his life-long, monomaniacal struggle for financial independence. In the process, he loses two wives, a son leaves him, and his dearest child -- Asta Sollilja (&quot;Beloved Sun-Lily&quot;) -- is disowned. Only by losing all of his wealth does he find what he truly values. While styled &quot;an epic,&quot; this is also a whimsical and lyrical work. Bjatur, in addition to farming, is a bit of a poet, and the most remarkable extended scene is Bjatur's desperate struggle with bitter cold in the wilderness while trying to find a strayed sheep. In the middle of the night, to keep his senses and way, he returns to his muse:'Seldom had he recited so much poetry in any one night; he had recited all his father's poetry, all the ballads he could remember, all his own palindromes backwards and forwards in forty-eight different ways, whole processions of dirty poems, one hymn he learned from his mother, and all the lampoons that had been known in the Fourthing from time immemorial about baliffs, merchants, and sheriffs.'Ultimately, the poetry keeps him alive as he finally crawls his way on all fours to safety. I found myself reading this book in short doses so that I could savor the language, and so it would not end too soon. If someone was with me in the room as I read, I found myself inflicting upon them sentences or whole paragraphs, just to savor the felicity of language and expression. I concur with Jane Smiley's cover blurb: &quot;I can't imagine any greater delight than coming to Independent People for the first time.&quot; (Reading this novel and Smiley's remarks, it is clear where she derived many of the themes, descriptions, and grandeur in her 1988 novel Greenlanders. Smiley's work, however, is a much darker book)."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but I have only managed to read it once. This is a book you must brace yourself to read despite the absorption you feel while reading, because of the absolute dourness of the presentation of life in pre-WWII Iceland. I read this book while living in Reykjavik for an Icelandic literature course, and while it remains one of my most satisfying reads ever, it is also one which I am not in a hurry to repeat.Independant people is a tale of survival and self denial in Iceland, before its modernisation. The absolute brutality of the unforgiving living conditions, and Bjartur's unwillingness to lean on or borrow from other people shapes the life of his family, and their absolute poverty, which was unfortunately quite common in Iceland until WWII, when Iceland was liberated from the Danes, and they got freedom to trade with the rest of the world.The lyrical beauty of the writing contrasts sharply with the bleak life of Bjartur of Summerhouses, which revolves around sheep. Life in a turf house is explored in all of its depressing detail. The common beliefs in trolls and witches somehow fit into the landscape and lifestyle which most modern Americans would normally never be able to accept. The shaping of the Icelandic landscape, and how that has affected the people who live there is explored in a catalogue of gloom."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"It is incredibly and somewhat strangely satisfying for me, an 20 yr. old Icelander, to read foreign people's almost unanimous praise upon this masterpiece by my countryman Halld&oacute;r Laxness. I found, like many other reviewers, the book to have a profound and lasting effect on myself. It is a beutiful book, no matter how harsh or unconventional it may be. To those who find it boring I want to say this: If you cannot fathom the meaning of Sj&aacute;lfsttt f&oacute;lk, its uniqueness and wonderful insight into human nature (which is of course not at all restricted to where and when the book takes place), then the reason (blame?) probably is to find within yourselves - not Laxness. Laxness is forever implanted into Iceland's &quot;national soul&quot; as the author who changed and corrected our understanding of our past and present history. With Gerpla, he rewrote one of our loved sagas (F&oacute;stbrra saga). He shattered the glorified image of our ancestors and portrayed them in a manner that was unprecedented at the time. He showed them not as the blond-haired, eagle-eyed justice-seeking heroes that our independence fight in the 19. c. had envisioned but portrayed them as stubborn, dark and almost barbaric hoodlums with questionable morals, to say the least. And thus made them more believeable, human and interesting than ever. Many narrow minded and arrogant people of the time were shocked and appalled and he was even criticised for what was seen as &quot;lack of patriotism&quot;. Since then, historians have have come to the conclusion that his portrayal was much closer too the truth. Laxness was very controversial early in his lifetime (in the USA, the fact that he was a communist did not exactly do him well in the 50's or even onwards) although in the past decades he has rightfully been given his due as the genious he truly was. I will not elaborate further on the subject, although I could go on for (p)ages but urge people to read more of Laxness' work, especially &Iacute;slandsklukkan. In my opinion, it stands with Sj&aacute;lfsttt f&oacute;lk as his greatest work. If &Iacute;slandsklukkan has not been translated into English, I suggest that transscribers pull up their sleeves... quickly."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"In 1954, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to one Ernest Hemingway; his successor the year following was a considerably lesser known Icelander named Halldor Laxness. Yet Papa Hemingway would no doubt have felt both admiration and kinship with Laxness's stubbornly comical, almost tragic hero Gudbjartur Jonsson, in INDEPENDENT PEOPLE. Bjartur, as he is called, is undoubtedly one of literature's great single-minded characters, a Don Quixote of Iceland's punishing sheep country, a Candide devoted to the seemingly simple concept of personal independence. Unlike Sartre's spineless seeker of freedom, Matthieu Delarue (THE AGE OF REASON), however, Bjartur has both guiding principles and a backbone, although probably too much of both.The plot lines are surprisingly minimal for a book of nearly 500 dense pages. After eighteen years of working as a sheep-herder for the local (and wealthy) Bailiff, Bjartur scrapes up enough money to purchase a scrabbly piece of boggy land and a few sheep from his former employer. The land is rumored to be cursed, but Bjartur disdains these superstitions and resolutely forges ahead, optimistically naming his homestead Summerhouses. Refusing to assume debt or even ask for help in order to preserve his cherished independence, Bjartur of Summerhouses builds a sod house (the sheep live downstairs, the humans upstairs), slowly expands his flock through birthing, and marries a woman (Rosa) who dies alone in childbirth; Bjartur is out in a violent snowstorm searching for a sheep that he doesn't know his dead wife had cooked and eaten. The infant (named Asta Sollilja - Beloved Sun-Lily) only survives thanks to the body warmth of Bjartur's dog. Later, Bjartur marries again and fathers three boys (Helgi, Gvendur, and Nonni), as well as several stillborn children. His second wife dies, but Bjartur and his children eke out an existence that suddenly improves with the increase in price in Icelandic wool during World War I. Of course, this newfound wealth brings its own set of curses, luring Bjartur and his farming colleagues into building new, more modern houses. The intrusion of worldly affairs into Summerhouses also threatens the solidarity of Bjartur's family and results in breakup and tragedy, but also in a certain degree of good fortune. By the end of the story, Bjartur and his much-reduced family and flock are forced to set out for new land even further into the rugged north, recalling nothing so much as the ending of Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN.Plot and story is not really what INDEPENDENT PEOPLE is about. Laxness has penned a great satire of Icelandic mores and customs, turning Bjartur into the sort of close-minded, impossibly stubborn farmer who, the more he strives for independence, the greater and tighter are the shackles that bind him. Bjartur is surrounded by a colorful group of supporting characters, from the equally stubborn Asta and romantic Nonni to the other sheep farmers, the odd and slovenly Bailiff Jon, the politically ambitious Ingolfur Arnarson Jonsson (the Bailiff's son), the old grandmother Hallbera, and perhaps best of all, the Bailiff's wife, the Mistress of Rauthsmyri. The Madam Myri is a satirical triumph, an incessant worshipper of the noble peasants and their lifestyle while she lives in magnificent comfort and even complains of the burdens and unhappiness of being rich.Nearly everything is the subject of satire in INDEPENDENT PEOPLE. World War I becomes an insane exercise to kill ten million people over some guy named Ferdinand. The economics of socialization (rural cooperatives) versus capitalism (the merchants) becomes nothing more than the replacement of one set of heartless thieves bleeding the farmers with another set, both sets caring only about money and little about the farmers' lives. Modernization in the form of roads and bridges become just another way to help the rich get richer and to distract the young with dreams of the big cities and foreign lands. Even America is satirized as the distant land of impossible dreams, so that the word America becomes a pejorative for the young who leave their families to discover their own America. Of all these symbols, however, America appears to be the one with a positive side - youngest son Nonni leaves for America because he has been prophesied to be a great singer, one who will sing a song for the whole world to hear. We see little of Nonni after he leaves Summerhouses, but we can guess that he perhaps represents Laxness himself.INDEPENDENT PEOPLE is rich in its sense of place, drawing unforgettable pictures of the northern Icelandic sheep-farming countryside. Laxness's depictions of Nature are captivating, and his tales of struggle against the elements make the reader feel a part of the fight for existence. One scene, in which Bjartur nearly dies attempting to capture an elk during a snowstorm, is truly memorable. For all that, however, Laxness writes in a style that many readers will find slow and dense, reminiscent of authors like Thomas Hardy, George Elliot, or Charles Dickens. First published in 1945, this book shows its old-world, European novel roots. Nevertheless, patient readers will be amply rewarded; those expecting Grisham-style pacing will doubtless be unwilling to persevere. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves classical literature, looks for novels with a serious message and point of view, or simply wants to meet and savor a memorable story with classical pacing and an unforgettable cast of magnificently-drawn characters."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"The book is good and you should buy the paperback edition.

When the subtitle claims the novel is \\"an epic,\\" it's not kidding. According to Miriam-Webster, an epic is something \\"extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or scope.\\" In every sense of the word, this book is an epic. At times, the book travels into unnecessary spaces, gives us plot lines and characters that really don't go places. It's long. Very long. The prose is epic, too.But you know?

Wow! What a great book!"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"\\"Independence\\" is a word thrown around a lot, especially here in America where we think we have some kind of freehold on it. For much of its history, Iceland was a desperately poor land of sheep farmers and fishermen with a very small class of large landowners and merchants (often Danish) who kept the others in thrall. Halldor Laxness lived and wrote in the times when this age-old society was changing. He helped bring in the change, supporting a better life for his long-suffering countrymen, supporting socialism. If he had a slightly too rosy a view of Russian communism, he didn't, at least, have to live under a system so arbitrary and cruel. But what of a poor Icelander from \\"the back blocks\\" as the Australians say, who worked and struggled all his life to make a go of it, fighting the elements, predatory landowners, and supernatural enemies as well ? INDEPENDENT PEOPLE is the epic story of such a man, known as \`Bjartur of Summerhouses', who remains aloof from every enticement, every trend or opinion. He refuses to side with the cooperative movement, he refuses to kowtow to the local powers as well. To eat someone else's bread is the worst fate he can imagine. To avoid that, he will let his wives and children die, lose the surviving children to emigration or urban poverty, live his life in a leaky hovel, and refuse all help from whatever quarter. Above all, he isolates himself from his stepdaugher Asta Sollilja, who craves his love. He denies any feeling for her, or for anything except his sheep. Yet he will not be defeated. Stoic survival at last breaks to reveal the feelings Bjartur suppressed for years so that he could carry on. If you don't choke up at the end, you haven't got an ounce of emotion. He might well be Iceland itself---a tiny nation as the world counts nations--but always itself, always choosing its own path, no matter what the consquences.INDEPENDENT PEOPLE is one of the great novels of this world. If Laxness had not written other great books like \\"Salka Valka\\" and \\"The Fish Can Sing\\", his reputation would have been settled forever with just this one book. Pathos, love, courage, childhood, the beautiful but harsh landscape, the cries of marsh birds in the vast silence, the lives of rural Icelanders in the first quarter of the 20th century and their struggles for change---everything is portrayed by a master. How could you not read it ?"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Brad Leithauser, in his well-penned Introduction to my copy of this novel, writes that when asked what his favourite book (this one) is about, he replies, \\"Sheep.\\" - Very droll, but also accurate to a surprising degree - Leithauser, of course, goes on to expand in the Introduction. The reviewers here have done an excellent job of mapping the novel out and covering its themes, so that there seems little for me to add. I will say that this book is unlike anything else you'll ever read, save for the concluding pages, which bring to mind The Grapes of Wrath or some of Jack London's lesser read books such as The Iron Heel. This is a deeply poetic book about sheep and a particular man's, Bjartur's, struggle to be independent by means of them. What exactly this \\"independence\\" entails is material for a doctoral thesis. I think I'll just let Laxness do the talking here:\\"Forenoon, noon, and afternoon are as far off as the countries we hope to see when we grow up; evening as remote and unreal as death...\\" p.139\\"Few things are so inconstant, so unstable, as a loving heart, and yet it is the only place in the world where one can find sympathy.\\" P.147\\"...there is much comfort in the thought that time effaces everything, crime and sorrow no less than love.\\" P.226\\"...two human beings have such trouble in understanding each other, there is nothing so tragical as two human beings.\\" P.301\\"In its own way misery no less than revelry is varied in form and worthy of note wherever there lurks a spark of life in the world,\\" p.303These are just a few of the gems in this singular tale. Only four stars, because, well, aside from a few shining poetic passages of hopefulness (quickly crushed) the world portrayed here is mind-numbingly (for this reader anyway) bleak.

It is a wonderfully written book, although by no means a happy book. The plot is at times dark, but casts an intriguing look at human nature, relationships and a way of life. Laxness covers a multitude of issues and themes that are relevant even today and it is amazing to think that this book was written in the late 1940s. The story is the life of Bjartur an independent person, his family and his farm, Summerhouses. He is a farmer, raising sheep, facing similar difficulties and harsh realities as farmers face today, but his connection with the animals sets him apart from contemporary farmers. Bjartur's complex relationships with his family and the landed members of society and his straightforward relationship with his animals allows for a twisting plot and surprising turn of events. Although the book was of particular interest to me, having traversed Iceland on horseback recently (the horse that Bjartur owned has the same name as one of the horses I rode), but it does not preclude people who have never been to Iceland to feeling the same way as I did. Laxness somehow manages to engulf the reader, making one want to read on and on. The reader is hooked by him creating an interest, as well as concern or care towards Bjartur and his family. Most of the story is seen through the eyes of Bjartur, but by changing briefly to the point of view of the daughter and son, gives the story a smooth rounded feeling. This allows the reader to understand the complex feelings of the children, as well as conceptualize how they see and feel about their surroundings and life. The writing is fluid and the story and events unfold easily. I would categorize the writing style to be minimalist in areas, as Laxness leaves things unsaid or just uses one word to describe an incident. Allowing the reader to get involved by using their imagination. Because of this strong writing style, it is hard to believe that the book is a translation. It makes one wonder what the Icelandic version must be like. The only disappointment of the book is the introduction by Brad Leithauser. It is frustrating to see that he was unable to write an introduction to the book without divulging some of the key aspects of the plot. Not only is that unnecessary, but very unprofessional. I, therefore, recommend reading the introduction after finishing the book."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is a great novel. The story is engrossing and the characters are convincingly human. However, I would recommend that the reader find out something about Iceland before tackling it. It is very helpful to have a feel for the Icelandic landscape and a little bit of knowledge of the country's history before picking up this book. It also helps to read a few of the Icelandic sagas first. \\"Egil's Saga\\", \\"The Burning of Njal\\", and/or \\"Hrafnkel's Saga\\" would be good ones to read. They are readily available in English translation.If I hadn't read several of the sagas first, and found out a bit about Iceland, I would miss a lot of what Laxness is talking about in this novel.The book needs a better translation. The translator's use of archaic and uncommon English words is distracting. For example, the word \\"bigging\\" is used on the first few pages to denote the ruins in the valley. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines this as an \\"archaic\\" word meaning \\"building.\\" It comes from the Old Norse and is close to a Modern Icelandic word meaning 'settlement, habitation'. Maybe the translator chose 'bigging' because it was close to Laxness' original Icelandic word. He also uses 'ling' instead of the far more common word 'heather'. 'Ling' is another word from Old Norse which is probably close to Laxness' original Icelandic, but most English readers won't understand it. Bad choice for the translation.There is a man called \\"the Fell King\\" (Most English readers wouldn't know that Fell = mountain. I wonder why the translator didn't call him \\"the Mountain King\\".)There are probably many other significances to the names of people and places which I never caught on to. Some of these could be relayed to the reader by the translator.The book needs a fresh English translation to make it more accessible to the average reader."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"A powerful novel, well written, fascinating, heartbreaking, surreal and realistic at the same time. One of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"First published in 1946, this Icelandic author later won the Nobel Prize for Literature and I can well understand why. Set in the late 19th and early 20th century, this 482-page novel is as haunting as the cold and frozen landscape it describes. It was the choice of the international literature group at my local bookstore and paints a picture of the world of Bjartur of Summerhouses, a sheep farmer who is determined to live an independent life, dependent only on himself in the cruel and cold landscape of an Iceland steeped in natural beauty.For Bjartur and his family there is nothing but hard work and disappointment. He is as cold and stubborn as the world he lives in and, after 18 years of servitude, he is determined to live an independent life, barely eking out a living as a sheep farmer in an inhospitable land.Bjartur represses his emotion and presents as frozn an exterior as the land. There is little or no food; it is always cold; his first and then his second wives suffer from loneliness, illness and cold and his children are always hungry, half-starved and overworked. The world the author creates is cruel. The men are aggressive and hate each other; the women and children are overworked and if there is any love in this story, it is the love for the sheep rather than that for human beings.And yet, in spite of the melancholy tone throughout, the book is a small masterpiece. The characters all suffer, but there is a strong streak of determination throughout and, in a way, an understanding of the cruelty and hardship which so shape the their lives. This is not a pleasant book to read. But it is certainly worthwhile and well deserves all the accolades that make it a classic."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is a book you will remember and return to your entire life. It is the intimate story of an Icelandic sheep farmer, Bjartur, and his struggle to maintain the independence of himself and his family. But what is independence? Bjartur's proud and eternal insistence on refusing assistance from all who offer demonstrates that attaining the goal of being \\"independent people\\" is a never-ending struggle that leads to poverty - both the material and spiritual kind. Bjartur could certainly use some assistance; he and his family eke out a poor living on a remote farm, and he is an aloof difficult man. Despite the limited scope of the novel - there are few characters beyond Bjartur's family, and the entire novel takes place mainly on his small farm - it has the grand sweeping feel of an epic. Perhaps that is because the author confidently and expertly sprinkles bits of wisdom about the human condition throughout the book; these are beautiful, sad, nostalgic observations. The tone of the story is surprisingly uplifting, especially considering that Bjartur's life can't be described as happy or easy, except when it comes to his daughter Asta. Their complex relationship forms the core of the book and is worthy of a Shakespearean play. Although their proudly independent natures cause them to spend several years apart, at the end of the book they have reunited to continue the struggle."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"There are already many, many beautiful and eloquent 5 Star reviews here for this 1946 masterpiece novel by the 1955 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Halldor Laxness. I could not possibly better any of them or add anything that has not already been mentioned. I just want to say that novels such asIndependent Peopleare why I love to read and this is by far one of my most beloved books.I was reminded recently of this great Icelandic tale when I read a new English translation of a 2006 Danish novel by Carsten Jensen,We, the Drownedwhich follows much in this Nordic tradition of storytelling. I was reminded of how very much I loveIndependent Peopleand how I should make time to read this splendid story yet again. If you have never experienced a Halldor Laxness story, YOU MUST! I would recommendIndependent Peopleas an excellent introduction to the magnificent and complex narrative art of Iceland of which Laxness is genius.Laxness was born near Reykjavik, Iceland in 1902 and is the undisputed master of Icelandic fiction. His fiction is famous for its lyrical description of the Icelandic landscapes, its people and their relationship with the land and sea, its social and national issues, its history and its mythology.InIndependent Peoplehe depicts the tough, challenging life of the poverty stricken sheep farmers in Iceland's vast and brutal wilderness, their relationship with their environment, their struggles to climb from and stay out of debt. The times are hard and grim, when events such as the First World War are beginning to have tremendous impact on Iceland. The lifestyle of a sheep farmer is becoming more and more tenuous. The sheep farmer's life is a never ending battle with the elements, poverty, religion, society, government...and keeping the sheep alive.The primary character is Bjartur, a cantankerous and stubborn, determined and proud sheep farmer. He is insensitive and cannot express his emotions. He trusts in little, save his dog, his horse, his sheep... and himself. After eighteen years of slaving for another man, Bjartur is obsessed with becoming an independent man. Maintaining and protecting that independence is above and beyond everything else in his life, including his wife and his children. Bjartur is a man who is as harsh as the environment that surrounds him, yet he possesses qualities which command respect, and even affection. After all, he loves Icelandic poetry and recites it frequently!Also vital and important to the story is Bjartur's bastard child, the spirited and beautiful daughter, Asta Solilija, the \\"Beloved Sun-Lily.\\" Father and daughter are each that which is also the novel's perfect title ~ independent people.\\"We Icelanders have never had any great respect for kings...for everyone is equal before God; and as long as a farmer can call himself an independent man and no one else's slave, so long can he call himself his own king.\\"Independent Peopleis a gloriously engaging novel; it is beautiful, lyrical, poetic. It is neither grim nor heavy, but deeply felt and moving. It is storytelling rich with warmth and humor, storytelling that makes the reader laugh and cry and embrace its humanity.I love this book so much and consider it one of the best novels on my bookshelf. My original copy has been read to shreds and I must replace it as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"What an amazing discovery--this beautiful and heart-rending novel by Iceland's great literary magnate, Halldor Laxness! It seems as if the country's whole heroic and terrible history is somehow encapsulated in this story of one family's doomed (but not meaningless) struggle to emerge from feudalism... The time is the early 20th Century; yet, as I began the book, I was convinced I was reading about the Middle Ages, and was only gradually undeceived...The chief character, the deeply flawed and exasperating Bjartur, is a poet of the heroic spirit, his imagination shaped and limited by his country's ancient ballads and oral legends. A pagan with no belief in the soul, he scorns softer emotions and makes a religion of independence, endurance, and identification with nature in its harshest aspects. He exemplifies the pride that makes no room for compromise. Two wives and a number of children are pitiably sacrificed to his intransigence.Some beautiful and terrifying incidents (short stories really) are contained within the whole of this saga. One involves a reindeer ride which may or may not have been halucinatory; another a portentous trip to town with the fragile Asta Sollija, Bjartur's favorite child; a third a son's aborted love affair and collapse of his plan to escape to America. It is interesting and gratifying to note the humor the author can inject into sometimes horrendous material. He also reveals a touching love for animals and interest in imagining their feelings. Without undue sentimentality, he communicates convincingly the poor, lice-ridden dog who worships Bjartur, the sheer joy of a cow when released to a pasture after having been cooped up all winter, and her sorrow for her slaughtered calf.In the manner of Victorian novelists, Laxness can editorialize on occasion. For instance, he is not embarrassed to inform us that the aforementioned cow suffers from \\"depression.\\" And at one point he observes that \\"there is nothing so tragic as two human beings trying to understand each other.\\" Amen.Plaudits galore for this one!"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I was drawn by the \\"Nobel Prize in Literature\\" designation of Mr. Laxness.And, I think, this book came recommended to me as somewhat of a commentary on the industrialization effect on a somewhat pristine environment (i.e., a landscape / agriculture as yet un-impacted by industrialization...even as recent as the 20th century). Regardless of the reason for finding it, this is a GREAT book. Some reviewers say \\"too long\\", some say \\"dull and boring\\" in parts; yes, some parts don't give the immediate satisfaction of \\"character development\\" as, say, a SITCOM, but when did we lose our perspective? A good book needs character building. A good book needs plot and contextual development. A SITCOM, without qualification, needs one-liners to grasp the short attention span of the audience. Hence, a great book, as this one is, must do both of those things, character building & plot development exceptionally well. As another reviewer mentioned, with all its ups and downs, and as engrossing as it is, it's hard to believe this book was not originally written in English.

The story of Bjartur of the Summerhouses and his rebelious daughter Asta Sollilja kept me from putting it down. What else could the daughter have done but want to get away from her father- he is a very strong willed man and not a whole lot of fun to be around. But then, in the end, after Asta falls for the poet who breaks her heart, she rejoins her father, and the book's ending is one I'll always remember. This novel is set in a remarkably poetic landscape: the barren fjords and hinterlands of Iceland. It is a tale of small town folks and city folks and animals, and author Halldor Laxness definitely deserved the Nobel Prize. Time permitting, I hope to one day read more of his canon, as well as fellow northerner Knut Hamsun (who Laxness's writing reminds me of). In conclusion, what this novel gave me was the sweet and epic story of a father and daughter. Read this one in the winter season. --Alex Sydorenko"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Most of the above reviews say quite well some of the beautiful and wonderful things about this book, so I will simply say that Independent People is clearly a masterpiece.

It is a timeless masterpiece about all of us."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Set in Iceland, it's hard to believe that it is the twentieth century, to judge by Bjartur's isolated and rugged life. His fierce need to be an independent man inspires the admiration of the Icelandic ideal and the worry of the parish that feels a need to intervene in the harsh toll it takes on his family. Bjartur seems to love his sheep more than the humans of his family. The poverty is very hard. It's interesting to see the unique features of life in his rural country and amusing to see how these people make a really big deal out of a cup of coffee."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I don't think anything I write here in this review will fully justify this book, it's just too amazing.

I finally got around to reading it recently during a book clean out. Why did I wait so long? Laxness has written a beautiful, haunting tale set in the early twentieth century.The story centers around a very independent man, Bjartur who wants to raise his sheep without being beholden to any one. He has married and his wife is pregnant with a child that isn't his. While out minding his sheep she dies in childbirth. Upon arriving home, the baby--a daughter--is still alive. Bjartur decides to raise her as his own. He names her &Aacute;sta S&oacute;llilja.Bjartur spent 18 years saving money to buy his own croft or farm. He wants to be independent and depend on no one. Year after year he wages a war against the harsh Icelandic landscape, the ghost of the croft, and the people around him that don't live up to expectations. Bjartur is uncompromising in his principles and comes off as a harsh unbending man, much like the climate and land he is battling for supremacy. As you fall deeper into the story you will laugh, cry and triumph with Bjartur and Asta.This is literature at its best and shows just why Laxness, the author was most deserving of the Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"In this formidable saga about the conquest of individual independence Halld&oacute;r Laxness exposes his outspoken views on mankind, politics, economics and literature.Vision on man and womanFor Halld&oacute;r Laxness's protagonist, \`it is freedom that we are all after. I say for my part that a man lives in vain, until he is independent. For desire for freedom runs in a man's blood, as anybody who has been servant to another understands.'But, isn't the life of the independent man, in its nature, not a flight from other men who seek to kill him?His respect of women doesn't go further than \`from my experience of women folk most of them want to be raped, more or less.'Conquest of independenceThe protagonist has \`the heroic spirit of the first settlers\`. It is \`a man who had broken new soil; a man who also had faith in his country, and who showed it in his deeds.'But his search of independence is a terrible struggle against a harsh climate, against the economy's short booms and long busts and against debt: \`Is their freedom worth as much as the worms that feed from eternity to eternity on the bags of skin and bones they call their sheep?'Doesn't the independent man sow his enemy's field all his life, day and night? Are those who are struggling for independence not far better off, more independent, in prison?The Lord's Prayer of the independent farmer sounds as follows: \`Our Father, which art in Heaven, yes, so infinitely far away that no one knows where You are, almost nowhere, give us this day just a few crumbs to eat in the Name of Thy Glory, and forgive us if we can't pay the dealer, and our creditors and let us not, above all, be tempted to be happy.'All too relevant vision on economics and politicsPure capitalism is not the solution. The few steal everything from the many. \`I hold that people aren't big enough criminals to live under this system. Folk, the masses, aren't big enough bloody rogues ... and we aren't armed either.'What we need is organized solidarity: the lone-worker will continue to live \`in affliction as long as man is not man's protector, but his worst enemy.'What makes a politician \`a great man is first and foremost his ideals, his unquenchable love of mankind, his conviction that the people need improved conditions of life and better facilities of cultural advancement, his determination to mitigate his follower's sufferings by establishing a better government, instead of a helpless puppet in the hands of oppressors.'LiteratureThe protagonist is also a bard, bawdy and outspoken; not one of those who \`crawl around licking a woman's feet, like these love poets do nowadays'; and not one of those \`cheap poets and misanthropists and liars (who) write books full of sunshine and dreams to fool, ridicule and insult (their readers).'With such moving and unforgettable scenes, like the birth of the first child, the funeral of his first wife, the boy's awakening, the first night out of the daughter with her \`father' or the reuniting of the \`father' and \`daughter', Halld&oacute;r Laxness wrote a formidable and poignant masterpiece.This novel is an immense literary highlight and a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I have only just begun to read this book-(less than halfway through)- and I am captivated by the human-ness.

It's not only about Iceland, it's about all of us. Great book. Enormous but you get hooked to it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Bjartur of Summerhouses, is a sheep farmer and in Independent People Laxness has written what he describes as an 'epic' about Bjartur's life-long struggle for independence from the grip of his freezing and humble Icelandic background. In his struggle to gain financial independence Bjartur loses so much, a son who deserts him, two wives and even his favourite daughter or \\"Sun Lily\\" as he calls Asta Sollilja is ultimately disowned.To relieve his struggle Bjartur attempts to write poetry and even when lost in the bitter cold of his Icelandic trail searching after his lost sheep in the middle of the night, it is poetry to which he turns to retain his sanity and to comfort him for all that has sunk so low in his attempts to raise a happy family.If there is a moral to the story then it's that only by sacrificing all that he has earned does he find what he most values.I think that the integrity of the author goes without question but at times I lost sympathy with Bjartur for seeming to be more concerned about losing his sheep than losing his boy. I concede that this only makes Bjartur the more individual and its greatly to Laxness's credit that he is very far from any self-conscious attempt to produce a stereotypical 'likeable' character in Bjartur on a 24/7 basis. Would anyone who wasn't a fiction qualify ?"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Laxness, a Nobel-prize-winner, gives an amazing account of what it was like to live in medieval conditions in a fishing village in remote neighborhood of Reykjavik at the turn of the twentieth century. His novel moves chronologically, like a saga, and like a saga, accords dignity to each character. Laxness has tenderness towards the boy he was who went from complete ignorance to citizenship in the European intellectual community, and great humor and fondness for the characters that this boy came to know as a foster child of an elderly fishing family whose house was a hostel for the dying and those who died by going to America."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I bought Independent People after spending two weeks in Iceland this summer. It's a fascinating and moving account of a traditional farmer's life, and provides a nice complement and further insight to the folk museums that I visited. The protagonist, Bjartur, is at times frustrating and cruel, but I still feel sympathetic toward him and his unwavering desire to be an independent man. (I can't stand books in which I end up hating the main character!)As much as I'm enjoying the book itself, the Kindle version of Independent People has some problems, as has been noted in previous reviews. Perhaps many of the typos have been fixed since the earliest version, but I am still noticing typos and inappropriate italicizing every few pages or so. I purchased this book for $15.34, comparable to the print version, so it is disappointing to see these interruptions in flow.I didn't email Amazon about this or demand a refund because it's not that bad, but hopefully Kindle versions of Independent People and other older books can be improved."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I read Independent People after visiting Iceland this summer, and having that context was great. Great writing and scope. It's difficult to understand the motivations of the main character, and I think the writing of the Sagas (so I'm told) and how they depict events is similar. But the description of life on the farm is worth the read. Also interesting is the role of debt in Icelandic life, which reminded me of the recent financial crisis and how things haven't changed that much (at least in that regard!).

By the end I thoroughly enjoyed it and was impressed by the characters, and the progress that Iceland had made in a generation."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Laxness, an Icelandic author, won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1955 for his ability to create epic tales. This is certainly one of them. It's the story of Bjartur, an Icelandic sheep farmer who is set like a mountain in his ways. He stubbornly bears the loss of family members, attacks on his sheep, political corruption and the changing world around him, set on his goal to live independently and build his home and farm, Summerhouse.\\"Yes, it was a good man indeed who could stand immovable as a rock in these times, when everything around him, including money and views of life, was afloat and swirling in perpetual change; when the strongest boundary walls between men and things in time and place were being washed away; when the impossible was becoming possible and even the wishes of those who had never dared to make a wish were being fulfilled.\\"The most interesting conflict though, better than Bjartur's conflict with the world, is his stubborn feud with his equally strong-willed daughter, Asta Solilja. The pig-headed way in which Bjartur disowns his daughter and refuses to make amends makes you hate him, but in the end, as he is weighted down by debt and loneliness and finally begins to admit regrets, it's hard not to feel for Bjartur. For his entire life, he has been principled to a fault, but principled nonetheless. It is then, as he looks over Summerhouse, ruined by poor financing and poor construction, that he writes:\\"For what are riches and houses and powerIf in that house blooms no lovely flower?\\"Independent People is a book that at times feels like it is being endured, much as Bjartur endurs the harsh northern winters. While there are moments of action, sharp conflict and shocking surprise, much of the novel is concerned with the various diseases that infect the sheep, descriptions of the weather and landscape, the politics of socialism and the poems that Bjartur enjoys writing and reciting. It's rewarding in the end, but is a slog to get through. It has been compared to Tolstoy. The story at times also reminded me of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, though I would be quicker to recommend that book. As frustrating as it is at times, by recommending Independent People to someone, I'd worry that they might return and throw the book at me."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"As a traveler to Iceland, this book acts as an invitation into Icelandic culture from what is customary to serve visitors to what many Icelanders talk about over coffee. Laxness puts you at the table to watch this tragic story unfold before you. You want to interact with the characters, not just worry about them. The ups and downs in the plot can change the mood of your day (so try to end on a good note).The book is broken into short sections that can be read in one day. I recommend this book as a cornerstone to any library."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I read this after getting acquainted with several sagas, in particular Njal's Saga. Later I read some shorter sagas in Norwegian. I read Independent People (by happy accident, it was on the shelf in my home town in Kentucky) during the time that my oldest daughter was being treated unsuccessfully for anorexia/bulemia. Several years later I discoverd Pig Earth and all the other books by John Berger. They also became my 'bibles'."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"While not an easy book to read, it is well worth the effort. It is easy to over analyze this book, as is most great literature, but you do not have to spend time searching out its eternal truths. In the end, like with any good book, its most interesting feature is that you become taken and drawn into a place and people that you would normally never imagine having anything to do with. And when you consider that the place is a sheep farm in the middle of Iceland with a main character who seems to have no redeeming qualities, you will be amazed in the end that you had to keep reading to find out what would happen next. And in the end, you will realize that the author, and in this case translator, have taken you on a marvelous journey."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I found this most unusual book by accident. Simply put, Laxness should be much more widely-known. His writing is spare and beautiful. Independent People is depressing, but in a good way, the way that makes you feel you've learned something about life. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"If military brats can identify with &quot;the great Santini&quot;, I had a similar experience with Bjartur. My father was an only child, a Jutland farm boy whose mother died as a result of his birth. He was raised about the time frame of this book by housekeepers in a thatched roof farmhouse with a barn at one end. (This is all similar to portions of the storyline, although it happens to differing characters and in Iceland rather than Denmark.) He came to the US alone at age 18 and his father refused to communicate with him for years afterward. As with Bjartur, once you leave, you leave. Until Bjartur started acting differently toward the end of the book, I knew what his every move was going to be. Just as Bjartur thought he needed to be totally independent to survive, and was sometimes cruel (and stupid) in behaving that way, my father thought similarly; though they both meant well. From a sociological standpoint, through this book, I discovered some of the bases for my father's psyche. The translation is very readable. The poetry is better incorporated in the story than the verses in Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy. It is a pleasant experience reading poet's prose, be it, Nelson Algren, Jorge Borges or Halldor Laxness. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This 1955 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature is unlike any book you will ever read. It is a multigenerational tale focusing on the bleak, oppressive living conditions of rural Iceland in the early twentieth century, in particular on one Bjartur of Summerhouses, a sheep farmer who is fiercely independent. Although the book is subtitled \\"an epic,\\" perhaps it should instead be titled \\"a depressing, satirical epic that actually makes you laugh once in a while.\\" This is by no means an easy read. Weighing in at almost 500 pages, this dry, plodding tome spends whole chapters wading through minute details on local politics and the economy with an attentive (and infuriating) sort of calm. The story itself is almost painful to read at times, oscillating between delightful humor and black despair. It relates, for example, Bjartur's delight in rolling big rocks from cliff-tops and watching them fall (who doesn't like doing that?), while later describing the slow starvation and eventual death of his flock one spring. Our hero is infuriating, bullheaded, and stubborn, but reassuringly human at his core, allowing the reader to cheer him on, once in a while, as he blunders his way through life. Independent People is an admirable, poetic novel, by turns both masterful and agonizing on the nerves. It's the kind of book that one will appreciate having read at least once, but not plan to revisit anytime soon."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"I don't know how a novel could be any better.

Laxness manages to capture the harshness of the Icelandic natural environment and the Icelanders' resilience to it. His imagery echoes several themes found in the Icelandic sagas. All in all one of the essential books, which I hope everyone will read."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Jean F.Leotard once said that a great author strives to write the book that can not be written and Independent People is such an outstanding book. It is a book rich in contrasts and humanity and yet written with the mastery of some minimalism. It is a very tough story yet tender and poetic; tragic and hopeful; melancholic and very funny; Bjartur is so wise and so dumb at the same time. Sometimes Laxness stretches the story a bit too far as when Bjartur is more devastated by the loss of a sheep than the loss of his boy... Yet, even that somehow adds to the consistency of Bjartur's character and I consider Bjartur to be one of the most memorable characters ever captured in print. The Independent People will be cherished by any reader who enjoys the strength and excellent perception into human nature of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"J. A. Thompson does justice to Halldor Laxness' tremendous talent, as his translation is eloquent. Regarding the setting, anyone who has a relative or friend who lived in Scandinavia and worked as a poor farm laborer during the earlier part of this century should go and have a long conversation with that person. It might start to sound familiar. The Bjartur character is actually quite comedic in that I constantly found myself thinking &quot;No, no, Bjartur, don't do that! You idiot!&quot; He exemplifies the worst face of capitalism: Even though he is a tremendously hard-working soul, he is just a little too uneducated, stubborn, and unwise to be able to succeed as an independent farmer. He never sees opportunity, even when it knocks. He insists on raising sheep, even if the market is low. When he finally gets a break, he ends up spending more money than he takes in. To understand the lure of communism to those people who couldn't find a way to succeed in their capitalistic environment, read this book. Having just traveled to Iceland, I came home with the impression that today's Icelander is quite educated, cosmopolitan and living in a strong economy. (Thankfully, I met no Bjarturs.) And one more thing: Will someone please translate &quot;&Iacute;slandsklukkan&quot;? I have the Icelandic version, but it will take a century to read it."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"This is not a review of the book, but a review of the Kindle Edition.

He build his own hut, marries a servant from the household of his former boss and becomes and Independent Person.What follows is a chain of unfortunate events and misery: his first wife dies when giving birth, his second wife dies when he slaughters her favorite cow, most of his children die, the whole family os constantly hungry, the sheep have diarrhea or worms or both and in the meantime it does not stop raining.Despite everything Bjart struggles on. And then WW 1 starts and everybody wants to buy Icelandic wool and mutton. Finally the farmers get a decent price for their sheep. And then Bjart finally pushes his luck and the books ends like it begins: with a moving to a new house.An interesting theme and the book is at times very nice to read, but at other times it is enormously long-winded and the discussions between the small farmers are at times completely incomprehensible."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"In the introdution, the author is quooted as saying that he thought the hero of this srory, Bjartur, was stupid.

I wanted to becuae the intro as so adulatingx of it and tjh author is the only Nobel prize winner from Iceland., but it is not intersting enough.Bjartur is doing what he can to make a life for himself on a homestead that is way out in the boonies and may be haunted, but it was what he could afford after working eighhteen (18) yeas to save for it. As far as I got, he had made a good gfo of it. He was not getting rich, but he was holding his own.What galled me was that he kept harping on how he was an independent person, as was his wife. But he was not independent of the mechants who bought his wool, or the people who helped him, and he helped them, gather in the sheep for the winter or in other things. Philsosophically, a persons independence is always bounded by social, economics and nature.

I won't deny the high quality of writing for the story and some considerable subtlety in showing the movement of modernity and politics onto an agricultural community. Nevertheless it shares the same basic aesthetic problem as Growth of the Soil; in binding the plot to the development of agriculture it makes for a pace much to slow to drive consistent interest. Under the stress of little happening beyond interaction with the characters, these individuals are forced under a level of depiction that doesn't benefit them. It's not that they're overly simple, rather they are unpleasant, being too dysfunctional and strongly petty to have much interest in rooting for them. That makes the continued long term presence of them with little that they do to take the novel outside of them rather exhausting.I'm ambivalent as to the effectiveness of the main and titular theme of the novel. A lot of the book is about putting forth notions of freedom, and the protagonist's desire to live as a free man against all obstacles. To a large extent this ambition is contextualized and deconstructing, making some rather satisfying representations of it as petty and largely incapable, showing wider social complexities and government moving in beyond any sort of juvenile Heinlein-esque focus on the rugged autonomous individual. In the moments of showing contradiction, and the way this independence can be born on the subordination of others, the novel achieves some strong insights and real interest. Yet it seems at the end to come down on some level to admiration of this desire for total independence taken as a behavioral approach and ideal. I may be misreading it, and to an extent my frustrations with the aesthetic experience may have blunted my grasp of the subtlety of the ultimate message. Still, as I see it presently the story appears to side uncritically with the rather disjointed individualist view in a way that undermines itself. Not least due to how unplesant the protagonist is.Better than: Growth of the Soil by Knut HamsunWorse than: The Forgotten by Elie Wiesel"},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Laxness weaves a tale over a generation with the trials and tribulations of being a sheep herder on a haunted clearing in the near Arctic.

Bartjur, the shepherd, loves his independence more than his family and life itself.In the end, his lessons are learned by his children who each take to heart the father's ways, but all in their own ways.

It was beneficial in getting me to sleep earlier, so I'll give it two stars."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"If you're interested in Icelandic life, Scandinavian lit., or the strange intuitions of the Nobel Prize committee, this book is for you. Oh yes, if you are a Thomas Hardy fan you might find the work of this Nordic disciple fascinating. (The author never lets you forget he's read Dostoevsky and all the sagas as well.)Otherwise, you may find it, as I did, a prolix chronicle of unremitting tragedy. The author's ironic attitude to his protagonist is not sufficient to answer the question why anyone bothers with this wretched account of a man who destroys everyone who comes under his meager authority, mainly for the sake of his ego. The book is gloriously written and/or translated. I don't know Icelandic, so I don't know how much the translator contributed. The characters are vibrant and memorable. The landscape is exotic. I can see why Laxness won the Nobel Prize. So the surface is good, but underneath, it's an Ingmar Bergman version of Little House on the Glacier.This book would benefit greatly from a few footnotes. Laxness evidently thought he would only be read by Icelanders, so there are a lot of customs, implements, and other details that need some explaining. Also, skip the frivolous intro by Brad Leithauser. After all, the book does have some of the greatness of tragedy to it, which Leithauser seems to miss entirely. Not only that, he gives away a lot of the plot, and utterly misinterprets the most fascinating feature of the book, the interplay between folklore and day-to-day life, an exploration of how the harsh life of the Icelandic peasantry reenacts in a down-to-earth way the most horrific imaginings of mythology."},{"Title":"Independent People: An Epic","review":"Having enjoyed a couple of Danny Yee's other recommendations, read the superlatively effusive references on the cover (\\"..it is the book of your life..\\", \\"..one of the best books of the twentieth century. I can't imagine any greater delight than coming to Independent People for the first time...\\") and finding that Laxness snagged the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955, I thought, \\"What the hell,\\" and borrowed it from the local library.OK, sure, Laxness can write. He evokes this isolated, harsh, Spartan climate and existence, and the characters and idiosyncrasies of a family living in an Icelandic sheep farm ... but before you dive into this classic of our time, perhaps you should be warned that this is, not to put too fine a point on it, really tedious. OK, right, Bjartur is stubborn. Yes, he's fiercely independent. No, he doesn't like cows. We get it. No really, we've got it. Buddy, you've made your point. And it's not like there are clever ir insightful scenes along the way. Sure it's a relief when another character pops in, the surly minister or the condescending Baliff's wife, but these incidents only feel good because they're a relief from the general monotony - they don't stand alone. I stuck it out for a couple of hundred pages, and it gave me a lot more sleep (I tend to read in bed at night, and gripping books keep me up), but it became one of those books that I can't stay faithful to. Normally I'll manage serial monogamy, but along the way with this laborious tome I found myself tempted off towards other books that I actually felt like reading. It was like being back in school and having to drag myself through \`Great Expectations', or at uni with the similarly bloated \`Moby Dick' - except I'm not in school anymore (at least, not as a pupil), so Halld&oacute;r is heading back to the library half unread, and I'll get back to the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.

This civil war dwarfed all others of the 20th Century in scope and significance. The lives of tens of millions were lost or changed forever in the ensuing conflagration-from battle, disease, famine, imprisonment, execution, dislocation, and exile. New weapons of war emerged. The airplane, armored car, tank, and armored train wee tested over the vast expanses of Russia, the largest country in the world, in a war of mobility not seen on the relatively static fronts that characterized World War One. Even so, the older weapons of war remained. This was the last war in which cavalry armies duelled en masse, sword on lance. Bugles still rang and unfurled flags fluttered above infantry charging into the steel mouths of guns. More than two dozen countries took part in these torturous years of civil war. Peripheral regions of the former Russian Empire that had broken away to form new nations had to fight for independence: Finland, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Other countries directly intervened in the conflict as a consequence of events arising out of World War One, including Great Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Germnay, Austria-Hungary, Romania, Greece, the Ottoman Empire, and the United States. Still others participated in the fighting because their troops were trapped inside Russia at the end of World War One, such as Serbia and Czechoslovakia, or fought because the civil war spilled over into their territory, for example, Mongolia and China. At the end, the maps of Northeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Far East had to be redrawn. Soon after the 1917 February revolution, and the abdication of Czar Nicholas II, the White cause began to emerge and oppose the Bolsheviks. There was, however, no single, united White Army to fight the Red Army and the forces available to the Whites represented a spectrum of political factions including monarchist military organizations and Social-Democrats. Many of the Cossack hosts also sided with the Whites, seeing it as an opportunity to create their own independent states; others remained neutral or hostile to both sides. This fascinating book, THE RUSSIAN CIVIL WAR (2) WHITE ARMIES examines the colorful uniforms and the equipment of the White armies of the Russian Civil War. With that being said, there is one mistake that must be corrected in regard to the caption on Page 46. The initial deployment of 1,889 enlisted and 48 officers of the 12th, 13th, and 62nd Infantry Regiments of the 8th Infantry Division deployed to Russia on the USS Thomas in mid-August, 1918. This was followed by a second deployment of 1,886 on the USS Sheridan and 1,811 on the USS Logan in September, 1918 to Russia. Prior to the above deployments, were the deployments of the 27th and 31st Infantry Regiments from the Philippines on the USS Merritt, USS Crook, and USS Warren to Russia via Japan in early August, 1918. They were the first U.S. Army units to arrive in Vladivostok. Seventy-five U.S. Marines from the USS Brooklyn (the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet) were reinforced by fifty U.S. Marines from the USS New Orleans (it had sailed from Cavite, Philippines).Lt.

Some books seem very spritual in its handling of the subject. Others miss the mark completely. This book is different. It discusses the range of feelings that those of us who grieve for the death of a loved one expeirences. What makes this book a must read for the grieving is that not only is the author a professional therapist, but she writes from experience--she lost her first husband to cancer. She adeptly combines her professional and personal experiences in such a way that I felt as if she was talking directly to me. It helped validate my feelings and have provided me with a sign that I may be able to get passed my own grief. I have been recommending this book to others who are still mourning the passage of a loved one."},{"Title":"Chameleon","review":"Dorothy's story is sad and horrific in parts.

Biography)","review":"George Fox, 1624-91, is sometimes called the \\"founder\\" of the Religious Society of Friends, a group that established itself in the 1650s. Early on, they called themselves Children of the Light and Friends of the Truth. As the group spread from the North of England into the south, they became known as Quakers, a name which stuck and is still used today. In the early years, Fox was one of several strong personalities most closely identified with the movement. Later, facing severe persecution and with the death of other early leaders, the Friends accepted Fox's institutional guidance, and he helped the movement to consolidate and survive through to an era of somewhat greater tolerance toward the end of his century.Certainly Fox never set out to start another \\"religion.\\" He hoped simply to open the hearts of everyone to the leading of the divine Spirit, without allowing the existing distinction of clergy and laity. His journal, composed years after most of the events covered, retains Fox's direct, down-to-earth form of ministry. The language is not flowery, yet it brings up deep and powerful spiritual ideas, with strong imagery that still sparkles in Quaker language.\\"Now the Lord God opened to me by His invisible power that every man was enlightened by the divine Light of Christ, and I saw it shine through all; and that they that believed in it came out of condemnation to the Light of life, and became the children of it; but they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemned by it, though they made a profession of Christ. This I saw in the pure openings of the Light without the help of any man; neither did I then know where to find it in the Scriptures; though afterwards, searching the Scriptures, I found it.\\"This edition of Fox's Journal was abridged and edited by Rufus Jones in the early part of the last century, thus making it more accessible to a wider audience. However, some who dwell on the theological nuances and regard Fox as authoritative find this edition disappointing. (The John L. Nickalls edition of Fox's Journal is regarded as definitive.) Rufus Jones provides a helpful introduction, presenting briefly his own idea that Fox raised to a new level an already widespread movement of grassroots mysticism."},{"Title":"The journal of George Fox, (Everyman's library, ed. by E.

What the wolf really wants to eat is a boy. To avoid his mother's cooking one night, he tries the ploy of shouting \\"boy\\". It works- -his parents run out of the den in search of the boy and dinner is ruined. Of course, when a real boy actually appears in the neighborhood, the small wolf can't get a rise out of his parents, so he has to learn to eat lamb burgers after all. Some kids might find the book a bit scary, but for those who can handle the tension, it's a fun story. The book has about 1200 words."},{"Title":"The Wolf Who Cried Boy","review":"Writing is excellent and witty - one simply can't resist falling in love with a book that includes menu items such as \\"lamburgers\\" and \\"Granny Smith pie\\" - and the illustrations support it well. Better done than the run of the mill fairy tale parody, and thus far superior to the average fairy tale presentation.The humor is invaluable when trying to stuff a moral down kids' throats - they respond relatively well to being reminded that they are crying \\"Boy!\\" (especially when presented comically) - and it also helps them relax and back away from the precipitating issue.AND - it's a lot of fun to read aloud, especially if one hams up the voices.

The wordplay is delightful (\\"chipmunks and dip,\\" \\"muskratatouille\\"), and the cheerfully sick sense of humor (\\"there was nothing better than a steaming plate of Boy Chops, a big Baked Boy-tato, and some Boys-n-Berry Pie\\") is exactly what kids love. The illustrations have a quaint, old-fashioned cartoon aspect which perfectly suits the story.

The Scholars is an exception to this generalization. It is one of the masterpieces of the Chinese novel, but it is as fun for a contemporary American to read today as it was for Wu Ching-tzu's contemporaries to read in imperial China.This book is an incisive satire of hypocrisy and corruption among Confucian intellectuals. Although the circumstances of the stories will be unfamiliar to the general reader, this translation supplies supporting material that will help explain the context. And we immediately identify with the cast of characters and their catalogue of vices: arrogant officials, obsequious would-be officials, impoverished students who become exactly like those who exploit them as soon as they are given a chance, etc.Wu Ching-tzu's worldview is not wholly negative, though. There are characters in this world who have honor. We get the sense that the author believes that the true spirit of Confucianism is very different from the debased institutional form it has taken in his era.One brilliant but challenging feature of this work is that it is not a simple linear narrative. Wu Ching-tzu weaves the stories of individuals in and out of one another. One storyline will abruptly stop, seemingly abandoned; another storyline will begin; then the characters from the previous storyline will reappear in the new story. This is dazzling narrative, but sometimes a little hard to follow: I recommend that you scrawl some brief notes in the margins or the back of the book so that you can remember who a character is when he or she reappears somewhere down the road. (I did a chart myself.) Believe me, though, it's worth the effort to fully appreciate this book.This is a delightful, humorous, and humane novel that will transport you to another world, but leave you with insights into human nature that are universal."},{"Title":"The Scholars Rulin Waishi","review":"I must confess that I read with pure, unadulterated JOY this masterful tale of Wu Jingzu. &quot;The Scholars&quot; is an incredible work, and the translation presented here is masterful.I can add little to the excellent review below. &quot;The Scholars&quot; is a well-crafted satire displaying the virtues (few) and vices (many) of the Confucian scholar-officials of the early Ming dynasty. The tales are often humorous (sometimes, even slapstick), and though many of the conventions will be unknown to the general reader (such as wedding and funeral ceremonies, adoption principles, host-guest relationships, etc.), the gist of the novel cannot be missed.The good news here is this: now, only the hardcover version (available through FLP, Beijing) is available. This version has nicer paper, and the illustrations are much more clearly rendered (and there is a print-quality rendition of the author to lead off the text). Oh, did I mention that the hardcover version is fifteen dollars less than the paperback? Do yourself a favor and give this excellent collection of tales a try!"},{"Title":"The Scholars Rulin Waishi","review":"You have to be ready for this one and know what you're getting into. I especially enjoy Old China books. What a great culture. As many as I've read, this one was different. It is a translation yet keeps the Chinese vernacular and takes place during a period which transcends between the old Confucious teaching and the new thoughts. There is no hero or central character. It is about the process of becoming a scholar and the status of the stages in doing so. The various characters, and there are many, are in tune only to their own kind - not their moral attributes but their level on the learning ladder. They reach these levels with intense study and taking the tests of each of the levels. Only few are chosen and not necessarily the best, depending on the judging. Again, it is fascinating because it is different. Just don't expect a story of plots and heros. Know what you are getting."},{"Title":"The Scholars Rulin Waishi","review":"I have just begun reading, but I am totally encapitvatd. This is a very amusing tale, rather in the humorous spirit of \\"Journey to the West\\" (another which I've only just begun reading), and I am surprised how enjoyable they are. I was afraid it would be like reading Beowulf or Shakespeare, but the story was quite \\"modern\\" for the most part. That's what I want to say about this story: it's social satire and reads very well (likely due to the translation in many ways, no doubt; I have the Columbia University edition, which I suspect may be more lively than the one put out by the Bejing Foreign Languages Press). Reading this story is a wonderful and most educational contrast to learning about classical China in school. History is written by the elite, but this story has an Everyman's sensibility and pokes great fun at Chinese conventions and customs, many of which persist to this day."},{"Title":"The Scholars Rulin Waishi","review":"The third edition (1973), issued by the Foreign Languages Press, Peking, is the best-ever edition of this English translation by the Yangs.

The book is beautifully illustrated with sumptuous prints from the Renaissance and later kabbalistic treatises. The only negative point is his continual quoting of Mathers' Kabbalah Unveiled, which has been well superceded by the writings of Dion Fortune, Gareth Knight and Paul Foster Case. Highly recommended as an adjunct to the works of Gershom Scholem, Carlo Suarez, Louis Ginsberg. and Aryeh Kaplan."},{"Title":"Kabbalah: An introduction and illumination for the world today","review":"I am an [independent] Rosicrucian seeker, and tend to be very visual, as well as inspired by prose and poetry -- so, I very much appreciate the Inspiration of the Tree-of-Life and its Spheres and Paths. However, even the Western Esoteric [Tree-of-Life centered] Qabalah -- such as presented so well by Dion Fortune, Gareth Knight and Alan Richardson -- is an off-spring of Jewish Tradition, as well as various other Western Esoteric influences. Kabbalah is, indeed, much more than just the Tree-of-Life so well-known to general seekers.So, I have a double appreciation of this very interesting \\"introduction and illumination for the world today\\". Charles Ponce succeeds well in a good introduction to the roots, trunk and limbs of Traditional Mystical Jewish Kabbalah -- from early historical Hebrew and Biblical roots thru the Medieval Golden Age of Kabbalah into an illustrated comparison with other Western Esoteric tradition and with some parallel Eastern tradition.Of course, the CLEAR writting style of the author -- with MANY quotes, charts and pictures, in a rational reflective unfolding -- helps to make this book a pleasure to read, in order and out of order, for inspiration. That, with some deep inspiration via low slow mellow navel inhalation, and some Divine Grace, may help Grow a Rose on your Cross +++"},{"Title":"Kabbalah: An introduction and illumination for the world today","review":"I have read my lot of works about the Kabbalah (Kabala,Kabalah, Kabballah, Qabbalah, however you want to spell it), but noneis like Charles Ponc&eacute;'s work that is the subject of this review. Thebest part of this book is that Ponc&eacute; opens with a full history ofJewish literature and mystic and Rabbin traditional writings. This -ashe says himself- had never been done before. For full account, I'mtalking about the following works: Talmud, Misjn&agrave;h, Gemar&agrave;h, Midr&agrave;sj,Halach&agrave;h and Agad&agrave;h (forgive me if the English equivalents are writtendifferently). Given are explanations to what books and tradition theseterm refer and a brief history and description of the Jewishstreamings that are associated with them. Lengthy chapters about theSephen Jetsir&agrave;h, Zohar and shorter parts about 'less important'books. Clear information about the two forms of Kabbalism (practical,speculative), the links that can be made with astrology, the tarot,eastern philosophies. Of course explanation of the Hebrew alphabet andgematria, variations of the Sephirothic tree, explanations of theSephira, different views and variations of combinations. Then there isa large part about Kabbalistic teachings and doctrines and to closeoff Kabbalism in modern times. All the information you need to havefor a proper start with Kabbalism and a descent supplement for thosewho already work with the Kabbalah for some time. And that is arelative small book. Last point to mention (but not the least): thereare a lot of pictures in this book! ..."},{"Title":"Kabbalah: An introduction and illumination for the world today","review":"Ponce does a great job of outlining the history, tenets and traditions of Kabbalah. His descriptions, liberal use of illustrations and old symbolic drawings from the last 500 years, as well as the ease of the writing make the base information approachable for any reader. What I found most interesting, however, was the final section of the book on Kabbalah today, where Ponce approaches an analysis of Kabbalah in a theosophic way - comparing it to other traditions like Native American, Hindu and Buddhist - showing the common themes and roots among them, and the relevance of Kabbalah to any sincere seeker. This analysis and discussion alone is worth picking up the book to read - and the rest is real good too."},{"Title":"Kabbalah: An introduction and illumination for the world today","review":"This book offers the reader an extremely indepth look at the Kabbalah system. It covers the a wide range of topics: En-Sof, Death, the Ten Sefiroth, the Soul. More than most books I've come across. It is also chocked full of illustrations. It's only fault is not delving deeper into the tree of life. That would have made it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Kabbalah: An introduction and illumination for the world today","review":"Not bad, but too many quotes from others, drawings scattered strangely, and nothing really tangible. All seemed to be written 'too hod' and many things repeated in a strange structure. Go for the book below, this author actually did merkavah mysticism instead of searching for old quotes about it, and also provides and intro to Kabbalah.Trinity of Wisdom - Truth, Philosophy & Hermetic Alchemical QabalahOverall though, not a bad introduction."},{"Title":"More Folk Strums for Guitar","review":"This easy book for acoustic guitar playing has an amazing variety of strumming and picking styles, 25 in all---each with a song to illustrate its use. Book sections are: calypso songs (using some slap and rasgueado techniques), rhythm, folk blues, ballad style, and bluegrass/country (without a flatpick). There is no tab, rather musical scores, but the songs are well-known folk tunes from the sixties, and the instruction is clear, with drawings to picture some of the strokes. You will be sure to pick up many licks you did not know before with this book, 48 pages, 8X11, paperback. It's well worth the couple bucks for a used copy, and there aren't many around."},{"Title":"More Folk Strums for Guitar","review":"This out of print soft cover book arrived very quickly and in very good condition. The book was a sequel of sorts, to an earlier book by the same author, \\"Folk strums for guitar\\". I had read the earlier book when I was a teenager, and found it quite useful. But this later book, \\"More Folk Strums for Guitar\\" was wonderful! It had more unusual strums and percussion techniques for fingerstyle guitar players than I thought possible. It was a gold mine of useful information. If you are a fingerstyle player, get a copy of this little book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University","review":"The dust cover picture of armed students leaving Cornell's Straight Hall in April 1969 tells a story close to my heart in time and geography. Downs' wonderful study of student power shows the inevitable problems that emerged when well-intentioned university liberals surrendered their fundamental academic principles in the name of compassion. Downs illustrates the unintended consequences of affirmative action, from students who did not want so much to learn from the institution...they wanted to radically change the institution.The students understood politics, public relations and the power of the &quot;big lie&quot;. While they may not have been competent to lead Cornell through needed change, Downs makes it clear that neither was the Cornell administration ready or able to manage change.Once the violent takeover began, what little control President Perkins had was lost. The subsequent finger-pointing and resignations were unavoidable. Yet questions remain: Was it institutional racism fostered by a priest or political correctness that set off the furor? Who burned the cross in front of the African-American residence hall? Did the administration have a hand in the fraternity &quot;counterattack&quot; on Straight? Was this a spontaneous act out of frustration by African-American students or an SDS plot to radically reform Cornell? After it was over, did Cornell learn any lessons?I could not put it down. A must read for baby boomers, especially those intent on understanding events that formed the ideology of those in the White House today."},{"Title":"Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University","review":"Cornell campus events in April 1969 ran beyond the power of university administrators to manage them. The world witnessed the decline of docile, gentle student behavior, managed by old white men in tweed coats. Students found new, forceful ways to express themselves, and opened an era of campus struggles.Downs demonstrates that students know enough to know they don't want to learn some of the things that there teachers are teaching, yet they are also young and naive enough to stumble about agressively and sometimes irrationally for a solution. And the senior professors, save a few stalwarts, had no capacity to deal with this new breed of students.Based on Cornell's desire to &quot;do good&quot;, to promote social justice, to provide meaningful educational opportunities, and to add diversity (before there was such a common, abused term on American campuses), the Trustees approved a plan to enroll disenfranchised students from urban areas at their bucolic campus. Cornell was Ivy League, yes, but more rural than sophisticated, more agricultural than urbane. Cornell was to provide a strange environment for a noble experiment. Did it work? After the takeover of the administration building by armed students, most Americans never looked at university education the same way again.Meticulous archival research of previously unsurfaced or unpublished records brings life and details to a college's uncomfortable history."},{"Title":"Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University","review":"I was a junior at Cornell in April, 1969, and only after having read this book did I really understand what events happened that weekend. I'm not sure I understand even now what the significance of those events has been, but this book has put my own history in perspective for me, along with Cornell's."},{"Title":"Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University","review":"Donald Alexander Downs may very well feel uncomfortable with the conclusion that I've reached after reading Cornell \`69. He has convinced me, whether he likes it or not, that envy dominated the motives of the radical Afro-American student movement. Racial issues per se were of secondary importance. Many of the black students were unable to scholastically compete with their fellow white classmates. Everyone should turn to page 52 and read the following:\\"The Robertson report was less positive: \`we've been told by some [professors] that the optimistic academic reports given on the report so far are suspect for two reasons,' it stated. Some professors, \`for whatever reasons, have tended to mark black students easier than whites; and some blacks were allowed to stay in school longer than whites with similar records would be.'\\"Complaints of racism were simply a phony excuse to indulge in violent rhetoric and actions. These black students were placed in an awkward predicament by guilt tripped white administrators. Deep in their guts, they knew that their inflated grades were fraudulent. Inevitably, the students turned to radical politics to overcome their justified feelings of inferiority. Employing the race card conveniently allowed these below average students to feel morally superior to their white classmates.This particular sentence on page 280 also caught my attention:\\"Throughout the crisis, professors in the natural sciences were less upset at what happened than those in the liberal arts, perhaps because their teaching and research were less threatened in the politicized climate.\\"The hard science departments cynically wanted to stay out of harm's way. Live and let live became their unofficial motto. The soft sciences could essentially go to hades. This handshake with the devil has accelerated the decline of our universities. The leftists crazies have taken over many liberal arts classes---and few people give a darn. Why should it be therefore surprising that the works of underwhelming people like deconstructionists Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Paul DeMan often dominate the curriculum? Professor Downs has written a superb and though provoking work. It deals with events of some 37 years ago. Sadly, it's just as relevant in our current era.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness"},{"Title":"Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University","review":"The reason I came to Cornell was because not only was it prestigious, but also large enough to be truly diverse. It has always been political, but political in both directions. In the Straight, stacks of the ultra-liberal &quot;Progressive&quot; sit next to the reactionary &quot;Review&quot;. But what I think bears remembering is that we didn't lose anything by becoming &quot;politically correct&quot;. We are free to abhorr violence no matter what our political leaning, but to question the human worth of others is never acceptable."},{"Title":"PC Magazine Wireless Solutions","review":"The target reader seems to be a Win-XP user with a D-Link DI-624, who does not really want to learn much. If that is you, then this book may be fine for you. If you only want to run the wizards & menus & little else, great. I happen to use Win-XP on some machines, and have a D-Link DI-624 on one. But I actually was hoping to learn more, and this book disappointed me. I'm taking it back to Barnes & Noble.The authors use acronyms(initials) but usually make you go to the index to find out what the initials stand for. Seldom is there an explanation of what it really means. Sometimes the acronyms/initials are not defined, and at least once, the initials were defined two ways at two points in the book (see MAC as medium access control on page 90 and media access control on page 123 & the index).What I really disliked is the total omission of Linux, a bunch of the technologies & components involved in wireless, and a good explanation of the basics. This book omits way to much for me. The authors apparantly think readers do not need to understand wireless technology basics. I'm not looking for wireless network certification or employment, just good basic understanding and this book doesn't have it. It does have some good material for the newbie, and is not overly verbose, so 3 stars."},{"Title":"PC Magazine Wireless Solutions","review":"This 414 page guide is a great resource for readers who are ready to create their first wireless network, or extend their current wired network with wireless features.

The Author never talks over your head, but doesn't insult your intelligence either. The book is rich with photos, computer screen captures, and diagrams, and the Authors have made generous use of sidebars and notes.Chapter 8 Security Tips and Tricks had some enhancements that I was not already using (including a cool honeypot solution), and I thought that Chapter 14 Setting Up an Entertainment Network had a lot to offer.The book also has some chapters in its last part on wireless solutions for mobile, and office which build and expand on information in the previous chapters. However, these are a bit thin, and probably things most network admins already know.The real value in this book is its great guidance for building, extending and expanding a home network with wireless technologies. But, it is still appropriate for those of us who have a wireless network and are looking to enhance security, add new features, and troubleshoot problems.Recommended."},{"Title":"PC Magazine Wireless Solutions","review":"Great for WI-FI Newbie's ! & WI-FI Users alike !"},{"Title":"Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar","review":"This is Book 3 in the Alpha to Omega series of Jesse Jameson books. It's called the Curse of Caldazar, and I think it's truly stunning. Why?It has all the ingredience you'd expect in a good children's book: pace, adventure, magic, horror, and a heroine whose magical skills are truly awesome. There are some original ideas here that I haven't come across in children's fiction. And the descriptive passages are truly wonderful, clear and haunting.Jesse Jameson and the Curse of Caldazar is one of the best books I have read. This is a great book for kids and is a book I couldn't put down.
