The conversations are entertaining but the speakers talk so fast that I cannot understand them. As a beginner, I need to hear each word separately. When they run all the words together, I cannot tell where one word ends and the other begins. They also don't help you work on pronunciation. This is not a good program for beginners."},{"Title":"Spanish on the Go: A Level One Language Program (On the Go Series) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a collection of short dialogues reflecting various everyday situations.

Being a collection of dialogues, not a course as such, it can be used as a great supplement to any text-based or even an audio course, to enhance one's vocabulary and especially to train one's ear for comprehending spoken Spanish.It is a graded collection, and the level rises quite steeply, so one can't expect to absorb them all in one shot, but only as one's knowledge of grammar and vocabulary evolves.The voices on tapes are native Castialian Spanish, at least in the previous edition I own.

Each page is a meal in itself. Projects are broken down and explained in short bite size one- or two-page chunks. This is perfect for digesting each project's results and techniques and trying them out on your own. Tips include all the technical details you want, such as lighting instruments used, camera settings, lenses, distances from lights to subject to camera and more.As a director of photography for film and video projects over the last 15 years, I was inspired by the variety of styles and methods of working presented by the various photographers in this book. I'll take many of the lessons with me onto my next project.This book will impress you with it's elegant layout, design, instruction and last, but not least, striking images.Every photography instructional book should be as inspiring and usable as this masterpiece. A must have for every serious photographer and student of light."},{"Title":"Studio Lighting Solutions: Expert Professional Techniques for Artistic and Commercial Success (Pdnpros)","review":"Sort of a quandary here...if you're advanced enough in photography to be working with studio lighting, do you really need detailed, step-by-step instructions in lighting setups? It almost seems as if readers are expecting a beginners book that at the same time provides professional techniques.That said, I will admit that the specifics are a bit lacking here, so if you do need a lot of hand-holding, you're better off with a different book. However, the illustrations are excellent, and you can learn a great deal just from Neubart's photos. If you're open to exposure to interesting lighting techniques, this book will surely add some valuable ideas to your repertoire."},{"Title":"Studio Lighting Solutions: Expert Professional Techniques for Artistic and Commercial Success (Pdnpros)","review":"I'm an intermediate photographer and I bought this book looking to gain insight into studio lighting. I found that this book will appeal to commercial shooters and those looking to get their foot in the door. The work is amazing and I enjoyed the commentary provided by the professionals that took the shots. I never imagined the amount of thought and planning that goes into what appears to be a straight forward shot. Though it provides a few lighting diagrams, this is not a \\"how to\\" manual.

I had a friend looking to get a tattoo of a phoenix and I was keeping my eye out for images for him. This one caught my eye. But not being one to spend money on a book and not read it or at least try to read it, I gave it a go.This book is way outside my normal reading genres. First it is a spy novel, suspense thriller. Second it has a strong romantic element, yet with that being said, once into it I could not put it down.It is a fascinating story set in post WWII Japan under MacArthur's administration. It has great characters, a very complex plot and is extremely well written. It was both intriguing and heartwarming at the same time.

She writes to us of flight, of feminism and of famine, demonstrating her mastery of poetic techniques and her sense of justice. She dares to speak her mind, with beauty and strength.Rukeyser has influenced modern poets from Adrienne Rich to Sharon Olds. She reinforced the idea that science and art are inextricably linked, and helped set the stage for a healthier kind of feminism. By not downplaying women's traditional roles, while also seeking wholeheartedly what once was viewed as exclusively masculine -- the land of ideas -- Rukeyser remained true to her spirit."},{"Title":"The Book of Horses","review":"This book is a wonderful look into the past of horses, their progression into the modern world, the different breeds and riding styles, information on riding and care of the horse.

I would recommend this book for anyone, but especially for teenagers as it is easy to understand yet at the same time interesting, informative, and entertaining. Everyone from the amateur to experienced horseman can enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Five hundred dollar check (Berkeley series)","review":"This is a quaint, old book, well-written, but with the same style and archetypes as Alger's many other works. Still, it provides an interesting look into America before the turn of the 20th Century, and makes a good book to read by the fireplace."},{"Title":"Vita Sexualis: A Novel (Tuttle Classics)","review":"Ogai Mori was a deeply respected figure in Meiji-era Japan. Best remembered today as an author, playwright and poet, he also the Japanese Surgeon General and an expert on Military Hygiene. Secure in his position, respected and wealthy, in 1909 Mori took an unexpected turn and published \\"Vita Sexualis,\\" a controversial title that was banned three week after its publication.Perhaps the most shocking aspect of \\"Vita Sexualis\\" is is lack of sexuality. Ostensibly a record of burgeoning sexuality, written by a father to his son, so that his son would be better prepared for his own maturation, the main character is almost completely asexual, unable to understand the rampant behavior of his friends and contemporaries. He openly admits that he has never experienced the desires that seem to drive everyone around him. Women and men make themselves available to him, but he is defiant in his moral purity and never indulges.What is most shocking is also most interesting. Like Ihara Saikaku's \\"Life of an Amorous Man,\\" \\"Vita Sexualis\\" is a guided tour through Meiji-era sexuality, such as the famed Yoshiwara pleasure district. However unlike Saikaku's bohemian protagonist, Mori's man is strictly a spectator, inwardly mussing on why those around him take such joy in such base activities.\\"Vita Sexualis\\" is sexual philosophy. It is an intellectual take, something which Mori excelled at. It stands out in a field full of devil-may-care exploitative literature in the same vein, and shows that one can write a serious and intelligent sex book."},{"Title":"Vita Sexualis: A Novel (Tuttle Classics)","review":"I find it interesting that this work was banned--surprised not only because sex is not explicitly mentioned but because the overall theme of the novella is far from anti-establishment. Mori skillfully notes that while sex is pervasive in all facets of life, when viewed objectively the human obsession with sex is rather silly, making fools out of otherwise ordinary men.Mori's technical skill being noted, this is a remarkably dry read. Other reviewers praise Mori's \\"intellectual\\" take on sexuality, but it goes without saying that essentially all human emotions (lust, happiness, sadness, fear, etc.) could be analyzed as necessary but ultimately banal biological functions. By removing all emotion and passion from this work, Mori misses a chance to establish not only an intellectual but an emotional bond with the reader. I might even go further and say that by removing emotion from this work, Mori makes this study of sexuality more sophisticated while sacrificing completeness of the subject. Perhaps given the time during which it was written, Mori worked with what he thought he could get away with (and even still it was banned!). However, reading it in the early 21st century, Vita Sexualis falls short of expectations. If you're interested in this talented author, I'd start with Maihime (The Dancing Girl), Takasebune, or Gan (The Wild Geese) instead."},{"Title":"A Blue Tale and Other Stories","review":"This collection of three stories were the last of her fiction to be translated into English.

She points out that, though science can explain many things, it cannot tell society what is important or right. She challenges Christians to inform themselves about the issues and let their influence be felt. \\"The reason that these problems are not addressed effectively is a moral one,\\" says O'Leary. \\"Not enough people who have the power to do so care enough to alter their lifestyle or voting habits in order to deal with them.\\" Most of the book's 50 short chapters originally appeared as columns in Christian Week. However, O'Leary has as much to say to other thinking persons as to Christians. A strength of her book is her frequent reference to useful resources. These include Hannah's Prayer, a web-based resource for infertile couples; Jeremy Rifkin's book The Biotech Century; and Michael J. Behe's book Darwin's Black Box."},{"Title":"Who's Haunting the Eighth Grade (Junior High)","review":"I recently reread this while going through some of my old books. A group of eighth graders are going on a field trip to see a Shakespeare play in another town, but right from the start, everything seems to be going wrong. The teachers who are accompanying them on their trip are in a foul mood and spend a good part of the trip arguing with each other, which bothers the kids because they know that the teachers have recently become engaged to each other. Then, the bus breaks down in a small town before they can reach their destination. For a brief moment, things look like they're going to improve when the group decides to spend the night at a local bed and breakfast in a big, beautiful, old house. However, their spirits are almost immediately dampened again when they are told that the house is haunted and that anyone who tries to stay there is scared away by the ghost. Still, they proceed with their plan to stay there in order to avoid staying at the dumpy local motel. Needless to say, the ghost puts in an appearance, and strange things start to happen. Can the eighth graders catch the ghost, stop the hauntings, save the bed and breakfast from having to close, patch up the relationship between their feuding teachers, and still make it in time to see the play? Probably, but you'll have to read it to find out for sure.The book takes place in the 1980s, and the kids in the story are 14 years old. They mention the decade somewhere during the course of the story, and the descriptions of the clothes and some pop culture references make the time period fairly obvious. It also has some of the stock characters that books for pre-teens and early teens in the 80s have (ex. a boy-crazy space cadet, a level-headed health nut, a class clown, and a couple of young punks). Still, even though there are some things about the book that are a bit dated, it is still pretty enjoyable. The author has a sense of humor, and she plays with the characters' stereotypes a bit. The class clown is secretly quite sensitive and even a bit perceptive. There are also a couple of fun scenes when the girl who is only interested in boys is shocked to discover that the boys are more interested in the mystery than in her."},{"Title":"Options in Contemporary Christian Ethics","review":"Geisler has an easy-to-understand, but thought-provoking way of writing.

Almost 20 years old, the \\"establishment\\" has had to, kicking and screaming, be dragged to Dr. Gofman's clear analysis. I'd rather have a more recent book of a similar calibre, but, alas... Get your own copy; it's encyclopedic and worth the effort of mastering it. Well-written and clear, the author does not \\"skip steps\\".Nothing has changed. Very recent studies from Germany, for example, continue to show increased childhood leukemia and other cancers around nuclear reactors; unnecessary suffering (surplus pain and death) since this is already known. Bottom line; we must get rid of nukes. No compromise with this makes any sense!This is for INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SCREWED OUT OF A DECENT EDUCATION, BUT WANT A DECENT LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, THEIR KIDS AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL. If you have a 10th -12th grade education, start with a library book on radiation/nuclear issues from the juvenile section; no shame there.This is work; working for a better world requires an informed, thoughtful and pro-active citizenry.Also Highly recommended: \\"Lifes Delicate Balance: Causes and Prevention of Breast Cancer,\\" by Dr. Janette Sherman; a sophisticated and wholistic analysis.\\"The Code Killers\\" by Ace Hoffman, a lucid explanation of nuclear power based upon superb graphics.

But author Kayla Perrin took me in a totally different direction with this brilliantly written novel of murder, suspense and betrayal. Sylvia Grayson is the matriarch of an affluent African-American family in New Orleans. Her family heritage includes being the daughter of one of the original founders of Delta Gamma Psi sorority. The women of this family carry down the traditions of attending Dillard University and pledging Delta.Being of an elite heritage, Sylvia marries a jazz musician, whom is considered beneath her by her family standards. From the union, a daughter named Olivia is conceived. It is expected of her to follow in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother and attend Dillard and pledge Delta.During the summer of 1975, when a stranger moves to town and a young girl is murdered, the nature of Sylvia and Olivia's relationship is changed forever. An incident from Sylvia's past comes back to haunt her. She believes that the young man she has hired to do some work around the estate knows what she would prefer to keep hidden. She pays the young man to leave town. This totally devastates Olivia, who has developed a relationship with him.Olivia grows up to be the author of horror stories. She is an embarrassment to her mother because of her drinking and the erotic nature of her fiction. Although a Delta member, Sylvia barely acknowledges her presence and overlooks her for committees. Olivia realizes her mother still considers her a disappointment. She fails to recognize the relationship with Rachelle is failing miserably. Rachelle develops a rebellious streak after her best friend; Alette tells her she overheard Olivia admitting she deceitfully altered the path of Rachelle's future. Rachelle goes against her upbringing, even contemplating not following the tradition of becoming a Delta.A person from Olivia's past reenters her life around the same time Sylvia is receiving threats and accusations concerning the murder of a young girl in 1975. Through a series of events, secrets are revealed that hurt and change the way Olivia sees her mother. It all culminates with dead bodies, explosive revelations of \\"who done it\\" and eventually, restored relationships.Kayla Perrin did an outstanding job keeping me guessing and flipping pages. I thought the drama would never end. Just when you think you have it figured out, there's another plot twist. This is a really good read.Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"Easy and interesting book to read as I read in an evening setting as my interest had questions I wanted answered. Since I was not a part of a sorority setting I wanted to know what was so special about these groups but that was not really the storyline as much as it was about a family bonding together before they seek to go out and help the world that may seem to be less fortunate."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"New Orleans is considered The Delta. This is a book about murder, suspense and betrayal. Lies come back to hunt mother Sylvia Grayson. Sylvia Grayson is the matriarch of an affluent family. The tradition for the women in the family is to attend Dillard University and pledge Delta sorority. Sylvia's daughter Olivia falls in love with a stranger to the dismay of Sylvia. This stranger is suspected of murdering a girl in New Orleans, and Sylvia suspects he knows secrets about her she would rather keep hidden. She pays him to leave town, upsetting Olivia. Olivia grows up still hurt about losing a man she loved and with a daughter of her own. Olivia is doing the same thing to her own daughter Rachelle that her mother has done to her.This family is very dysfunctional. Olivia was so set against Rochelle attending any other colleges; she threw out Rachel's acceptance letters. Rachelle so wanting her own identity she considers going against family tradition to rebel against her mother. When all is said and done, secrets are revealed in an explosive ending.This book was slow, slow, slow. Chapter 55-56 were the most exciting parts of the book. I was about to put it down when I got to that point. I really felt the story did not need to be dragged out so much. I just did not like this book by the time I finished it. Glad I borrowed this from the library."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"This book was alright with me. Usually I have a problem with the characters when it comes to this author but not with this book. This book was an example of how secrets can really kill the soul. How secrets can affect three or more generations of a family. The only big problem I had was that the author act like you can't find good friends outside of a sorority. Not everyone who joins a sorority is about sisterhood and volunteering. This author loves happy ending and if that her writing style I guess I will have to deal with it if I am going to keep reading her books."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"I thought I had it figured out, but Perrin got me with the ending. Pretty good read about not-so-perfect mother-daughter relationships. Sylvia, the snobby meddling mother, Olivia the love-struck daughter turned alcoholic, and Rachelle, the daughter/granddaughter who wants her independence but craves her mother's love. What is the secret that Sylvia Grayson has hidden all of these years and how will the revelation affect those she loves? Some of the story is rather easy to figure out with the clues Perrin throws in, but I definitely didn't see the ending coming. Perrin has created a story that, while not a page turner, is worth a read. 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"this was a nice read. i was touched by the fact that this was a love story tied into suspense, murder, and drama. this book takes you into the lives of a family reviewing their past mistakes and how it affects their future and their present. i enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"I chose this book because I thought it would be about being in a soroity and sisters helping one another.

This multi-generational novel allows us to see the effects of generational curses and also the effect on mother daughter relationships."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"Kayla Perrin's latest release, The Delta Sisters, is a multi-generational saga that chronicles the impact of a mother's past sins on her daughter's. The story opens with a murder of a local promiscuous teenaged girl but quickly shifts focus to widow Sylvia Grayson, a prim and proper New Orleans socialite who wants only the best for her daughter, Olivia. Olivia must mingle and date within a select group of privileged children, so when Olivia falls in love with &quot;the help&quot; Sylvia outwardly disapproves, separates the two lovers (in a predictable mean-spirited way) and cripples an already fragile mother/daughter relationship.Fast forward nearly thirty years later and we discover a widowed, alcoholic Olivia in an equally dysfunctional relationship with her daughter, Rachelle, from a passionless marriage to a man thirty-years her senior. Rachelle suffers an identity crisis -- wanting to desperately escape the oppressive household and break family tradition by neither attending the local Dillard University nor pledging the Delta sorority that her great-grandmother helped found and where her grandmother and mother are idolized.The book opened strong with a murder and some hint of Sylvia's secret past, but fizzled when it went off into unrelated tangents and drawn out passages of mother/daughter banter, lost love themes, and occasional hints that a murderer is still afoot. Nearly 300 pages later, the police reopens the murder case, lost loves are reunited, and Olivia's secrets are revealed -- but at that point, I was ready for the book to end. I struggled through the shifting focus, slow pacing, and elongated storyline. In the end, I was disappointed and closed the book thinking &quot;was that it?!?!&quot; While reading, it was also a challenge to understand how and when the title of the book would become relevant to the plot. I suppose the analogy of the lead characters being sorority sisters and a sorority being like a family (even the dysfunctional ones) is a takeaway, but I still feel somewhat misled by the title because sorority politics and sisterhood principles were addressed so late in the story and played such a small role in the overall plot.Overall, this book was entertaining for a light summer read -- the characters had good intentions and were fairly likable. There was romance, drama, and a bit of intrigue; so the elements are there for an enjoyable reading experience.PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"In 1953 Lafayette, Louisiana, Sylvia tries to flee from what she did. The incident haunts her for the rest of her life as she suffers nightmares vividly displaying this calamity.Still life goes on. Over the next two decades Sylvia insures her own daughter follows a path to success by keeping a rein on Olivia. However, in 1975 New Orleans someone killed Liza ?bad girl? Monroe, which shook up Sylvia more than it should have. She reacts by tightening her control of her daughter until Olivia has had enough and revolts.Two decades later, Olivia?s daughter Rachelle attends college. However, unbeknownst to the coed, her mother, or her grandmother someone waits. That individual has killed before and will murder anyone who might reveal secrets. Age is no factor to this predator willing to send Sylvia, Olivia, but especially Rachelle to the morgue.This exciting story line freshens up what could have been the trite watcher-killer theme by furbishing characters that seem so genuine so that when something happens, fans empathize with the women as the episode feels real too. The three females make the tale as the audience compares each with one another while also what lurks in the shadows. Kayla Perrin paints a terse psychological suspense thriller that hooks the audience from the moment Sylvia tries to run away from herself until the final confrontation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"I have been a Kayla Perrin fan since her days with Arabesque and loved it when she crossed over to mainstream fiction. This book is, for the most part, an engrossing read. The only flaw that kept it from being a 5-star read was the relationship between Harvey and Olivia. In my opinion the two never really had a relationship, but then he returns and they're still madly in love with each other. When did they really fall in love???? Other than that plot faux pas, the book was a quick and intriguing read. The suspense was well-paced and the climax completely unexpected.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Delta Sisters","review":"The Grayson family is one of the most prominent and upstanding African American families in New Orleans. Family matriarch, Sylvia Grayson will do whatever it takes to ensure her family keeps up appearances. As a result, she is overprotective of her only daughter Olivia and typically wants to control her life. Sylvia wants Olivia to attend Dillard University, become a member of Delta Gamma Psi Sorority, and marry the right man; just as she did. But Sylvia's life is littered with lies, deceit and shady manipulations and her greatest fear is that one day all of her sordid actions will come to light and her pretentious world will be shattered.Olivia Grayson has always felt smothered under her mother's watchful eye. She is coming into womanhood, and as most teenagers do, she wants more freedom to choose whom she dates and the choice to have fun as she pleases. It seems her only outlet is writing and her best friend Belinda. Olivia is trying desperately to adjust to her mundane life when in the summer of 1975 her life is forever changed. Someone murders the town's most promiscuous female, her mother begins acting strangely and Olivia meets the man of her dreams. Then something tragic happens and Olivia becomes a mere shell of the vibrant young woman she used to be.Years later a widowed Olivia does not know how to love her daughter Rachelle. Rachelle has been the perfect daughter, making good grades and not causing any trouble. While Rachelle has always felt the love of her grandmother Sylvia, she still yearns for her mother's approval. Rachelle tires of her mother's indifference and decides to live her life for herself. However, her act of rebellion could place her in danger as there is still a murderer on the loose.In Kayla Perrin's latest novel THE DELTA SISTERS, she weaves an engrossing tale of murder, lies, and deceit. Readers learn that people aren't always who they seem to be and that the sins of the mother, can often become the sins of the daughter.Reviewed by Simone A.

Instead, he drinks a cloned, dried blood mixed with heated water. Abbot, on the other hand, is a Tourist. He feels justified in not only drinking blood from humans, but also in their domination. To Abbot, humans are just like cattle - or orl. If Abbot succeeds in sending his message to Luren, humanity will be doomed.Abbot and Titus, as vampires have incredible telepathic powers. They are able to bend others to their will and create believable illusions. Using these skills, Abbot does everything he can to try contact Luren.

Astronomer Dr. Titus Shiddehara leads the moon investigation, in which many believe that they can contact the home planet. However, alien life form has existed on planet earth for centuries as the Luren, better known as vampires, reside among the humans. The Luren are split between the Residents who believe that humans are equals, deserving respect and dignity, and the Tourists who feel the species should be hunted as food and game. Both Luren factions deem the moon crash were members of their race.Titus, a Resident, wants to insure no contact occurs with the native planet of the crashed victims for fear of what an arrival will do to the humans. The Tourists want to invite their \\"relatives\\" to a gala feast. On the project Titus meets the human he loved, Inea Cellura when he was Darrell Raaj. He explains to her that Darrell died in the car crash, but due to his vampiric sire, Darrell was reborn as Titus. Also on the moon side is Abbott the Tourist who sired Titus. The question remains who to trust in what could prove to be a pivotal moment for the sentient beings of planet earth.THOSE OF MY BLOOD is an exhilarating tale that focuses on two competing parties (not the democrats and the republicans) struggling for supremacy since outlawing human kill in 1850. The story line and the cast provide a plausible supposition that vampires live among us. The moon crash accelerates the conflict giving the strong story line a critical moment (pivotal point) that will impact the future. Fans of supernatural science fiction will immensely treasure Jacqueline Lichtenberg's fabulous tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Those of My Blood","review":"Long out of print, Those of My Blood is soon to be re-released.Titus Shiddehara once died before the eyes of the woman he loved.

Yet how can he lie to this woman who is open, direct, and courageous?To complicate matters, how can he hide his relation to an alien spacecraft crashed on the moon?The book deals with how to handle an intimate relationship without resorting to manipulation or falsehood. It's a can't-put-down read. If you don't get some ideas on how to carry on your own intimate relationships from Those of My Blood, I'll be very surprised. The best novels relate to our own challenges. Those of My Blood does so in a riveting and thoughtful way."},{"Title":"Those of My Blood","review":"I first read this book at least ten years ago, and I've read it a number of times since then and enjoyed it every time. This is not a steamy, more sex and violence than story vampire romance. It's science fiction, with well-thought out aliens who happen to be similar to fantasy vampires, and a very nicely done love story. I can definitely see how it might not be Anita Blake fans' cup of tea, but, honestly, comparing this to that is like comparing Anne McCaffrey to Sandra Brown -- so mismatched that any conclusions are meaningless. If you like science fiction, and enjoy a compelling love story, adventure, vampires (the author very neatly weaves vampires and aliens together with all the best parts of vampire tradition included), and characters who have more pressing concerns than falling into bed together, try this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Those of My Blood","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I REALLY enjoyed it. Lichtenberg always provides a good read.Vampires on the moon was, I thought, a different kind of premise, and that they were science fiction based, rather than occult or supernatural, I enjoyed.I liked the relationship and interplay between Titus, the main character, and Abbott, his vampire \\"father.\\" It had an intimate aspect of people who care about each other, but they were also adversaries in conflict, and I thought that Lichtenberg brought this through well.One thing that I would like to have seen more of was the background of Earth's Luren, and their biological processes. The earth vampires are actually hybrids between humans and alien vampires who landed on earth 300 years ago. Titus's genetic father wasn't his mother's husband, but it wasn't Abbott, either. What happened? Where is Titus' genetic father? Does Titus know anything about him at all? Did I miss something? Am I getting it wrong?When a luren awakens after being killed or dieing, but in reality just coming out of a very deep hibernation, and is taken out of their grave, are they the exact age that they were when they died? Or, if they are old when they die, are they young when they are resurrected? How does this work?Titus mentions that he has more human ancestors than Abbott; Titus is more fully human. Why? Can't the human-luren hybrids breed with each other? Can they only breed with humans? I would have thought that in the first few generations the hybrid vampires would crossbreed with humans because the hybrids were very rare, but then I would think that they would mate with one another to try to preserve the luren characteristics. And, given the Tourists attitudes towards humans, I would think that they wouldn't want to breed with a human if they had any choice at all. Maybe the female hybrids are sterile, and the male hybrids have to crossbreed with humans?At some point, I wanted to see Connie, Titus's supplier and the mastermind for the Residents. She seemed like such an interesting character from what Titus thinks about her. But she is totally offstage through everything.I have been told that writers should hit the ground running, and not do too much flashback, let the backstory fill in by what the characters are doing now. Lichtenberg does this, and it makes for a suspenseful novel, but I just wanted a few more pages about the earth luren, themselves, just a little bit of history.I have ordered Lichtenberg's novel \\"Dreamspy,\\" so maybe that will answer my questions.In some ways, this book reminded me of Fevre Dream, by George R. R. Martin. Both books have a very different take on vampires.I recommend \\"Those of My Blood,\\" and anything else by Lichtenberg."},{"Title":"Those of My Blood","review":"I am so happy to find that this classic has been reprinted.

I have shared my enthusiasm for this series with other C.S. Lewis fans. I will return to this study again for refreshment and referral.Dr. Markos emulates Lewis in his simple (mere) explanation of quite profound concepts, with humor and clear examples.His enthusiasm for his subject was infectious."},{"Title":"The Life and Writings of C.S. Lewis","review":"Prof. Markos has done the nearly impossible feat of summarizing the life and writings of C.S. Lewis in twelve 30 to 40 minute lectures. His delivery is rapid and engaging. Some have complained that when he really gets wound up, they feel like he is shouting. I've had no problem with that (but I don't listen with ear-buds). Markos makes no secret about loving Lewis' works and confesses that he has been one of the most profound influences in his own literary life. Considering the alternative, I vastly prefer listening to people who love the subject they are lecturing about to those that do not. He does not engage in the sick-sad-world of \\"disinterested literary criticism\\" that so many professors use to turn the spotlight away from their subjects... and on to their own big brains. Are their weaknesses? A few, but they are minor. After the fashion of Winston Churchill (who butchered German with monotonous regularity), Markos mispronounces the German word \\"sehnsucht.\\" (Saying it \\"SIGN\\"-sookt, instead of the proper \\"SANE-sookt.\\") But who knows, perhaps Lewis mispronounced the word too. He was, after all, a contemporary of Churchill and the bombing of London was happening when Lewis did some of his most famous works. In my view, Markos' style never gets in the way. He is brilliant. He loves Lewis' mind and ideas. The lectures are outstanding. I have listened to this remarkable set of lectures five or six times. Each time I've come away with something new. If I could give this set six stars, I would."},{"Title":"The Life and Writings of C.S. Lewis","review":"Lewis lived from 1898 to 1963. He completed an extended metamorphosis from confirmed atheist to theist to Christian in 1933, and then plunged into writing and lecturing, subtly as well as overtly, to push for a u-turn back to old-time, literal Christianity. Lewis, in fact, found a lot to like in the medieval mindset. He wrote in numnerous genres as well as apologetics. Some writers have credited him for leading them toward, or more seriously into, Christianity.Professor Marcos's lectures concentrate heavily on explaining and summarizing (sometimnes in substantial detail) Lewis's writings, rather than providing much biographical background information. Marcos's presentation has the sense of a very animated sermon. I get a strong impression he reveres Lewis."},{"Title":"The Life and Writings of C.S. Lewis","review":"The author's knowledge and passion for his subject are very strong. He clearly articulates his points, including some that are moderately abstract. The course flows in a logical sequence. The author summarizes a huge amount of material effectively.However, the author's personal views regarding liberals, modernists and academics intrude too often and too sharply. His passion extends to name calling of those who don't see the world as he sees it (or the way that CS Lewis) sees it. This undercuts the author's direct and common sense style which rightfully shows some of the real shortcomings of these groups regarding religion, philosphy, politics and culture.This course serves as a good introduction to modern Christian apologetics. Those interested in CS Lewis would be better served reading a different biography or reading Mere Christianity."},{"Title":"The Life and Writings of C.S.

However, of my three favorite authors at the time, Twain, Traven, and McMurtry (early Mcmurtry was pretty darn good), I had read just about all there was. Where to turn to next? While pondering that question in 1989, I overheard on the news that Camilo Jose Cela had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. From that time on I have been an avid reader of most Nobel-Prize winning novelists and it all started with Cela. I remember all of my Spanish Lit professors had \\"La Familia de Pascual Duarte\\" on their shelves along with Cervantes and the usual suspects. I read that book and wanted more. However, Cela can be challenging.When I got a copy of \\"San Camilo, 1936\\" I was shocked to find that sentences were pages long and all the normal-lengthed chapters were one extended paragraph. Not the book to pick up with just a few minutes to spare. Reading Saramago helped cure me of the fear on endless sentences and paragraphs so I took \\"San Camilo, 1936\\" on a cruise recently. I read it and I'm glad I did. It was hard to stop in the middle of a page but I had plenty of lengthy times for reading. The book struck me as the caffein-induced thoughts of a young man. In the first chapter, his thoughts focussed on the local houses of ill-repute. In the second chapter, the focus was on the deaths of several women and one in particular. By the third chapter, I was starting to see a true focus developing. I came to appreciate \\"San Camilo, 1936\\" as a unique literary form where history and perspective emerges in the thoughts of this young man. All sex at first but then disturbing events begin to consume more of his thoughts. As the Nationaist rebellion begins, we understand how the Spanish mind began to absorb the increasing events in their lives. Our narrator shows through his thoughts how the rebellion gradually comes to the forefront of his focus. We see the characters, who were once just fellow citizens, break into factions and how the cause becomes greater than love and respect. It really worked well and I presume that this was what Cela wanted the reader to understand.The closing chapter is a brief one (but still one long paragraph) in which the author analyzes the Spanish mind and concludes with a plea for love. Cela is a bit more earthly with his concept of love but, then, he's been that way throughout the book. I found myself underlining a number of passages where, amidst the repetion, brilliant observations would emerge.I'm glad I've finally read \\"San Camilo, 1936\\". I'd read the brief dedication dozens of times over the years. If it's not against the rules, it's worth sharing;\\"To the conscripts of 1937, all of whom lost something; their life, their freedom, their dreams, their hope, their decency. And not to the adventurers from abroad , Fascists and Marxists, who had their fill of killing Spaniards like rabbits and whom no one had invited to take part in our funeral.\\"After reading and re-reading that dedication, I knew that this had to be a brilliant novel. I'm glad that I finally found the time to discover that it truly is."},{"Title":"Una Imagen en el Espejo","review":"La historia de unas gemelas con diferentes personalidades, una muy indepeniente y extrovertida, la otra seria y muy apegada a su padre.Una de las gemelas es obligada a casarse con un hombre al que no ama, pero la otra gemela usurpara el lugar ella."},{"Title":"Una Imagen en el Espejo","review":"Aunque la historia es buena no se puede comparar con los otros que ella a escrito y en realidad no es mala solo que no es lo que me esperaba de un libro de ella, es una historia muy tipica de la gemela mala y la otra buena, aunque el final me parecio inesperado pero bueno no fue una total perdida de tiempo."},{"Title":"Public Radio: Behind the Voices","review":"This book of profiles is well written and very engrossing.

His maps, both current and historical, are well-crafted. The book's best feature, however, is its multitude of stunning photographs that bring to life this enormous, majestic realm of water, wilderness, and vibrant inhabitants both human and animal. Ondaatje must be an even better photographer than he is a writer, and is obviously in tune with the people he meets.

The depictions of rivers, mountains, and savannahs are simply breathtaking."},{"Title":"Journey to the Source of the Nile","review":"This book is one of the best books I have got in touch recently on the great expedition in search of the birth of one of the greatest river in the world.

The book helps the reader not only to gather knowledge of the great river but also the diverse culture of the African sub continent.Recommend this book if you are truly eco traveler and nature lover."},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the civil war)","review":"\\"The Outbreak of Rebellion\\" is John Nicolay's story of the early days of the Civil War. Written just twenty years after the events it records, it begins with the rumblings of secession in South Carolina and continues through the first Battle of Bull Run/Manassas. It gives, while not a contemporary account, one based on living memory. On these pages the reader gets an up close view of Abraham Lincoln and is taken back to the days of secession, Fort Sumter, the mob attack on the Sixth Massachusetts in Baltimore, the death of Elmer Ellsworth, issues that made their way from Missouri and Kentucky to the White House and the demonstration of pro-Union sentiment in West Virginia only to name a few. Written by President Lincoln's private secretary, it has a strong Union flavor.Although short, this is a good history. It has sufficient facts to qualify as history, but it is also a period piece, bringing the spirit of the times to the reader. One example of the partisan prose with which this book is filled is Nicolay's assessment of President Buchanan: \\"his condition of mind predisposed him in a remarkable degree to fall under the controlling influence of his disloyal counselors. He possessed the opposing qualities of feeble will and stubborn prejudice; advancing years and decreasing vigor added to his irresolution embarrassed his always limited capabilities.\\" It is better written than many Civil War memoirs. Read it for its spirit, the spirit of a Union triumphant and take the history is a bonus."},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the civil war)","review":"This history of the outbreak of the Civil War is unique in presenting it from the perspective of Lincoln's personal secretary. The man was a participant, and on the legal aspects gives some very clear headed arguments. Much of the precedent goes back to the aftermath of the American Revolution. There were two steps to creating the federal government of the United States. First, each colony had to declare independence from England (which they did together in one document). The individual colonies could now agree to enter into a larger confederation of colonies. It was not at all clear that this would happen, as many had different interests. For that reason the constitution does not outlaw slavery, and fails to address whether member of the union can later secede. These and other touchy issuies might have been deal breakers.The Southern Secession required a similar process, which raised some paradoxes. Nicolay argues that, constitutional ambiguity aside, none had the authority to issue articles of secession. Simply put, it is not among the defined powers of the governors or legislatures. Their oath of office requires them to support and defend the constitution of the United States. But secede they did, after which -- as independent states -- they were free to enter into a new confederacy. Here is where Nicolay finds contradiction in their arguments. They seceeded over the issue of states' rights. But having done so, promptly surrendered them to a new confederacy. Nicolay says, probably due need for immediate action, the confederate constitution was largely taken from the original. Among key changes, the statement that all men are created equal was striken. But there was also no provision allowing a state to secede from the new union. Essentially, Nicolay argues the states' rights issues was merely a pretext.He points to a single man as setting events in motion -- Governor Cist of South Carolina. He wrote a letter to other governors asking, if South Carolina should secede, would the others follow? The answers were ambiguous, but things were set in motion.Nicolay argues that the slavery issue was only vital to a very few states, and even there only to influentual land owners of the deep south. For the ordinary person there was little or nothing to be gained:\\"Drills, parades, meetings, bonfires, secession harangues, secession cockades, palmetto flags, purchase of fire-arms and powder, singing of the Marseillaise -- there is not room to enumerate the follies to which the general populace, especially of Charleston, devoted their days and nights. There was universal satisfaction: to the conspirators, because their schemes were progressing; to the rabble, because it had a continuous holiday.\\"Of all the states, only Texas submitted the articles of succesion to the people for a vote. Texas was a special case because it had only been in the Union about twenty years. Sam Houston was disappointed because he expected the Federal army to help police the Mexican border, but they did not. Houston's scheme was to secede but not join the Confederacy. He believed Texas could conquer northern Mexico, gain access to the Pacific, and be positioned to suceed as an independent nation. The legislature threw him out and went with the Confederacy.The battle of Bull Run is especially well covered, and turns out quite unlike the simplified accounts. A good survey of the struggles in the border states is also given.* * *This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evning there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

The Outbreak of Rebellion.From here you can follow either East or West Theatre first:IIA - Eastern Theatre(3) The Peninsula - after the failure of Bull Run, and attempt is made to capture Richmond by a naval landing.(4) The Army under Pope; while Union troops are evacuating from the failed peninsula effort, Lee turns on Pope and inflicts another defeat at 2nd Bull Run. Lee then attempts to cross the Potomac and invade the north.(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg; McClellen having returned from the peninsula stops Lee's invasion at Antietam but fails to destroy his army. Burnside takes over and pursues Lee to Fredericksburg, where the Union army self-destructs in an assault on its fortified heights.(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Hooker replaces Burnside and tries to take the Union army around Fredericksburg, but is bluffed from the dense forests around Chancellorsville. Lee again breaks free and this time invades Pennsylvania but is stopped at Gettysburg.(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864; this valley is a thorn in the Union's flank, and is ultimately razed so Union forces can operate more freely in the east.(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65; Lincoln is desperate to end the war. Grant promises to do so at a price. It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north. Grant wrests the initiative, and with the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. After Grant's decisive victory at Shiloh, the Union never loses the initiative in the west.(8) The Mississippi; the struggle for Vicksburg, which puts the entire Mississippi in Union hands.(7) The Army of the Cumberland; the struggle for Chattanooga; Union defeat at Chickamauga, besieged at Chattanooga, final breakout of the siege.(9) Atlanta; Union drive down the critical rail line through hard country from Chattanooga to Atlanta.(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville; after Atlanta, Sherman's famed march to the sea, after which he very nearly links up with Grant driving down on Petersburg.CAUTION:This series is public domain. Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work.The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such. This is merely a reader who has derived great personal pleasure from this series.

They won't recognize the name Edward Stratemeyer right off the bat, though. He began as a writer in his own right and gradually became the driving force behind the publication of a myriad of mystery series aimed at teenagers in the early 1900s. Among his most popular character-creations were the Rover Boys, Tom Swift, the Bobbsey Twins, the Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. While he outlined the plots, a variety of individuals in his \\"Stratemeyer Snydicate\\" actually penned the texts.Not much is known about Stratemeyer's personal life, so a large portion of this volume is spent in focus on the series books themselves. Lange includes quotes from some of the \\"real\\" authors who had initially agreed to Stratemeyer's silent ghostwriter rule. She also summarizes research about the series' popularity over the years and how they were the right publications for the right audience at the right time. For example, the fictional depiction of independent young females like Nancy Drew gave credence to the real-life feminism of the day.Diehard fans of all ages may find it disconcerting to learn that no Carolyn Keene or Franklin W. Dixon exist. While that knowledge might take away some of the magic and appeal of the titles, it also serves as proof of the success of such a publishing endeavor. Equally disturbing may be the fact that our heroes are all pretty old: Frank and Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew first showed up in print in the 1930s, and the Bobbsey Twins appeared in 1904! And yet they endure and remain among the classics of children's literature."},{"Title":"Edward Stratemeyer: Creator of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (Who Wrote That?)","review":"Let me first compliment Brenda Lange and Kyle Zimmer on their attempts to disseminate information regarding this prolific, yet virtually unknown, creator and writer of the some of the world's best known juvenile book series. I encourage its inclusion in any reader's collection on the history of juvenile literature and give this aspect of the book, four stars.However, it is a shame that these authors did not consult Edward Stratemeyer's family or more fully use the considerable knowledge of Syndicate researcher, James Keeline, for their book's research. For this reason, I had to exclude one star from my review. Stratemeyer Syndicate ghost writer Leslie McFarlane's biography and many previously published Syndicate history offerings were a poor resource as they contain many inaccuracies in their data and their personal depictions of Edward Stratemeyer. McFarlane never met Edward personally or even spoke to him on the phone. I am somewhat dismayed at this published repetition of this aspect of such inadequately researched Syndicate material.Clearly, the full and completely accurate story of Edward Stratemeyer will still have to wait for the comprehensive book my sister and I are writing about the personal history of our great-grandfather, and James Keeline's study of this incredible man and his writing syndicate."},{"Title":"Happy Days and Wonder Years: The Fifties and the Sixties in Contemporary Cultural Politics","review":"This is a fascinating account of the use of popular culture in constructing nostalgia and with it collectively shared political-cultural narratives of the nation's history. It is particularly apropos during an election centered, to a strange degree, on events 30 to 40 years ago.The book focuses on two iconic public figures, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who each successfully constructed alternative interpretations of the 1950s and 1960s and rode them to the White House. In some sense Reagan's was the simpler task, using his personal charisma to frame a nostalgia evoking American dominance and stability, \\"a chronology of 1950s normality, 1960s deviance and trauma, 1970s hangover and stagnation, and a 1980s return to health and glory,\\" aimed at a largely white and male core political constituency for whom such a narrative did not do tremendous violence to their personal interests.Clinton's task was harder-as Marcus observes, \\"American imaginations find it difficult to hold onto the image of an antimilitaristic, psychedelicized, left-wing white southerner.\\" But Clinton managed to turn the trick, reaching back to JFK and Elvis as his touchstones. Indeed, Marcus argues that the death of George Bush's southern guitar-picking political advisor Lee Atwater deprived him of the one political hand who might have had the cultural instincts to fashion a successful counter to Elvis as Policy Wonk, and with an assist from Ross Perot, Clinton went on to win in 1992.Reading this well-written book one wonders what Marcus would have made of the media's hagiographic treatment of Reagan at the time of his death, or the weirdly backward looking focus of the current presidential election campaign. But it is precisely that backward gaze which demonstrates the contemporary relevance of this book."},{"Title":"Artistas","review":"Here's the thing -- Breeden has captured a truly unique time and place: he does a remarkable job of bringing to life the Texas border, its vast space, its tension between these newcomers and the locals. Really, really strong dialogue. My favorite character is Ray, the angry, hostile, border-patrolman, trapped in this excellent drama of gunplay and misguided passions. An excellent read -- fast-paced, tense, highly-original, a real page-turner. Do yourself a favor: grab this one quick."},{"Title":"Artistas","review":"In Artistas, Breeden brings us inside the aftermath of war through a rich and very entertaining story of a group of battle-scarred veterans coping with their wartime experiences. He creates a set of very compelling characters involved in a simple effort to gain some inner peace (and maybe have some fun). His imagery is powerful and the depth and range of the story's characters will leave you thinking about the books for weeks. Read it, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Artistas","review":"Here's a book we've all read before: old war vets get together and reminisce about the horrors they saw; they get drunk; they seek solace in the arms of women.Here's a book you haven't read before: these guys convene in a worthless Texas desert town on the Mexican border and try to screw Uncle Sam out of some G.I. Bill money by starting an art school in a bar. And the funny part is, some of them are serious about art!Breeden takes a familiar idea and puts his own sardonic twist on it. Like the disillusioned teen in his book Another Number, or like the goatee-stroking poet that he is in real life, the characters in Artistas approach life with a poetic cynicism that somehow comes across as nostalgic and hopeful. If Dorothy Parker were a grisly old WWII vet in the south Texas desert...Watch out for the hateful, domineering landlord who owns the town, though, or the reluctantly violent sheriff in his pocket. And then there's Eddie, the youngest and most volatile of the vets, who mouths the words as he reads comic books and practices twirling his pistol out behind the bar, practicing for a gunfight.The unifying metaphor in the book is a painting, a new spin on the Lord's Supper that seems at first tongue-in-cheek, even sacrilegious. But when you get to know these characters and their struggle with their post-war world, you'll see a different meaning in the painting, and you will come away as they do: no better off but, thank God (or Art), hopeful at last."},{"Title":"Outlaws: A Quest for Butch and Sundance","review":"While the historical content is acceptable, the author makes some blatant mistakes mostly in the photos. In one photo he shows the site of the Wilcox train robbery near a present day railroad sign dispaying the \\"Wilcox\\" whistle stop. However, the actual train robbery happened about 12 miles northeast of this location. The train tracks were moved 2 years after the train robbery and the actual site is along a raised abandoned railroad grade. Another errors is the photo of the jail cell where Butch was held in the Wyoming Territorial Prison (now a state park). While the building walls are original, almost nothing inside is. The whole place was gutted at one time and used as a barn. A reconstruction of the prison was done, so the \\"prison cell\\" shown is not the actual cell, but a reconstructed one."},{"Title":"Outlaws: A Quest for Butch and Sundance","review":"This book is less about Butch and Sundance and more about the travels of the Irish author.

Your command of colloquial Spanish will break down barriers that mere conversational proficiency cannot overcome , and this book has proven to be an excellent teacher for me."},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"I echo the compliments of the other reviewers.

What a find! Every time I pick it up I learn something new, some subtle detail about a verb, a more accurate translation for a phrase, a nuance that I need to be aware of.

I'm actually on my second copy having worn one out.&iexcl;C&oacute;mpralo ahora mismo!"},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this little gem. It's an outstanding reference book. The author's mastery of Spanish is rather humbling, but he is able to convey a great deal of knowledge using a writing style that is both relaxed and very enjoyable to read.This book is a sort of Spanish-to-English dictionary, but it doesn't simply list English equivalents of a Spanish word the way a regular bilingual dictionary does. It goes into a discussion of the word in question and explains the little nuances and shades in meaning in a way that most dictionaries never come close to doing. The definitions given include examples and anecdotes that put the words in context to help the reader better grasp their meaning. When necessary, the author is always careful to point out the various meanings a particular word might have in different parts of the Spanish-speaking world. Further, the author is not afraid to list &quot;off-color&quot; or vulgar words in an attempt to save the reader from unwittingly making a fool of him or herself by using the wrong word in the wrong part of the world.My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that this book isn't even longer and more exhaustive than it is (it's 303 pages), although the book's relative brevity makes it easier to completely read and digest. Still, a second volume that picks up where this one leaves off would be wonderful to have.I've lived in South America and have a four-year college degree in Spanish, yet I still learn something new (or relearn something I've forgotten) every time I pick up this book. Students of all ability levels from beginning to very advanced will benefit from this work. That said, I think most beginning students will already have enough on their hands with learning the nuts and bolts of Spanish grammar and acquiring a basic vocabulary. For that reason, I tend to think that a book of this type is better suited for intermediate and up students. Along with a good dictionary like the Larousse Gran Diccionario, this is a must-own reference book for any serious student of the Spanish language."},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"This book is really beyond praise -- one of the most enjoyable and yet edifying books I have ever read. You can see clearly that the author has a real knowledge of the whole Spanish-speaking world, from Spain to Tierra del Fuego. (This is one reason why this book is considerably better than Keenan's book, which focuses on Mexican usage almost exclusively.) In addition to sound advice about False, Unreliable, and Good Friends, (words that appear similar in Spanish and English but whose meanings may or may not be the same) he has some absolutely fascinating tidbits of information: e.g., -barra- in music means the vertical bar-line; what we call a musical bar or measure is comp&aacute;s. Speaking of bars, I think he's had a few nights out with these -hispanohablantes-, and thus he understands the culture in a familiar and deeply amicable way. He has a fine sense of humor and insight. I read the book cover to cover and recommend the same without reservation."},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"It's kind of hard to review a book when you are speechless with admiration. In the US we don't have much of a culture of foreign language learning, so we fail to appreciate the importance of vocabulary. I read a remark by Hemingway once to the effect that when he decided to tackle Spanish he bought a dictionary and began to read, so it lead me to try an experiment. I took a bilingual dictionary and started to read the *English* side and I soon discovered that there was hardly a single English phrase in the entire dictionary (bilingual dictionaries have less vocabulary than a big monolingual dictionaries, naturally) that one would not expect a fluent English speaker to know. This was frightening, because it implied that a fluent Spanish speaker would probably know all the words and idioms on the Spanish side! So how should a native English speaker, who wishes to become fluent in Spanish, make a serious effort at expanding his vocabulary in Spanish? The problem with reading a bilingual dictionary (a la Hemingway) is that such dictionaries are notoriously inaccurate and are virtually completely devoid of contextual information that would serve to illustrate how words are actually used. It would be an exaggeration to say that Bryson's book fills the entire gap; it's too small for that, but it does fill quite a few gaping holes, and it is beautifully written with a lot of amusing anecdotes that help one *remember* what is being taught. He has also changed the way I think about language. His book has taught me, among other things, to always look for English cognates as a means of alerting myself to how Spanish speakers use different metaphors than English speakers to express similar concepts. Before Bryson I was less conscious of the Spanish I used &amp; my mastery was diminished as a result. For that habit of mind, and for the many useful clarifications, I am very grateful. Mr. Bryson thank you so much for this fine book. I only wish there were a few academics who took an interest in offering the kind of service you have offered us. Then perhaps we would have a Colloquial Spanish the size of a Gran Larousse. - John Strong"},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"In an earlier commentary about this book, a reviewer wondered how a $7 paperback could be going for upwards of $140. Well, the answer is: scarcity. This is where you have to be careful. The book listed under the title \\"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish\\" is said to be the third revised edition, published in 1981. That edition is indeed quite rare, which accounts for its fetching big bucks. However, that's not the end of the story. A couple of other reviewers lamented that there isn't an updated version of this book. It turns out there is, but with a different subtitle.Which leads me to my story. After seeing the book offered from one of the online sellers at a \\"bargain basement\\" (compared to all the others, that is) price, I ordered what I thought to be the 1981 edition. When the book arrived, though, I noticed some differences from the picture and publication info I'd seen at Amazon. So I went back and compared ISBN numbers. The book I'd ordered was not the 1981 edition; the ISBN number for that one is 0020794304. The ISBN number on the one I received is 030407943X. Confused, I typed in that number and was startled by the result. The title of the book with that ISBN number was listed as \\"Spanish Colloquial\\", and no author's name was listed anywhere (BTW, Amazon has corrected the title and added the author's name). What's more, the publisher was listed as Orion Publishing Company, not Cassell's. The particularly strange thing about that is the name Orion appears nowhere in the book I have, while the name Cassell's appears several times (I found out later that Orion owned the printing rights to the Cassell's line for several years, but no longer). In addition, the book's cataloging info indicates that the 1981 edition was reprinted three times: 1985, 1988 and 1993. The copy I have is the 1993 reprint, even though the concluding words of the introduction are \\"Abingdon, 1980, A. Bryson Gerrard.\\" My guess is the 1993 reprint is far less rare than the 1981 third edition. To top it all off, several sellers were offering the 1993 printing at prices lower than what I paid.So was I duped? It appears that way. But I'm not going to send the book back, because it does contain everything I was hoping to find in the first place. And I concur wholeheartedly with all of the other reviewers. Gerrard has done a tremendous service to English speakers who are passionate about learning Spanish. Some of the information in Gerrard's book is a bit dated, though, which obviously can't be blamed on him. Just try to recall the state of the Internet in 1980 and you'll understand. I don't know if Mr. Gerrard is dead now, but don't let the passage of two and a half decades dissuade you from enjoying his fine work. However, taking into account the need for a more contemporary reference, I would also recommend \\"Streetwise Spanish\\" -- both volumes, the dialogue book and the dictionary/thesaurus."},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Handbook of Idiomatic Usage (Including Latin-American Spanish)","review":"While I agree with all the comments of previous reviewers on this little gem of a book, I feel that it is incumbent on me to point out what this book is, and what it is not. It is not a general review of Spanish slang. It was not meant to be, and while it covers a fair amount of slang, it is more in the sense of pointing out those types of colloquialisms that are long-standing and which the foreigner should understand when he or she hears them, e.g., common and universal obscenities. For an extensive review of colloquialisms along with background on the ones that are peculiar to specific areas of the Hispanic world, the book &quot;Streetwise Spanish&quot; is a better choice.However, in the field of discussing the basic nuts and bolts of standard spoken Spanish, there is simply no better book on the market than this one. It is true that Joseph Keenan's recent offering, &quot;Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish&quot; offers more in the way of colloquial grammar points, but &quot;Cassell's Colloquial Spanish&quot; will acquaint you with the the sort of vocabulary that you will hear the most often at home, on the street, in the classroom or the office or anywhere else you may end up. If you learn what's in this book you'll be able to communicate effectively 95 percent of the time. What's more, the book is a good read, good enought even to be a bedside book.

In Spain and Mexico it means a \\"file,\\" of the sort used in offices. In Peru it means a \\"desk\\" of the sort used in schools (elsewhere usually pupitre) and in Colombia it means a \\"table-cloth\\" (ornamental; not for meals). I have also heard it used for a \\"brief-case.\\"A carpet, as you know, is una alfombra.

As he goes along, he begins to see things about himself and everyone around him through new eyes with the help of Hawk Trumbull, a God-fearing man that lived in the desert. During this time he constantly had close encounters, both unpleasant and pleasant, with the Paiute Indians, and finally came to a realisation that everyone was not against him.I think this book is well worth reading as it tackles subjects relevant to everyone in a way that makes us think. Similarities are constantly apparent between Zack's problems and real problems we might have in our own lives, and helps us find a way to conquer these problems without directly striking against us which would make many people close their ears.The story is very exciting with a lot of sudden plot twists that compel us to keep reading on, not wanting to put the book down. Each chapter in the book is very short so it dosen't seem like it's taking a long time to finish the book. This book can be read just as a story very well, or one can go deeper and study the underlying messages existing the whole way through the story.The characters of the book are extremely life-like and it is easy to picture each one of them and relate them to people we know in life. The story is believable and seems like it could be an actual journal of somebody's life, which makes it easy for us to follow and relate to.The book teaches us how to look at things carefully and deeply, and not to just take it at face- value. It also teaches us to learn from everything that we observe and try to find it's meaning, as everything has a reason for being there. If the thing we are observing is a problem, we are able to overcome it by studying it in this way.A lesson we learn from this book is that the hardest thing to do for most people is to swallow one's pride and admit that they were wrong. Many people can act tough, and many people believe that those people are \`men' but few of them have the courage to apologise or say that they were wrong.The book shows us how important fatherhood is to a person, both in the actual relationship between the father and the son, as well as being a picture, no-matter how imperfect, of how God cares for us as our Heavenly Father.I think that this is a superb book and would recommend it to anyone having problems with their family life, new Christians for general reading to help them get a better picture of God, as well as to anyone who is just looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Grayfox (The Journals of Corrie Belle Hollister #8)","review":"Grayfox is a most fantastic book. Once I had started on it, I could hardly put it down. I read past midnight and did not want to sleep. Although it is kind of meant more for boys, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The book is not only interesting, but didactic too. Michael Phillips showed Zack Hollister's feelings as a rebellious kid very well. He had also illustrated Drummond's fatherly love very well. Hawk was a good teacher. The Indians and Indian tales that M.P. brought in enhanced the entire plot. The reconciliation at the last was a fitting end. I give this book full ratings. It is sound and promotes moral values, unlike many modern books with explicit details on sexuality and violence.

Ms. Gandel has produced a highly readable book that makes sophisticated concepts accessible to the lay person while providing meaty material for the professional.Wonderfully produced on good quality, high gloss stock, the book is chock full of illustrative material that effectively conveys the excitement of Fukuoka's Canal City Hakata. Readers do not have to puzzle over the term \\"wiggle wall\\" or strain to imagine what the \\"wayfinding sculptures\\" might look like. They can see them clearly in both the wide angle and detail shots.Jon Jerde in Japan starts with the project's genesis in 1977 as the first mixed-use development outside one of Japan's major cities, takes it through opening day in 1996 and concludes with an analysis of its amazing popularity-over 43 million visitors to date! It also traces the development of architect Jon Jerde and his deepening commitment to creating original spaces that add something valuable to the human experience. As Cathie Gandel wrote of Canal City Hakata:A visitor writes his or her script not only by choosing where to shop and where to eat, but also by choosing whether to see a movie, play a video game or have a drink in the Grand Hyatt lounge; walk under the overhang or out in the open; sit, stand and watch, or wander; jump in surprise at the champagne cork-popping noise of the fountains or wade into the tidal pool. Whatever the decision, the visitor is writer and actor as well as audience.\\"I have had such a satisfying time just reading about this \\"urban theater,\\" I can only wonder what it must be like to experience it in person.

The author is a Christian but doesn't grind axes. The book would be good for undergraduates if supplemented with an anthology of classic and modern readings.The bad news: \\"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion\\" doesn't cover any issue in depth, even though it is more than 400 pages long. Few arguments are pursued for more than a few pages. The text often bogs down in an artificial argument/counterargument structure, reminiscent of high school debates. Contemporary philosophers like Plantinga and Mackie are well-covered, but pre-20th cenutury giants like Aquinas, Spinoza, or Hume are barely mentioned.The really bad news: \\"Contemporary Philosophy of Religion\\" exudes a sunny confidence that analytically-trained theists have lately made headway on intractable issues like the \\"passibility\\" of God. This may be the 21st century, but in some circles angels still dance on pins. At times I wanted to close the book and shout, \\"How can anyone possibly KNOW that...[God transcends time, God is perfectly free, God feels human sufferings, etc., etc., etc.,]?\\" Unless you think philosophy has much to say about these mysteries, you can take a pass on much of this book."},{"Title":"Parliamentary usage: 4th ed., containing a new chapter elucidating the legal contract which exists between a member and his organization,","review":"Miss Fox (1847-1945) lived in the Detroit area.

It should noted, however, that Fox's version of parliamentary procedure varies somewhat from the traditional format set forth in Robert's Rules of Order. For example, under Fox's rules, a motion is not properly seconded until the member rises, secures recognition from the chair, and then seconds the motion. Under Robert's Rules of Order, it is sufficient if the chairman merely \\"hears\\" a second.

President Jefferson wanted to explore some of the new territory as well as to establish some claim on the Oregon territory to the West of it. The plan was to look for a route to the source of the Missouri river and from there to the source of the Columbia, and then to follow the Columbia to the Pacific. Captain Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) and Second Lieutenant William Clark (1770-1838) were chosen to lead the expedition.This book tells us a great deal about the expedition of Lewis and Clark, with some great photos of the terrain they encountered. We read about their encounters with grizzly bears, buffalo, fish, and mosquitoes. We find out how they coped with white water (in fact, they were even better than the Native Americans at handling it, although they were no match for the Chinook Indians when there were high waves near the coast). And we learn how they handled portages when they reached waterfalls or had to cross the Continental Divide (they abandoned their canoes and carved new ones at the top of the falls).As the Schmidts explain, the expedition began to get organized in December of 1803, and it left Saint Louis on May 14, 1804. It went upriver on the Missouri to what is now North Dakota (the only death to an expedition member was on this portion of the trip), and the team wintered at Fort Mandan from November, 1804 to April, 1805.The Indians local to Fort Mandan were the Hidatsa. But the ones who lived near the source of the Missouri were the Shoshone. The idea was to find some Shoshones, or even better, a Shoshone guide. The Shoshones could then explain how to get to the source of the Columbia, a region inhabited by the Nez Perce.The official party of 25 left Fort Mandan on April 7, 1805 and headed immediately into uncharted territory. Along with them were Sacagawea (1788-1812), her husband Toussaint Charbonneau (1758-1840?) and their two month old son, Jean-Baptiste (1805-1866). Sacagawea was a Shoshone and spoke both Shoshone and Hidatsa, Toussaint spoke Hidatsa and French, and a member of the Lewis and Clark party spoke French and English. The presence of Sacagawea and her infant son helped assure various Indian tribes that the Lewis and Clark party had peaceful intentions.They reached Great Falls (more than halfway across Montana) in June and Three Forks (the Missouri headquarters, which Sacagawea recognized) in late July. In August, they managed to reach the Lemhi valley (which Sacagawea also recognized) and looked around for some Shoshones. They did indeed find a Shoshone party. Truth being stranger than fiction, the Shoshone chief, Cameawait, turned out to be Sacagawea's brother.The Shoshones did guide the party from the Continental Divide to a tributary of the Columbia. In September, they emerged from the Rocky Mountains, and they soon reached the Clearwater river. In October, they took the Snake river to the Columbia, reaching the Columbia estuary in November.The party wintered at Fort Clatsop in Oregon, and even took Sacagawea to the Pacific to see a beached whale in January. They left Fort Clatsop on March 23, 1806, and were back in Saint Louis exactly six months later.The first transcontinental railroad was completed in May of 1869 by crews which had headed West from Omaha, Nebraska and East from Sacramento, California. I wondered if any of the members of the Lewis and Clark expedition were still alive then. One was, namely Patrick Gass (1771-1870). It is sobering to realize how quickly this previously uncharted land became settled. When one compares the Montana of 1806 with that of 1906 and 2006, the differences are truly remarkable.I highly recommend this book, which tells of a land which has changed greatly in a mere two centuries."},{"Title":"The Long Way to Los Gatos","review":"NOT ONLY THAT, IT WOULD MAKE A KILLER ACTION FLICK OR TV MOVIE! We've known author Verne Albright for years as the affable and articulate announcer at our Peruvian Paso horse shows. And yes, we knew that he rode two Peruvian Paso horses from Peru to the United States in the 1960's. But we didn't know the whole story. What it was REALLY like. Braving vampire bats! Cholera! Typhoid! Malaria! Bubonic plague! Crossing the Matacaballo (Horsekiller) Desert. Or the Andes! The Peak of Death, where the weather is so extreme that people often freeze to death standing up. And the little human problems: The revolution in Nicaragua. Normal anarchy in Colombia. The ever present banditos. Border guards. Logistics: Trying to find food for his horses where there wasn't any. Also horse shoes and vets. (Though he did find a witch doctor. Who cured the horse.) Verne keeps traveling, surpassing one obstacle after another after another until the reader feels like tearing his/her hair out and murdering most of the officials in South America! My God! I was in a state of anxiety the entire time I read this book-- which fortunately wasn't very long. I couldn't put it down. What a tale! Even has a bit of romance. Verne Albright should be a nationally known action hero. Why did he do this? A good question. He was a young guy in his 20's. Seemed like a good idea. He wanted to promote the Peruvian Paso breed. And also, the ride seemed like a good way to condition one of the mares for the Tevis Cup (the 100 mile endurance race) in Auburn. Yeah. Riding her from Peru should do it.

The journey he made as a young man was a mission with this purpose. I'm not a horse expert, but I was truly gripped by his story. He writes in a highly readable style and describes the many people he met, good and bad, with great gentleness and humour. The quality which is foremost in my mind after reading it is persistence. Considering the formidable obstacles he met with daily on his trek - harsh climate, lack of suitable feed, bureaucrats and bandits, he overcomes all of these by enormous dedication, strength of will and courage. This book deserves a much wider audience. I found it truly uplifting."},{"Title":"The Long Way to Los Gatos","review":"Although the book is non-fiction, it reads like fiction.

This book gives a detailed account of Dillinger's early years with his family leading up to his bank robbing criminal career, amazing escapes and his execution by Federal Agents on July 22, 1934 in a dark Chicago alley. I give this book with five stars because of it's accuracy. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the true facts surrounding Dillinger's life as the most wanted man in America."},{"Title":"Dillinger","review":"An excellent biography on John Dillinger. The authors did their homework well! The book features the outlaw's life from beginning to end and it would be an wonderful edition to any Dillinger reader's book collection."},{"Title":"Dillinger","review":"Co-written by Robert Cromie and Joseph Pinkston, perhaps the world's foremost authorities on this particular outlaw, \\"Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life,\\" is a factual, credible, informative biography of one of the most celebrated criminals in the annals of crime. No sensational revelations are unearthed, no secrets revealed, no outlandish accusations. Simply put, one of the better Dillinger books written (and I don't say this because I happen to have an original copy autographed by Robert Cromie in my possession)."},{"Title":"Dillinger","review":"Full of details, it was interesting to note the geographies in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois & Wisconsin that are described in this compact life of a busy criminal"},{"Title":"Dillinger","review":"John Dillinger continues to this day to be one of the most celebrated of American outlaws. Was he a \\"bad bad guy\\" or a \\"good bad guy\\"? The author has done an admirable job in scouring contemporary news and police accounts to try and reach a conclusion, but in the end it is up to the reader to draw their own final opinions. What does appear to be the case is that he grew embittered after receiving what he perceived as an unjust sentence for a strongarm robbery incident, his first major tangle with the law, that he was probably put up to by an older and more experienced accomplice who received a much lighter sentence. Nothing like doing a stretch of hard time to put the finish on one's criminal education. From there he went on to a numerous set of bank heists in a relatively short period of time, a hazardous occupation when the local citizenry as well as armed bank guards would be prone to offer armed resistance. JD captured the public imagination in doing so in a depression ridden America that had no love of banks and big business. While The Dillinger Gang usually tried to avoid shooting anybody, it is still debated today as to whether or not JD shot and killed anybody. The answer in this book is that he wasn't afraid to shoot, and I won't give away the answer as to whether or not he actually killed anybody while plying his trade. Women loved him and men enjoyed his company, and he appeared to have had strong ties with his family, even when he was on the run. He had a short and violent life, per the book's title, and it makes for an engrossing read about a celebrity outlaw and his notorious accomplices."},{"Title":"Dillinger","review":"This is the best of all Dillinger biographies. Forget the speculative fiction of Jay Robert Nash. From birth to violent death, this is the most detailed and accurate account of John Dillinger's life and crimes. The research for this book was done by the late, great Joe Pinkston, a wonderful man and scholar who had researched Dillinger and collected artifacts on America's only real Public Enemy Number One since his own childhood in the '30's, eventually turning his lifelong fascination into the John Dillinger Historical Museum formerly located at Nashville, Indiana. Only slightly marred by the lack of source notes or index, this book is still a handy reference work, the proper beginning for any student of Dillinger and a priceless addition to any crime library."},{"Title":"Building the Human","review":"Robert Johann SJ calls himself an applied philosopher. This is not easy bedtime reading, but for those who persevere through prose that at first brush may appear dense, but which is actually very lucidly written, the profundity shines through. Studied meditations on the human condition bring together disparate strands of humanism and existentialism to shed light on what it means to be a person."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Small Town","review":"It sounds like this book suffers from a marketing problem. I checked it out of a public library once, not knowing anything about it, and I found it an enjoyable, memorable read that was both humorous and a little bit disturbing. The publisher's promise of \\"secrets concerning murder, incest, and more\\" is misleading, but the book has its own value, and the inaccurate marketing did the author a disservice by inviting a condescending review like the \\"Publisher's Weekly\\" comment on this book's Amazon page. If the reviewer hadn't been expecting salacious tales of murder, maybe s/he would have realized that stories about people accidentally killing their own pets, gaining religious faith but being afraid to admit it, and having an illicit crush get at the heart of human feeling.It's been years since I read the book, but I remember some stories exactly; to me, their quotidian nature didn't make them boring. Just the fact that some of these stories are even considered shameful enough to hide says something about our society. I also remember noticing that some secrets were common to more than one person: the one that stands out to me is that several \\"secret sharers\\"--who apparently didn't know each other--sincerely believed they were aliens from another planet.The book merely reports the secrets, mostly briefly, so I can't say it's a particularly deep investigation of small towns. But if you're interested in social history at all, I think you'll find some things to like in this small book."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Small Town","review":"I remember reading this, some really freaky stuff indeed. Here's the low-down. An author picks an American town and gets a hotel room. He then puts an ad in the paper for people to come to his room and anomynously tell him their dirty secrets. They could not write a letter, they could not call on the phone. To be in the book, they had to come in person and be interviewed.One guy has the strangest of fetishes. He likes to sit in public restrooms and listen to people deficate. Others were stories of childhood escapades, but some were witness to horrifying accounts within their family.Not a very large book, you can easily finish it in an afternoon, but there is at least one story in this book for everyone. It will hit home and stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Small Town","review":"I'd hardly call these secrets \\"extraordinary.\\" Most of them aren't, anyway. Just to clarify: the author did pick a random town, but what he did was walk up to people, explain the idea for the book, and if the person wanted to reveal things he'd record them. People were allowed to submit things in writing (an entire class does that), and one of the most disturbing secrets is from someone who remains anonymous.This book isn't really what I expected it to be. Most entries are half a page long. And most are not exactly secrets. Mostly you get someone who's still upset that they stole something or disobeyed their parents. Not exactly titillating. There are a few gems. Like the woman who fantasized about having sex with a donkey. The aforementioned man who likes to listen to people defecate. A man who made love to his girlfriend while listening to Barry Manilow and who cannot hear the songs now without getting an erection. A few nice revenge stories. There's also a lot of tales of rape and molestation (the sheer number of the stories, in this short book, makes you question the overall goodness in humanity).But the bad outweighs the good. There's too much filler. The book is a quick read. I read it in a few hours. So if the description turns you on, and you think you'd like it, you might as well give it a read. But if you're looking for something wild and weird, you'll probably be a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Small Town","review":"could have been developed into a short story collection and it would have made better reading."},{"Title":"Processing of Particulate Solids (Particle Technology Series)","review":"This is a great reference book for anyone new to particle technology (or any of its fields) and also serves as a great starting point for new researchers.

I am struggling to realize my place in a multifaced, complex web-world and have never felt comfortable with the typical feminist need to stand out in the foreground. It is also very empowering to see that there have been many versions of woman-based cultures. Unlike those in Crete, for example, tribal cultures were fully functioning in North America less than 500 years ago! It is unfortunate (though not at all surprising, given the difficulty of writing about concepts in the language of the patriarchy) that this gospel of hope and renewal is not reaching many, many people--especially our young people in colleges and universities.

That said, I think it's invaluable reading--probably a &quot;must read&quot; for those really interested in the field of Native American studies. I found it extremely interesting and useful. I also found it unsettling and even offensive in places. In spite of attacking white culture for reducing everything to ethnocentric formulas (a point she illustrates very persuasively), Allen seems to me to do the same thing throughout the book. While criticizing white academics for robbing Native Americans of thier complexity as individuals, she tends to see every possible issue through a polarized perspective--Native American=Good, White culture=bad. Doesn't this, in fact, rob Native Americans of their complexity as individuals and lead to the very romanticizing that Allen objects to?Still, as irritating as I find this reductive way of arguing, I have to admit that this is a very valuable book."},{"Title":"Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions","review":"I am very pleased with my order.

Missy is so enthralled with him that she follows him into the waters of Centaurus where she is held captive in the Kirilanrian stronghold. With Missy captive, Gibe hopes to control Sybil and her actions as he has begun to control the inhabitants. Sybil has friends both in the seas and on land.

Especially when they want to have a baby not with said ex-husband, from a test tube. And women who thrives on lists, schedules and post-it notes do not belong with men who's chaotic lives negate the ability to make a date, an appointment, or any other schedule.So after a whirlwind courtship and a wedding a city hall, it seems inevitable that Melanie Spears would walk out on her undercover-cop husband Sonny Randle and obtain a divorce. But Sonny's not giving up. Now he knows what he did wrong and he's prepared to fix it. He buys the ramshackle house across the street from Melanie and begins his plan to win her back before a test tube takes his place. And his planning blows Melanie's carefully scheduled life into chaos.Ordinarily I would be skeptical of a plot bringing together ex-spouses, but author Mary McBride pulls it off with aplomb.

This is hardly a pamphlet for the labor movement or the Communist Party, though, as Steinbeck is less interested in pontificating than showing the frustations of the workers and the toll that their resistence actually takes on them and the local community. It also shows the organizational difficulties involved in getting a diverse group of dissatisfied workers to work for a common cause. The characterization is vivid and brilliant. Aside from its obvious literary value, this novel also has historical value, for like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (although with greater realism and much less pathos) it provides a powerful description of the plight of working people in America earlier in the 20th century. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" gives readers a good idea of the type of courage it took, and still does take, to fight for positive change and social justice."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Steinbeck masters several different purposes with this book. First, he provides us with, in typical Steinbeck fashion, an in-depth character study of several figures worthy of discussion. The characters are intriguing, life-like and hold our attention as they move through their existence.Second, he weaves a picturesque and spellbinding story with this ability to animate scenes with his words. He truly captures the idea of &quot;suspension of disbelief;&quot; the reader has no doubt he/she is reading about real places and people.Last and most important, Steinbeck turns the tables on the reader in the last paragraph of the book. While this book may superficially appear to be a scathing commentary on the ruthlessness of unchecked capitalism, its really a singular question on human nature, regardless of the dominant socio-economic system, be it capitalism or communism. The reader must make up his/her mind at the end on which is the worse crime: exploitation of the masses for profit or exploitation of the masses for personal power and position, especially at the expense of a friend and allie.One of the most powerful books I have read in such a few number of pages."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story. That says a lot about a man who did such great character studies as Of Mice And Men, The Grapes Of Wrath, The Winter Of Our Discontent, and The Pearl. In this story, Steinbeck hits a raw note rarely reached in American Literature. Few people would have it in them to write a story about the &quot;Reds&quot; in the 1930s. Steinbeck not only wrote the story, he made it his masterpiece. The story alone is the best he ever published. A story about a migrant worker strike in California and the effects of an ununionized strike unfold in the novel. The more important part of the novel is the humanist views Steinbeck took. Every man can feel the hate of the system tearing you apart. He captures that hate in all 300 pages of this story. In every aspect, he captured people who have been pushed too far in In Dubious Battle. He told the story of men who had nothing to lose and in the end lost anyway. This is not another story of the underdog. This is the story of the American Dream being left unfulfilled."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Like the preceding reviewer, I felt that Warren French's essay offered a very poor introduction to this novel. It isn't simply that French gives too much of the story away; that could be solved simply be reading the 'introduction' later. More bothersome is how his analysis is based mainly on elements that are exterior to the novel (a few comments in Steinbeck's personal letters, historical anecdotes...) but remains largely at odds with the novel itself.Contrary to French's convoluted claims, the novel is first and foremost a careful study of various aspects of worker/capital confrontation, played out in the form a depression era fruit pickers' strike. Steinbeck uses his two main characters, Mac and Jim - two 'communist agitators' who are instrumental in whipping up sentiments of resistance among the workers - to offer a 'big picture' perspective of the organizational aspects of the confrontation. The bulk of the novel explores tactics, with many of the typical property owner ploys and worker counterploys represented, and it attempts to dissect and explain the vicissitudes of worker morale (and, to a lesser extent, to explore the psychology of those acting on the side of the forces of repression). The specifics may be dated, but anyone involved in social struggles today will immediately recognize most of the tactics and the psychology. I am thinking less of contemporary strikes in North America, which have generally evolved into less violent confrontations, and more of struggles where people are still fighting to gain the power of solidarity. Worker struggles in the third world come to mind, but also the larger struggle to establish unity against the neoliberal agenda. Participants in recent 'antiglobalization' protests, for instance, will see many familiar elements in \\"In Dubious Battle\\" .French's contention that \\"In Dubious Battle\\" is a 'bildungsroman' is also pretty far off the mark. It is true that Jim, undergoing his apprenticeship as an organizer/agitator, is revealed to be a natural tactician. But generally the characters remain constants throughout the novel. I would agree with other commentators here who have complained that the personalities are somewhat stiff - ceratinly, that is, in comparison with the depth with which Steinbeck usually imbues his characters.Steinbeck is only minimally concerned with 'character development' in this novel. He is more concerned with the ways in which broad social solidarity develops, and also with some of the concomitant tactical and moral issues. Steinbeck shows strikers resorting to violence, and yet he describes the overall situation accurately enough to make the reader fully aware that, faced with an enemy which has overwhelming control over property and legal apparatus, these are very often the only means for workers to trigger awareness of the need for larger solidarity.French claims that the battle \\"is dubious not because the outcome is uncertain... but rather because it was the kind of struggle that should never have occurred at all.\\" This, in my mind, totally misses the point. Steinbeck clearly recognizes that the battle *must* be fought for workers to improve their lot. The failure of the apple pickers' strike is certain, but just as certain is the fact that it will pull workers together in future and discourage the growers from being quite as mercilessly exploitative. The \\"dubious\\" part has to do with the means by which the battle is fought, and particularly the tendency to sacrifice individuals and small groups unscrupulously to a larger cause. Doc Burton is the only character who fully grasps the implications of this; namely, that the ultimate goal towards which Mac and the 'reds' are fighting - i.e. a classless (and non-violent) society - is undermined by the means which they are using.For those who are new to Steinbeck and are looking primarily for a good read, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" offers a much more moving evocation of exploitation and discrimination. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" has its fair share of excitement, but it is a primarily a practical (and consequently more prosaic) analysis of the realities of fighting exploitation ."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"The best book by Steinbeck. Gritty down in the dirt daily lives of workers. In today's world people forget that it was the Communists who fought and won many benifits workers enjoy now."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Having just come out of a 49-day strike myself, I can say Steinbeck captures the logistics of a strike: the manipulation by the media against the strikers, the changes moods of the strikers, the importance of gathering public support. Steinbeck gives a balanced view of manipulators on both sides:the leaders of the strike and the employers. Jim Nolan, the protagonist,is lead by an over-zealous racical, Mac, into riling up disenfranchized apple pickers in a fictious town in California. Steinbeck's talent is in making you experience the strike in real-time, ugly warts and all. Although I felt the ending was harsh, Steinbeck gives the reader a lasting and haunting image of the kinds of sacrafices that were made to fight for the rights of working stiffs. I was most impressed by the vivid characters, an economy and dimension of a Doesteovski novel, as well as an ability to capture scene. I wanted to see more of the aftermath of the strike, but Steinbeck ends the novel like a kick in the gut. Almost too abrupt for my taste, but, alas, this is a classic and well worth the time of anyone wanting to better understand the dubious nature of a strike--its work never finished in a single lifetime."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"\\"In Dubious Battle\\" is not Steinbeck's best novel. It's heavy on the preaching of workingman values, uses characters to convey belief in that awkward way you see in blatantly political novels, and it ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, as if Steinbeck were racing against a deadline.But it's refreshing to read the novel in light of today's capital-dominated society. While the poor get steadily poorer, and the rich richer, Steinbeck's message still resonates today. Steinbeck's characters fight barehanded against orchard monopolies and their collected police and vigilante forces armed with guns, tear gas, and money. The Red agitators at the center of the story spark the day laborers' fear and anger and incite a strike, which brings the men together brandishing hope instead of guns. We could take a lesson from the Depression-era strikers and demand a fairer, more just society, one they so obviously failed to win for us.Though stiff and ragged as it is, the novel also haunted me as I read it. While the conditions of oppressive capital exists now more strongly than ever, the workingman's struggle is long dead. In fact, today's average working stiff is the guy in the novel who loves his truck so much that he won't risk it in the battle for his own humanity. It's not until the truck is destroyed that he becomes truly vengeful.So when you're blue about suburban sprawl, when you spend day after day in a cubicle working on meaningless projects, or when you watch our nation's highest offices sell to the highest bidders, pick up this book and howl."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is one of those books that changes the way you see the world.I've read a few of Steinbeck's books, including the big ones and some of the smaller ones.In Dubious Battle is just as excellent as Grapes of Wrath, only in a smaller way. After I finished this book, I sat and thought for a long time, unable to get it out of my mind.This is not to be missed. Entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I'm disappointed to read that some folks regard the characters in this great book as caricatures - rather, they reflect the hard-working, strong-willed people that struggled so during the Great Depression, and made huge headway in business, that we today benefit from. With this in mind, I want to sing Steinbeck's praises for a moment, and thank him for making a difference in his own time. He was unafraid of putting the spotlight on a difficult truth in American history, and doing so effectively.This book is distinct from The Grapes of Wrath, in that it studies closer the reality of an actual strike, and the involvement of the Communist Party therein. As the reader follows the experience of Jim and Dan, the lead characters, their strengths and flaws come to the surface, as they struggle to keep the strike underway, and the men and women involved strong. Their trials and tribulations are realistic, and depicted in an edge-of-your-seat manner. The ending, much like that of Grapes, is a heart-wrencher, perhaps even moreso. Any reader with heart and conscience is left stunned, and provoked. Although the book is a work of fiction, it is surely not far from the truth. Truly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Efforts of workers in this country to organize and to fight for fair wages and decent working conditions have been long and extremely arduous. The history of the labor movement has been fraught with violence and bloodshed. It was not until Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal that Congress passed laws allowing workers to organize and to strike for the conditions which should have been rightfully theirs all along.Set in California in the 1930s, _In Dubious Battle_ accurately depicts individuals who strike when the owners of the orchard in which they pick apples decide to reduce their pay. The book documents these workers' extreme poverty and hunger, as well as their fears of bodily harm or even death at the hands vigilantes and police with whom they must contend during the strike. Their leaders, some of whom are on the extreme left political fringes, are men of fervor and dedication who are willing to sacrifice their own lives in the struggle. Steinbeck who often wrote of the sufferings of the common people, to his credit, presents a balanced portrait of these men. Bullying unarmed strikers into a fighting frenzy against men who possess deadly weapons, exploiting the martyrs in their ranks, and stealthily committing arson as methods of gaining them sympathy, were considered ethical acts that justified their worthy ends. One of the book's great strengths was its non-fictional, documentary feel. Admittedly, Steinbeck's matter of fact approach and dialogue sometimes dulled the book's dramatic impact. On the whole, though, I felt as if I were living amongst very realistic people, experiencing their disappointments fighting a dubious battle in an ultimately successful war for economic freedom of all working people."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Unlike Steinbeck's other works, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" exhibits much more of a social conscience toward the need of the average man. Aside from \\"The Grape of Wrath\\" and \\"The Moon is Down\\", this trait of Steinbeck is not always evident in his work. Although communism is never mentioned by name, the book is centered around the laborers that organize in a fruit strike in the California Valley. In his storytelling, flaws are revealed on both ends of the spectrum so it would be inaccurate to call this book pro-communist. Yet the pro-labor leanings expressed in the book may reveal a preference.Jim Nolan is new to the movement, leaving his past life with the idea of making a difference. While he initially seems to be the main character, the focus becomes quite broad. \\"The party\\" plans to incite a strike and seeks employment as pickers with this in mind. As the plot is sets up, the story moves somewhat slowly in the initial pages. The reader may find himself/herself waiting for the descent to begin as rage gradually builds among the workers.As the strike begins, the characters begin to take shape in a form similar to characters in Steinbeck's other works. As the rules of working life are removed, some of the men struggle without structure in their lives. While Jim becomes familiar with the life of the party, Mac and London act as a guiding force with the future in mind. However, Doc is the steady force in the novel as he provides a remarkably objective eye toward the movement. Although his role is less prominent, he may be the most complete character in the book.My only real disappointment in the novel is that I felt it ended to abruptly. The factions are headed toward what is seemingly their ultimate clash as the story draws to a close. While the answer of a war between communist and capitalistic ideas has seemingly been won in the real world, one has to wonder how it ended in the world created by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is a story of the attempt of the Communist Party to infiltrate the labor movement. Using the rage of migrant farm workers against the unfair labor practices of the California agricultural community, and anything else possible, up to and including the dead bodies of their friends, labor organizers convince growing numbers of workers to organize. The title of the book, &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; discusses the dubious choices made by the leaders of the labor movement of that time, inserting socialist ideals and abdicating conscience for the &quot;cause&quot; in many cases. It traces the slow evolution of its main character as the plight of workers versus values such as the rights of farmers, and morality, to name two, bring him to make choices."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Steinbeck has an amazing way of just grabbing you by the neck and thrusting you into the full swing of a strike. He manages to keep up so much tension and suspense throughout that you're just dying for more and more. One word of advice, don't bother reading the introduction by Warren French. It not only gives away the ending, some parts of it sound more as if he were venting some personal vendetta against the Yale professor and literary critic, Harold Bloom. Smack of jealousy? Anyway, it may seem irrelevent to be reading a book about commies in this age of time but I really liked the way Steinbeck was trying to humanise the other side and to show that at the end of the day we were all just human beings. Especially poignant was the constant reference to the mob mentality and how people change completely and adopt animalistic characteristics void of humanity or those associated with the individual. It's scary, how we can degenerate. Just look at the world around us today. Both 'good' and 'evil' are guilty of this i'm afraid. Oh well..."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story. That says a lot about a man who did such great character studies as Of Mice And Men, The Grapes Of Wrath, The Winter Of Our Discontent, and The Pearl. In this story, Steinbeck hits a raw note rarely reached in American Literature. Few people would have it in them to write a story about the &quot;Reds&quot; in the 1930s. Steinbeck not only wrote the story, he made it his masterpiece.The story alone is the best he ever published. A story about a migrant worker strike in California and the effects of an ununionized strike unfold in the novel. The more important part of the novel is the humanist views Steinbeck took. Every man can feel the hate of the system tearing you apart. He captures that hate in all 300 pages of this story. In every aspect, he captured people who have been pushed too far in In Dubious Battle. He told the story of men who had nothing to lose and in the end lost anyway.This is not another story of the underdog. This is the story of the American Dream being left unfulfilled."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This novel, John Steinbeck's first to win acclaim from both the public and critics, is a precursor to his THE GRAPES OF WRATH, and one of the best proletarian novels ever written. It's about the effort of a group of farm workers to organize and their ultimate defeat by the field owners.Jim Nolan joins the Communist party and goes to the camp of a group of fruit pickers in Torgas Valley for training. Soon the strike breaks out; the orchard owners try to bribe the strike leaders (Dakin and London), to no avail, and then bring in strikebreakers from San Francisco. Things get nasty and violent, with men getting beaten up, some shot (Jim and a character named Joy), and the strikers destroying some of the orchards. The book ends on an exciting and passionate note when Jim is ambushed and shot and Mac, another strike organizer, retrieves his body and pleads the striker's cause over his dead body.Steinbeck's novel is insightful and dramatic. It is written almost totally in dialogue, and the men's speech is raw and brutal. Although his sympathies are obviously on the side of the strikers, he doesn't deify them or demonize the opposition. Mac thinks of the strikers as mere pawns and feels the right to do anything to succeed. Doc Burton who comes to the striker's camp in charge of sanitation, is an interesting character because of his neutrality - he doesn't care about the politics involved and refuses to moralize. Steinbeck ends the book in uncertainty: we never really find out what happens with the strikers, their cause, their success. The chief strength of the book lies in Steinbeck's characterizations; the men are well drawn and true to their natures (though one-dimensional, a fault here that was magnificently corrected in THE GRAPES OF WRATH). A powerful book and a defining book in Steinbeck's canon."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"after i read this book I had a feeing of depression, anger, and inspiration all at once. steinbedk has a frighteningly sharp insight and imagination"},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"The novel is, from its shell, seemingly one of Steinbeck's most objective novels. However, analysing this work, you should find that it is in fact a wonderful experiment in psychological writing for mister Steinbeck. The novel analyses mob mentality and the devestation it can inflict, but also is one of the first of his works to include his &quot;group-man&quot; theory, that a cooperative group is man. As for souls, they do not exist in an individual sense, only when man is one, together. While Steinbeck ardently disagreed with the tactics of Communists, this &quot;group-man&quot; suggests a natural socialism...

Steinbeck engages with the reader with symbolic themes such as struggle of the exploited proletariat and the dissenting views of 1930's America in this story about the rise of a local fruit pickers strike. As usual, Steinbeck does a great job throwing the reader into a vivid setting he has created- while at the same immersing the reader into the everyday struggle of the \\"working class\\" American with nothing to lose. Steinbeck's inclusion of real characters who are not shy to have a opposing opinion about the importance of the drive of the primary protagonists plays an vital role in the story.

This book changed my mind about a good many things: the nature and results of capitalism, labor unions, socialism, work, wages, the individual and the group, destiny, and free will and choice, to say nothing of Steinbeck himself. Once I was able to break out of the mindset that Steinbeck wasn't saying what I felt he should be saying about America and our way of life, I was able to see that to be a part of our lifestyle is not necessarily to agree with it, and that our adopted lifestyle is not inherently good and fulfilling for all. Challenging things to consider, that all things are not black and white, cause and effect. What courage Steinbeck has to see and believe these things, let alone write about them with such honesty, objectivity and grace. It is not his most complete work, but to judge it against &quot;Grapes&quot; or &quot;Winter of our Discontent&quot; is to do disservice to this book's own merits.

In a sense, reading &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; is an educational experience in safe voyeurism.

The laborers had little recourse and no bargaining room.This story chronicles the birth of the union. It is not how the war was won, but how the battles were waged. These pages are filled with the unity of the men. How they came together and how they fell apart. How leaders were raised and how a directed mob could operate independently of direction.Steinbeck was so committed to the tale. It is timed coinciding with the Grapes of Wrath but it is a completely different story. In this book a reader will not find the starvation aspect that was so present in Grapes of Wrath, nor will they find the family element that bound those pages. It is unique.As always, I am amazed with John Steinbeck. He knew something of man and he shared a bit of it in each of his books. In Dubious Battle he wrote:\\"There aren't any beginnings,\\" Burton said. \\"Nor any ends. It seems to me that man has engaged in a blind and fearful struggle out of a past he can't remember into a future he can't forsee nor understand. And man has met and defeated every obstacle, every enemy except one. He cannot win over himself. How mankind hates itself.\\""},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"John Steinbeck's 1936 novel, In Dubious Battle, follows a labor strike by apple pickers who are attempting to combat a reduction in wages. The novel mainly focuses on the efforts of Jim Nolan, a new member of the Communist Party, who is mentored by Mac McLeod, a long time Party member and experienced labor organizer. Together, these two men try to motivate (and manipulate) the disgruntled workers into standing up for themselves against the land owners who have cut back their salaries.Nolan is emblematic of the disenfranchised worker. He comes from poverty and has watched his father fight against the system only to be beaten down by it. His mother took solace in religion, but it also provided no answers, merely a short, hard miserable life. Jim eschews vices like drinking and smoking, as well as the company of women, mainly because he doesn't want to get \\"nibbled to death\\" by responsibilities that stem from having a family to care for. He only feels alive when he's fighting the system.Mac is more cynical than Nolan, willing to use anything and anyone to achieve his goals. He coaches the younger man on the best ways to organize the striking workers, but also draws strength from the fiery Nolan.As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear that there are two sides surrounding the striking men. On one side are the interests of the land owners and on the other, the interests of the radicals. The outcome of the strike itself (and the men involved) becomes less important than the statement it sends to the other side. The landowners wish to crush the strike to make it clear that their authority is absolute and to prevent future challenges to that authority. The radical organizers don't care whether the strike succeeds or not, so long as it inspires more men to join their cause. Lost in the middle are the men who merely want to work for a decent living and need the strike to make their point.Steinbeck doesn't take either side, but his compelling characters and descriptive prose illustrate the conflict, painting a portrait informed by reality. I enjoyed this novel almost as much asThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics),East of Eden, andCannery Row: (Centennial Edition). If you're a fan of Steinbeck's writing and haven't read this one yet, make sure you pick it up."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"In Dubious Battle (a quote taken from John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\") is a short powerful novel which will hit you in the solar plexus of your literary being. John Steinbeck wrote three powerful novels of labor unrest in California in the 1930s:\\"In Dubious Battle\\"; \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men\\".The Plot: Young Jim Nolan joins the Communist Party. He becomes a field worker who is assigned to foment a labor strike in the apple growing region of California. Steinbeck is good in describing the physical setting of the Torgas Valley where the action of the novel transpires. Nolan works with veteran organizer \\"Mac.\\" Mac is a tough old bird who has seen it all!The book is filled with bloody conflict between the orchard owners and the strikers ending in a tragic climax. There are many fascinating characters in this novel including London a striker and Lisa a young woman who gives birth during the strike. Battles between the scabs and strikers show the bitterness of this Depression era narrative. The book is a \\"bildungsroman\\" as we see naive Jim Nolan become a leader among the workers fighting for better pay. As a result of his struggle he gains in maturity and his potential for leadership is realized.Steinbeck's forte is the earthy dialogue he handles so well. He narrates the story in a reportial style avoiding author commentary. He was always on the side of the poor and oppressed.Your reviewer despises Communism!

No other time in American history exemplifies this best than the Great Depression when transplanted Okies worked up and down the West Coast. In In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck, a group of migrant workers courageously decided to strike against the powerful and wealthy landowners. Wonderfully written, In Dubious Battle engrosses the reader easily eliciting reaction ranging from outrage to shock.First of all, I was outraged at the owners attempts to break the strike. The owners seemed to have control over just about every thing in the city. For example, the owners hired people called vigilantes to start trouble and then the coops blamed the strikers for the trouble and tried to arrest them. Next, the owners had the newspapers write that the people who got shot were shot by the strikers. A wonder example of how the process used by the owners worked was when a farmer naned Anderson, who let the strikers stay on his farm. The vigilantes burned down his farm, and the papers placed the blame in the strikers. Clearly, the vigilantes and the papers worked for the owners. The puplic did not really know that the strikers were the good guys. The public thought that the strikers were organized crime. For that reason the owners outrage me the most, for decieving the public. However, I was also shocked at how the police and newspapers were seemingly controlled by the owners. The police are supposed to uphold the law at all times. But when one of the strikers was shot and killed by the vigilantes, the cops tried to blame the rest of the strikers, even though the cops knew that the vigilantes did the killing. The papers were also aware of the truth, yet they also blamed the strikers and print editorials written to make the strikers look like organized crime. One of their editorials actually endorsed violence against the strikers:&quot;We believe the time had come to take action...This paper doesnto ad has never believed inviolence; but it does believe that when the law is not sufficient enough to cope eith these kinds of malcontents and miderers, an aroused citezenry must take a hand...&quot;Besides being impressed with how the story got my attention, I was also impressed the the main character, Jim. He was knew to the whole strike idea and was literally learning as he went along. During the story, Jim is under the guidance of a man named Mac, who is in charge. What impresses me the most is Jim's ability to be the only person who is thinking rationally in times of disorder among the rest of the strikers. THis is illustrated best when the strikers turn into a frenzied mob after someone got beat up. Jim, who is at the moment injured, uses his head to not join the mob to attack the owners, who have used the police to barricade the roads. I often thinkthat rationality is the only advantage the strikers have.To sum uo, In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck is a wonderful book to read, as are all John Steinbeck novels. A person would read about the hadship endured by the migrant workers in a history book by they would only understand whoat happened by reading one of Steinbeck's novels concerning this subject."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

In Dubious Battle is a great tale that incorporates the lifestyle of an applepicker with the idea of forming a union. He follows his tradition by keeping the content of his novel in a fashion that portrays a realistic and timely picture of the life that was lived by the workers in the Torgas Valley, and the others around the nation. Mac and Jim (the main characters) provide an indepth look at the times when a union was considered Communist, and themselves being &quot;Red&quot; for promoting the idea of striking, picketing and forming a union. Not only does In Dubious Battle include the realism already mentioned, but also has many places where Steinbeck infuses his ideas about the world into his characters. In Dubious Battle is a classic story of the common American worker trying to make a decent wage and live a fulfilling life."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"&quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; reads like the last few chapters of Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;: polemical, propagandist, and two-dimensional. Of course, Steinbeck is always a fabulous writer, but this work simpply can't compare to &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;East of Eden&quot;. The characters are types (the cold-blooded radical, the hot-blooded radical, the straight and simple working-class leader) without the perfect nuances of individual character that one usually finds in Steinbeck's creations. The prose is less poetic than in his earlier novels; if you're the sort that hates Dickens and Hardy and you skipped the rambling descriptive chapters if &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; I guess that wouldn't be a minus though. But unless you're a die-hard Steinbeck fan, you might as well skip this one in my opinion."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I love this book! I don't know how many times I've reread it, but it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's works."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is novel was an interesting book to someone who is interested in history, but for most others it is rather dry. The main character, Jim Nolan, is at time likable and also despicable. The other characters are not as endearing as those from &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot;. If you are looking to read a GOOD Steinbeck novel then read one of the aforementioned, but spare yourself from reading this novel. It reads quickly and is easy to understand, but it just doesn't grab you like his other books. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the highly accurate portryal of migrant life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Good Service, received on time, book was a bit beat up but was acceptable since it was used. No Complaints."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"East of Eden.\\" Instead I have focused on \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and his lesser known works, such as \\"To a God Unknown\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Pastures of Heaven.\\" I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.When I began reading \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work. Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell. There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again. After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue. It simply never does.Summary of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" - Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired.The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking. And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book. Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense......and eating. Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food. There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters. But I advise any reader of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down. You won't miss anything. Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.I suppose now I'll give \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a go. Perhaps if it isn't one of his \\"greats,\\" it isn't worth reading."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I know it's considered sacrilige to be critical of the great John Steinbeck, but this book is an insufferable soap box bore. If the characters didn't repeat themselves so endlessly, 100 pages could have been shaved off, and the book would be better for it. There was not one character in the story I cared about, and I was relieved to reach the end."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"In Dubious Battle was written before Grapes of Wrath, and when read you can see the later, and better book taking shape.

LImited in scope, compared to the epic journey of TGOW, but just as powerful, and with the same fine work."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Published in 1936, this book is Steinbeck's fictional investigation of a strike by migratory fruit pickers in California. It narrates a clash between struggling manual laborers and the corporate owners of apple orchards. The owners have surprised the workers by suddenly dropping the rates they are willing to pay. Enter two Communist agitators spouting their Red doctrine and attempting to incite the pickers to strike and riot against the Capitalists. The agitators have well-organized socialist backing that provides them with funds and contacts, food and propaganda in their pitched battle. The responsibility of the duo, Mac and Jim, is to get the strikers to follow one of their own, London, with his leftist leanings, in the uprising. Steinbeck is sympathetic to the organizers and workers. But, is that sympathy warranted by the facts? The workers were willing to pick at the lower rates, although that would probably mean lower rates for harvesting the upcoming cotton crop as well. Mac and Jim stir them into action using psychological tacticts they have used in previous organizational attempts. On the other hand, the police appear willing to keep mayhem to the minimum. Yet, vigilantes, on the side of the corporations, elicit revenge in the form of shootings and arson. I have read the book carefully, but I must admit that I am confused. As a person who grew up during the years of Commie hunters, the Cold War, and all things Red are wrong, this book forces me to take a long, hard look at my ingrained beliefs. I guess that's good. Anything that makes a person think has to be beneficial. I don't know if I can resolve this issue in my mind, but it has given me things to think about when I am trying to go to sleep at night; and keeping me awake, too. It should also be noted that Steinbeck joined the the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, the year before this book came out. His Communist aspirations led to government scrutiny, especially by the IRS. Oh, if you are trying to quit smoking, I would avoid this book. Steinbeck does a masterful job in recreating the physical and social joys of lighting up. Almost made me go out and buy a pack."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I admire Steinbeck for his beautiful descriptions, his mastery of dialogue and his ability to weave tension and dynamism into his stories, and all three qualities are abundantly on display in this early novel, which I believe is often overlooked. It's one of his best."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Though perhaps I have not trodden the halls of American literature as thoroughly as some, it seems to me that there are few American novels whose heroes are Communist organizers. This is one. An experienced labor organizer and strike director (Mac) takes an enthusiastic tyro (Jim) under his wing. They are soon called to lead a strike among the apple pickers of a California county. How they do it and the conduct of the strike is the subject of the book. The two organizers arrange support from sympathizers in the community, some of whom pay a heavy price for their ideals. Mac operates on an ad-hoc basis, using anything as grist for the mill of Revolution. The strike surfs on waves of violence caused chiefly by the so-called forces of law and order, which servilely do the bidding of the orchard owners and bankers. I wondered, as I read, if Steinbeck would turn against collectivist ideals, which hold that the individual is of no importance in the struggle to overthrow the ruling class. No, he does not. I happen to believe that the end does not justify the means. Here, you will find the opposite argument. That's why I felt that these were tarnished heroes, even if bold and ingenious, struggling valiantly and selflessly for their cause. Social justice is, at last, more important than simple class struggle. Overthrowing everything seems---in the light of the last century of history---to be equivalent to throwing the baby out with the bath water. A character called \\"Doc\\" intimates as much, but his voice is less heard. But, the title intrigues me. What does the adjective \\"dubious\\" actually refer to ? It could be Steinbeck's own question---why is this battle necessary? Or, is the fight against capitalism and oppression of workers the right one ? Or again, is such a fight at all possible, given the power that the owners can wield ? Readers will come to their own conclusions, but you have to admire the ability of the writer.The prose flows swiftly and with masterful dashes of color, interludes of calm, and perceptive portraits of working \\"stiffs\\", as he calls them. Insights on mob psychology and the nature of protest and strikes fill the pages. IN DUBIOUS BATTLE was one of Steinbeck's earlier novels, when his anger at the condition of the working class in America waxed white hot. If you ever wondered why Steinbeck was so popular in the USSR, you will understand after reading this work. It seems to me that it is not much talked about today in the USA, when there is rising resentment of an unjust system, but it should be."},{"Title":"In dubious battle, (Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"\`In Dubious Battle' is the first of Steinbeck's depression era books (which also comprises \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath) and whilst often overlooked in favour of the later two books, it is very much in the same vein. It has tight, richly evocative language and a story line that highlights the struggles of the time whilst offering up an engrossing plot. Following Jim Nolan, who helps in an apple pickers strike, this book makes you feel the anguish and frustrations of the workers being bullied and exploited by their employers and by the end you are feeling wrung out and exhausted as only a great book can make you feel. There was some controversy when this book was published and it was deemed to be sympathetic to communists and communism, but more than anything else it is a book about the down trodden and overlooked in society. I admit I am a fan of Steinbeck and his work, but even taking that into account this is exceptional even by his high standards. The language captures you immediately and you feel yourself admiring certain turns of phrase on a regular basis and your emotions being stimulated throughout, whether they be anger, sadness, loneliness, happiness or a whole gamut of other feelings. The story keeps you engaged until it's shattering conclusion and like \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath' it hits you with full impact and imprints itself on your memory to play over again and again over the coming days after you finish the book.

Leschetizky was a student of Czerny, who studied with Beethoven. There is a charming dedication to Leschetizky--a bit of history--where Bree thanks him for all he has taught her and asks him to ensure that she has accurately recorded his teachings. His response glowingly praises her book as having faithfully followed his methods, and he adds that he recognizes the sketches of his hands on the keyboard.The book is a quality paperback that will take a lot of spreading open at the piano without falling apart. As a student of the Russian Technical Regimen, a method directly derived from Leschetizky's teachings, I found the book to be an excellent supplement. Its 92 pages are crammed full of piano technique, including finger dexterity and independence, timing, use of the metronome, scales, chord playing, arpeggios, embellisments (such as grace notes), use of the pedal, performance tips, suggestions for memorizing, and a lot more, and has either exercises for or examples of each, with sketches of Leschetizky's hands on the keyboard demonstrating hand position for the chords and exercises. The editor offers a few tips that inject just a bit of modern theory.The text was easy to read, the exercises easy to understand and apply, and both are thoroughly enjoyable as well as helpful for the pianist."},{"Title":"The Leschetizky Method: A Guide to Fine and Correct Piano Playing (Dover Books on Music)","review":"This book was actually written not by the famous Leschetizky himself, but by his student Bree, and then later endorsed by the master. In any event, it is solid in the sense that it provides some basic finger exercises that are still useful and presents some basic good advice. The commentary is probably quite correct but generally does not really reveal anything new, neither in content nor in presentation. Perhaps the best part of the book are the illustrations of various hand positions. At the end there is also a perhaps historically interesting article by Paderewski. For finger exercises, I think Hanon is better and more complete, and for a method as such, have a look at Seymour Bernstein's '20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreography'."},{"Title":"The Leschetizky Method: A Guide to Fine and Correct Piano Playing (Dover Books on Music)","review":"This book is full of notations that I think are for advance students in music education or for piano players looking improve their skills. Enlarging the front cover shows the type of notation and fingering that will be found.

The exercises are very boring, and are pretty useless for the beginner. Relatively advanced pianists (Grade 8 and above) will find little in the book. The pictures are of an excellent quality, and are a definite guide, especially the ones about passing the thumb.A more well written book is &quot;Basic Principles in Pianoforte Playing&quot; by Josef Lhevinne (ISBN: 0486228207). This book offers superior advice on improving one's playing, and can be used by all but the most competent pianist."},{"Title":"The Leschetizky Method: A Guide to Fine and Correct Piano Playing (Dover Books on Music)","review":"The pedagogue himself said in this book \\"I have no method\\"...Anyway, this book was NOT prepared by Leschetizky himself. To be exact, neither was it prepared for the pedagogue's students; rather, it was prepared for those students who were not yet ready for lessons by the pedagogue himself.It is more a method as remembered by one of his particular pupils --the pedagogue taught according to the individual need of his pupil-- who later also became one of his mistresses and assistants, to be applied to those intermediates under her only.Few of this padagogue's great pupils, in any, had gone through such \\"method\\" , for most of them were child prodigies themselves. The pedagogue's real method instead concentrated on phrasing, interpretation and musicality and his ability to explore and draw from the potentials of these already great pupils-- as explained by his pupils like Moiseiwitsch and Horszowski.There are however some pictures of hand positions and some finger excercises that are of some value. There are dozens of them showing the \\"correct\\" hand positions for various chords etc (without much elaboration on what effects such hand positions could achieve), presumably they were Lechetizsky's hands. Note that, however, not even Moiseiwitsch played with such curved fingers and that even one of his most favoured pupils Horszowski -- whom he presented as the Mozart of the day, just like he hailed Schnabel as Schubert-- who followed him for 6 years, changed the weight of his arms and hand position in the middle of his career!For an alternative, we can listen directly to his pupils, particularly Ignaz Friedman who later became his assistant, someone the pedagogue himself observed to be technically better than himself. Or even Moiseiwitsch and Horszowski, or perhaps Paderewski. For those who are really interesteed, we still have some fine historic recording of the padagogue on the piano avaiblable which could tell us more than any words by one of his many so-called assistants!"},{"Title":"The Leschetizky Method: A Guide to Fine and Correct Piano Playing (Dover Books on Music)","review":"I'm always suspicious of any book about piano technique, because it isn't something that is easily learned without an experienced teacher at your side. That being said, this book was quite interesting: he starts with the basic mechanics of dropping into the keys and works forward from there. Some of the pictures (black and white) could have been more concise, but overall a great addition to any pianist's library."},{"Title":"The Leschetizky Method: A Guide to Fine and Correct Piano Playing (Dover Books on Music)","review":"This book is useful, but for a much fuller and far more effective treatment of this school of playing, I recommend the \\"Russian Technical Regimen\\" books by Alexander Peskanov, and the companion video, \\"In Search of Sound,\\" which demonstrates the techniques employed. I know the books are available on Amazon but I'm not sure about the video. Classical Video Concepts does handle the video. Peskanov studied in the Ukraine under teachers who were lineal \\"student descendants\\" of Leschetizky. I'd also suggest Googling Peskanov, and becoming familiar with the work of this wonderful concert artist who has a real heart for developing young talent. I've had several opportunities to observe him both performing and working with students in master classes and in private lessons, and he is a genuis with a heart of gold."},{"Title":"Forty steps to Easter;","review":"Msgr.

Still, I wasn't disappointed. The Amish seem to be prone to having large families. I could definitely sympathize with Naomi. I could actually feel the strain she goes through, minding the children and helping at her father's store. I initially disliked her father. He drives her too hard in the begining, looking on her as a slave and being stingy (Why should I hire someone to help when I got Naomi?) and trying to curb her social life. The change he undergoes after the kidnapping and Naomi's departure is a primary example of the \\"Satan schemes; God redeems\\" principle, God using an evil thing like kidnapping to bring about something good in someone's life. I believe that was Brunstetter's goal in writing this, and she has succeeded.I want to be an author myself, though I'm afraid I'm not so Christian and forgiving as the Fischers in this book. I found myself longing for some ironic retribution to overtake the stupid Jim Scott when I finished reading.

Ms. Brunstetter seems to portray all Amish as good, and all English as bad. If you read enough of her books, you'll recognize this pattern.I will say there are as many advantages to being Amish as there is to being English. I would love to be able to cook and quilt and sew as well as they can (well, I can cook, at least, the other I can't do at all), not to mention being able to speak a second language. Though they may not be intellectuals, they are a very industrious people. I have to believe though, that if given the chance, a few of their men and women are brilliant enough to compose classical music or perform surgeries. I, personally, consider it a sin to waste a talent only God can endow an individual with.I do wish Ms. Brunstetter would paint at least one English character in a good light. In \\"A Sister's Secret\\", the news reporter was a jerk, as was the guy who wanted to buy their land, the English grandparents were cruel and jerked Grace's (the Amish heroine's) daughter away from her, then dumped her back off four years later when they could no longer care for her; in \\"Plain and Fancy\\", Laura Meade (an Englischer), was portrayed as Godless and snobby, not to mention her boyfriend back home and college acquaintance.That brings me to this book, where, again, Naomi's English friend Ginny, turns out to be not her friend at all (for once Ginny reunites with her English friend in Portland, she dumps Naomi like a hot potato and expects her to cook for them all the time--I think she just used Naomi so she would have someone to ride with her out there because she didn't have the nerve to drive halfway across the country alone), and then there's Jim and Linda Scott. Jim isn't a bad person, really, but he does do something really bad, and Linda, oh-my-gosh, what a nag! I really don't see how he put up with her. I have never understood this obsession with some people wanting to have a child. It's like they can't be happy (or don't allow themselves to be) unless they have one. It's not a tragedy being childless. A tragedy is when you do have a child and something, well, tragic happens to them. That's a tragedy. It's like people who can't be happy unless they're married. Sure, I would prefer to be married, but if you're not happily single, you won't be happily married.Anyway, that's how this Linda was--never happy. She no sooner had Zach/Jimmy than she wanted another (and she couldn't even handle the one she had!). Just something about that woman sickened me. She really came across as unbalanced.Having a child actually seemed to weaken the Scott's marriage (though all children are a blessing from God, they\`re not always good for a marriage, as I think Jim only wanted to adopt to please his wife). I do think Zach/Jimmy being an illegal adoption put stress on Jim, thus putting stress on their marriage, but I don't think that was all of it. Linda was just a little bit fixated. The woman really grated on my nerves.It's funny, but the secondary romance between Abraham Fisher (Naomi's father) and Fannie Miller was much more interesting and emotional than the one between Naomi and Caleb Hoffmeir. I also think Fannie's daughter, Abby, was a bit over the top in her adoration of her mother. It was actually a bit creepy.I think it would have been harder for Naomi to come home if Ginny had been a nice, quiet girl, who actually showed something positive about being English. It's takes a more skilled author to have a hero or heroine have to choose between two good things, or a good and a better thing, than it is to have them choose between a right choice and a wrong one.Ms. Brunstetter takes a bit long setting the stage before the action starts, but once it starts, I don't want to stop reading. Because of her books, I no longer go by the fifty page rule, meaning if the story doesn't interest me by fifty pages, I put it down.The scene where Naomi comes home was so touching, I actually had tears rolling down my cheeks, and if an author can make me do that, well, she's written a pretty good story. (Now, if only she could make me laugh, too). She just needs to make her heroines (and their loves) a little more interesting."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"I have always been curious about the Amish and the way they live, the simple life. So when I found this book at the Library I had to read it and I couldn't put it down once I started. You can relate to the characters easily ie: Naomi a young 20 yr old Amish girl who promises her dying mother she would care for her siblings and to do this gives up her own love life. Its a touching book.

But, I was really looking forward to getting to the end. This is a wonderful tale of some of the experiences of the Amish. If you're looking for a good Christian fiction, this will definitely delight your senses.I would classify this book as the type you sit on the porch, with some lemonade, and read."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"This is another book right up there with the rest she has written.She realy conveys emotions of her characters so well."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"I have truly been enjoying this series. Ms. Brunstetter makes the characters come alive with thoughts and feelings just like our own, no matter what our situation. She writes from a truly Christian perspective which I found refreshing. I haven't been able to put the books down!"},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"This is the best book that I have read about the amish people that I really enjoyed. You could feel the pain that the family was going through and also the love that they felt for each other by the end of the book. I would recommend this book to all of my family and friends to read."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"Do you enjoy a good love story that keeps you on your toes? If so, anyone of every age would enjoy the captivating book, The Storekeeper's Daughter, written by Wanda E. Brunstetter. She allows you to experience the detailed life of the Amish in a realistic fiction novel. The book includes realistic dialogue and visual imagery. It is obvious that Mrs. Brunstetter knew what she was writing about and makes it fun with all the Amish words she threw in along the way.The author writes with emotion making the reader think everything in life happens for a reason and to make the best of every situation. Naomi is a twenty-year-old woman whose parents own Fisher's General Store. Her family is faced with many hardships that will test their relationships with each other after the mother/wife of the household is killed in a car accident and Zach, the baby, gets kidnapped while Naomi leaves him unattended. Naomi can no longer attend activities that kids her own age are doing, court the man she loves, and is blamed by her family. With being over worked at home and at the store Naomi leaves her family for a new life. While she is gone her father makes a change for the better that includes the whole family. Will Naomi return to a better life? Will her family forgive her? You will be surprised of how things turn out in the end.I enjoyed reading this book so much that I did not want to put it down while reading it in a few days. It was so unique how at different times I felt happy, then sad, followed by mad, making me always wanting to read on to see what happens next. I am sure the next book coming out in the series will be just as interesting. The Storekeeper's Daughter reminds me a lot of the Little House books written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and how hard Laura had to work but not to this extent. Remember everything happens in life for a reason, so make the best of every situation."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"I don't usually read \\"Inspirational\\" romances, preferring the tougher chick-lit genre, but I've always been fascinated by the Amish and thought it would be a nice change of pace. Overall the book was very good, although it did not have the Hollywood happy ending I was hoping for. Maybe it will come in one of the sequels.There was one major problem with the book, however, and because of that, I cannot give the book 5 stars. The dialogue was just awful! I think it was because, from the middle of the book on, we the readers only \\"met up\\" with the characters every few weeks or so. Much of the dialogue between them, then, was wasted giving away what happened when we last left them. It sounded awkward. I won't plagiarize the author by giving a direct quote, but they were like, \\"Oh, we sure had fun in Chicago these past two weeks,\\" or \\"Isn't it wonderful that your daughter has been running the quilt shop for the past six months?\\" Sometimes, there were no other characters in the scene, so someone would be forced to talk to themselves or even a horse!The book has a good plot and likable characters, but I kept wishing that someone would make a movie of this and rewrite some of the lines. Still, most of the book's intended audience of Amishphiles and Christians probably won't be as fussy as I am, and will be swept away by this sweet, clean love story peppered liberally with Bible quotes and words of inspiration. I liked the book, but didn't love it."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"I have only just begun reading Amish-themed romance stories, and I am currently on Wanda Brunstetter's \\"Daughters of Lancaster County\\" series. I just completed reading the first one in the series, \\"The Storekeeper's Daughter\\", and am into the second one, \\"The Quilter's Daughter\\". At first, I thought that this story was too boring and depressing, but I hung in there.(Had I been Naomi, I would have been outta that door a long time ago!) When I finished the first one, I had to read on to the second one because there were too many loose ends from the first, and I wanted to know the outcome! It is good reading, but it doesn't explain any of the Amish traditions or customs as in \\"Plain Perfect\\" by Beth Wiseman.

The one disappointment was that there was no resolution of Zach's kidnapping saga.The book had excellent character development and was well-written. I grew up in rural Montana where there are many Hutterites. And, I have a good friend who is Mennonite, originally from TN. So, I am familiar with some Anabaptist faiths. But, I really enjoyed this book and learned quite a bit. There's a lot of difference between them, though, if this book is correct.This is the first book I read by this author and plan to read more.

It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to take a good story and make the characters (and their words) more believable. I could hardly get into this book...in fact I only made it to page 40 before I gave up. The story drags and the forced dialogue results in characters that seem flat and one-dimensional. People just don't speak to each other in long, drawn-out sentences like this author uses. One character actually refers to her own hair as \\"my dark tresses.\\" Another good example of poor dialogue is the entire conversation that begins on page 28. It never ceases to amaze me how readers can overlook poor writing just because it is a Christian author. I am left feeling disappointed because I had high hopes for this series."},{"Title":"The Storekeeper's Daughter (Daughters of Lancaster County, Book 1)","review":"When picking this book up one day in a store, I had high hopes for it. I have always thought Amish had a fascinating way of life and I figured this book may give me more insight about it. The plot sounded like something I would like.Oh dear, how wrong I was.Firstly, most of the female cast is nothing but teary-eyed, overly sentimental crybabies. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't see anything wrong with any characters crying, but these do it all the time. It's like an Amish soap opra with some of the corniest, cheesiest dialogue ever. The female characters get all emotional over really stupid things. I'll give an example (this is from the second book in the series, The Quilter's Daughter). A daughter is telling her mom how great of a momma she's been to her, and then they both start crying. Ugh, that's the kind of mushiness I just CAN'T take.A lot of the dialogue sounded lifeless and unbelieveable too. It was sugar-coated to the max and didn't sound realistic. Not to mention, the scriptural parts all sounded forced.If you want well-written stories about Amish people, you guys should go with some of the books written by Beverly Lewis.

I understand that in 1995, the Marla Mills phenomenon was new and that Cindy Crawford and Richard Gere were exciting, but with 15 years worth of retrospect I feel that something is missing. Perhaps she should update this with more pertinent illustrations from pop culture.Otherwise, this book has proven invaluable in helping me pick up octogenarians at various functions and projecting the ideal mix of independence and crippling co-dependency that is necessary to make these relationships work.

I've not nearly read all the way through the book yet -- am merely in the process of reading it -- but I'm willing to give a brief review of it based upon my impressions up to this point.The book seems to me to offer a fairly well-balanced and fair treatment of the pros and cons of older men marrying younger women. Upon finishing the book, my views might be altered in some manner or other, but I'd certainly lean toward a positive evaluation of the book at this stage of my reading.\\"Younger Women Older Men\\" would seem to me to be a good read for any younger woman either married to or contemplating marriage to a considerably older man, as well as any older man married to a younger woman. Of course, anyone interested in learning more about human relationships could enjoy and be rewarded by reading Furman's engaging discussions of many thorny and important issues that can arise relatiive to marriage between men who have great chronological seniority over the women in their lives."},{"Title":"Younger Women-Older Men","review":"Furman's book was both captivating and interesting to read. She provided many examples of the personalities of younger women and older men that make them a great pair.

Overall, how issues of power and control are resolved are two of the big issues that can make or break this type of relationship.

For me, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" was more of a one-of-a-kind experience than it was a traditional read. Most of the time I kept thinking what kind of a mind creates this style, this language, this alternate reality? There were times that I thought I almost grasp something but that something quickly evaporated much like a phantom or a hallucination. Though I didn't understand it I can't say that \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is without merit. It has endured too long and has sparked too much debate to be rendered insignificant.

Some people started reading it not knowing what it was and they will continue reading it because this is the book that never ends...&quot; (based on the song the never ends)If you are a person who like to read the ending first please do with this book. Read the ending or at least the last sentence. The book opens with the last half of the sentence that closes the book. Just as I jokingly changed the song lyrics from song to book, this book does not really end. It is a cycle that repeats and does not really have a begin point. Open the book any where at begin.Since it is a book that does not end, I have read the pages twice through, but truely I have never finished reading it.The book has a flow which as printed text stays the same but each reading through is different. It is a simple plot as given in the summeries, but also one of great complex. It is a book to be spoken, not one to read in silence. The way to read this work is to simply hear it. If you do not understand, simply keep listening. As a child I was told, if you do not know a word look it up. In this book, skip the looking up and keep the flow alive. At some point you will enter the flow of the words.The book remind me of the Lord of the Rings. Both authors create an multilayered and deep reality. Both authors like to play with language. LORTR is adventure styled after the sagas of spoken by the winter fires old and creates a myth saga in a dream like world. FW is styled to be spoken by a winter fire and interweaves myth with the conscious and the unconscious struggles of modern life in a dreamlike world. The LORTR is easy to follow, but the reminding ends for FW is not easy to follow. Yet how can flowing struggle of conscious and unconscious be easy to follow?It can be said half joking &quot;that reading FW is like the withdrawl off Paxel or any of its class of drug. You risk part of your sanity as you struggle with the conscious and unconscious flow of life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: Contrary to what some other negative reviewers of Finnegans Wake have done, I make no apologies to those who enjoyed the book for my ensuing critique thereof. I ask for the merit of this review not to be judged by my opinion of the book, but rather by the validity of my case, and its potential helpfulness to those who are interested in reading the book. Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a \\"disappointment\\" would be like calling Bernie Madoff \\"dishonest\\": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading \\"career\\". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, \\"Ulysses,\\" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, \\"Finnegan's Wake,\\" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Okay, folks, this is how you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake. First, you read Shakespeare, preferably Hamlet, start with Cliff's Notes. Then you read the encyclopedia blurb on Vico, the author. Then you read everything you can find on Finnegans Wake in your local half-price book store, and maybe two or three current books on Finnegans Wake from Amazon or one of the big box stores. Then read Joseph Campbell's books on James Joyce and Finnegans Wake. Finally read Harold Bloom's Western Canon. Once you have read those books -- then place Finnegans Wake by your bedside and read a bit every night. Don't start at the beginning. Start anywhere. Harold Bloom will guide you. But read a paragraph or two each session, and then spend about an hour trying to sort out the puns, the historical references, the inside jokes, the psycho-social-sexual history of Joyce, and you will never tire of picking up the Wake again. And that's it. They should never assign Finnegans Wake to high school students. I agree with earlier reviewer: Finnegans Wake is for those who have tired of reading novels. But once you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake you will go back to \\"classic\\" novels and read them with more enjoyment. [Update: having just completed the biography of Lucia Joyce (his daughter) by Carol Loeb Shloss confirms my impression of \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" As Ms Shloss states, \\"FW\\" may be the most remarkable book every written. But I wonder if \\"Ulysses\\" isn't the better of the two with regard to character development, etc?]"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This work is Joyce's finale. It is the logical extension of processes within his work from the earliest writing through Dubliners the Portrait, through Ulysses, and at last 'Finnegan's Wake'. He invents a language of his own , a language of all languages, and expects Mankind to spend ' all the years of the nights' reading it. Aside from his courage, and conviction his great arrogance and literary power this work is the proof of the artist going to the end of what he is with all that he has.And this said in praise- the truth , the basic truth of the unreadibility of the work, of its being rescued for readers by certain lyrical passages, the opening and ending most notably, leaves the work as a secondary one in the Joyce canon. Joyce is Joyce because of Ulysses. Finnegans Wake is the curiosity of his middle old age. The truth is too that the fundamental efforts to make all of history myth, and to find in repetition the answer to our meaning is mistaken historically . And the other great failing is in the punning language itself, the proof positive that in trying to mix up everything into one , one arrives primarily at confusion.Finnegan 's Wake thus stands more as kind of chapter in the literary biography of Joyce than as a literary work of value in itself. And yet how to forget ' riverrun past eve and adam's from bend of bay to swerve of shore' all the way to ' carry me along taddy like ya done at the toy fair a way a lone a last a long the '"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"\\"Finnegans Wake\\" (no apostrophe, kids) is the logical conclusion (\\"It's Phoenix, dear!\\") to Joyce's creative life, the last work of the greatest master of words in any language since Shakespeare. (Admit it!) If you think \\"Ulysses\\" is \\"incomprehensible,\\" then head for the Mystery section at your bookstore. I'd recommend reading a page, tho', to see what all the shouting is about. For me, I knew I couldn't look back, and Joyce has been a blessed thorn in my side for 20 years. Good gosh, what would I do without this man James Joyce, the last heavyweight in the pantheon of godlike writers. ADDENDUM: I just celebrated my 30-year anniversary of my first read of \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" I wish I were younger; so, I'd have more time to spend with it. To the Wake's admirers: are we all a bunch of freaks? Or are we just really turned on by words in general. To the haters: everything in the Wake is there for a purpose, and yes, has meaning. Joyce was the most disciplined writer of all time. And please, folks, he didn't write it to tick you off. Really. (And the edition pictured is NOT the one to purchase; you must buy the edition incorporating all of the author's corrections. Viking Press, I think.) The last italicized word in the Wake is \\"Flood.\\" Just threw that out there. Homer? Took the epic as far as it could go. Shakespeare? The most eloquent writer ever. Joyce? Took words as far as they can go. (Maybe TOO far, judging by all of the 1-star reviews!)"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Okay, this edition of Finnegans Wake may not exactly be dishonest, but it is disingenuous enough to be seriously misleading. Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939. This is true, but it doesn't tell the whole story, and most people have no idea what it really means.Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939. The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them. James Joyce spent the last two years of his life (he died in 1941) going through the text correcting the mistakes. An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition, and the third edition had all of Joyce's corrections incorporated into the text. So the third edition is the definitive one.But Penguin is reprinting the first edition. Get it? The text you'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print. It's smaller, with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover, but it's the text that Joyce approved. I would get that one (it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it), and leave this edition alone."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a novel for people who are tired of reading novels. The chapter summaries in the table of contents, and not the body of the novel itself, give evidence of a plot, which concerns the dream-consciousness of a man whose initials H.C.E. recur as an acronym at various points in the text and whose wife Anna Livia Plurabelle, sons Shem (the Penman) and Shaun (the Postman), and daughter Issy figure prominently among many other exotic and unexpected characters. However, the presentation is so nebulous and abstract that the novel resembles nothing else in literature, although the style looks deceptively easy to imitate.Upon first looking at the pages of &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; one inevitably must wonder what it's supposed to be. My explanation of it is an extension of my theory about &quot;Ulysses,&quot; which is that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was Joyce's effort to write a novel that used every single existing word in the English language, or at least as many as he could. (Among its 400,000 words, &quot;Ulysses&quot; certainly has a much broader lexicon than any other novel of comparable length.) Having exhausted all the possibilities of English in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; he had only one recourse for his next project, which was to create an entirely new language as a pastiche of all the existing ones; the result is &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;The language in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a continuum of puns, portmanteaus, disfigured words, anagrams, and rare scraps of straightforward prose. What Joyce does is exploit the way words look and sound in order to associate them with remote, unrelated ideas. For example, his phrase &quot;Olives, beets, kimmells, dollies&quot; may sound familiar to those who happen to know that the first four letters of the Hebrew alphabet are aleph, bet, gimel, daled. &quot;Psing a psalm of psexpeans, apocryphul of rhyme&quot; recalls a nursery rhyme that may reside quietly in your most dormant memory cells, while &quot;Where it is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of outrager's virtue&quot; sounds like a drunk auditioning for the role of Hamlet. Imaginary adjectives that pertain to letters of the English alphabet are employed to describe Dublin as a city &quot;with a deltic origin and a nuinous end.&quot; &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is the ultimate in esoterica, and what you get out of it depends largely on your store of knowledge, so that upon completion, with a mutual wink at Joyce, you congratulate yourself for being so clever.The text is supposed to reflect a dream or a dreamlike state, an imperfect rendering of hazily remembered pictures and thoughts, but it also evokes the multivocal babble one might hear in a crowded Irish pub, multiple rolling streams of lilting brogue-laden speech combining into a sort of rhythmic cacophony, a variegated procession of verbal images ranging from the mundane to the fantastical. It cannot be read in any conventional manner of reading prose; each sentence has a melody, and the words must be vocalized in the mind to hear the verbal music. It can be maddening if you try to make meaning of it all, but if you're familiar with Joyce's past work, you've already risked your sanity adequately to make it through &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"To answer a few points made by other reviewers:1) Yes, some people have finished this book. I have, and so have several people I know.2) Some people enjoy this book. (see above).3) It isn't just self-indulgence by academics. For example: a Professor of English Literature at Oxford University has said that it's not worth reading. Lots of academics have. These are people who 'know everything' for a job. Can you imagine how much FW annoys them?4) It's hard. Yes, that's right, hard. But hard can be fun. Just like sex. (FW does take longer though).5) The reason why lovers of Joyce sound so passionate about it is that they genuinely feel that way. For real. Imagine you'd fallen in love and noone around you had a clue what it felt like. You'd want to shake them and tell them.6) It makes sense. To fully understand it (if that's possible) would take generations of study. But i) If you're reading for pleasure, not ego kicks, surely how much you get out matters more than what proportion of the book's meaning you can lay claim to, ii) like life, reading FW is made up of lots of small pleasures and ii) Lighten up!! It's funny! Anyway, when was the last time you 'fully' understood a book?It's easy to see why the great majority of people would decide that they had other priorities. I respect that opinion. But please don't fling insults at a book that some of us love. Yes, love. Reading FW was a high-point of my life. Emotion and excitement: anger, frustration, joy, humour, delight, even boredom. Deep relationships are difficult. They hurt. And they make us more alive."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Call me crazy, but I almost never stop reading a book I started. Sometimes I'm sorry I didn't give it up at first, but other times (e.g., &quot;Moby Dick&quot;) I'm not.It took me five years to read finnegan's wake, on and off. It is probably the hardest book to read in the English language (I won't go into Joyce's use of German, French, Latin, Hebrew, etc.)But why is it worth it? What makes Finnegan's wake different from utter nonsense? A LOT. Many readers complain that they can only understand two or three points every page. True for me as well. But when I checked, the obscure points of the seemingly meaningless sentences *always* had some deeper meaning.For example, let us start with the title: &quot;Finnegans wake&quot; (the apostrophe that appears in many editions is a mistake.) There is at least a triple meaning: &quot;Finnegan's wake&quot;, the wake of the mystical hero; &quot;finnegans wake&quot; - the Irish are waking up; and &quot;fin-again wake&quot; - showing the cyclical nature of the dream history of this book.Or take the year, 1132, that appears in the book quite a lot (sometimes in the guise of 566, which is 1132/2). It symbolizes the the circularity of history (11=10+1, starting to count again after reaching 10) and the fall of empires (bodies fall at 32 ft/sec^2).Or take the case of the dreamer's son, who falls from the sky as &quot;a bare godkin&quot;. It is both a description of his condition (a naked son of God) and a pun on Hamlet's &quot;a bare bodkin&quot; (an unsheated dagger.)These are just three examples. But this is where Joyce's genius is - and the enjoyment of the book is. It's just plain fun to figure these things out - and when you *do* figure them out, the real meaning of the text, and the story, begins to show.It's hard work, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I've just reached the end ... or is it the beginning? It's taken me six months, with Anthony Burgess' 'Here Comes Everybody' providing a basic and unsatisfactory commentary on this nightmare of a book. I can't really recommend anybody to read this unless you know exactly what you're letting yourself in for ... unlike Ulysses, which I believe everybody should attempt at some point in their lives. So why have I given it 5 stars? Because it simply had to be written.Without the Wake, twentieth century fiction would have been simply an extension of the nineteenth century. This book is what sets us apart. Don't believe the people who tell you it's a joke - a genius like Joyce doesn't spend 15 years, resign himself to penury when a \\"Ulysses Lite\\" could have made him a rich man, and ultimately ruin his eyesight all for nothing more than the literary equivalent of a whoopee cushion. There are deep things here, it's just that they're buried so deep that it's mostly not worth the effort of mining them. But again, I've given it 5 stars because this book is like a nail bomb in a library (shhhhh!) - it destroyed everyone's perception of what could ever constitute literature. If the Wake can be created, anything is possible. The Wake gave the green light to everyone's wildest imaginings and bizarre method of telling it - after all, whatever you write it won't be as difficult or as slow or as mad or as painful as this work.Don't let anybody tell you that there is an easy way into this book. Whichever way you approach it, however many primers and explanations you read, nothing will prepare you for 650 pages of dense dream-imagery written in polyglottal puns through which you grasp at anything that makes the slightest sense (and I mean slightest). The basic story of a publican dreaming over the repercussions of being caught urinating in a public park by two soldiers and then being accused of indecent exposure is by the by and of little import, because it is so thoroughly buried beneath hundreds of layers of Irish, oedipal and religious history, myth and gossip and the minutiae of everyday life transfigured by dream, that it would be easy to miss (and if you did, it wouldn't be a problem anyway - this is hardly narrative-driven). There are moments of comedy, but they're few and far between. The publican becomes the man-myth-mountain Finnegan, who represents Ireland, his forgiving and defending wife becomes Anna Livia Plurabella, the river Liffy and mother nature herself - reading the book is a battle that's impossible to win and you ultimately simply surrender yourself to the flow, the cycle of life which, like water taken from the sea to clouds to rain to rivers to sea to clouds .... takes you from the end to flow back to the beginning without even a full stop to halt things. I wondered whether it would make more sense the second time round, then decided that I didn't really care to find out.So, be glad that you don't have to read this book, but you should all definitely celebrate that it was written."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I have been reading some of the positive and negative reviews of Finnegans Wake, and decided to post my own thoughts.I think of Finnegans Wake as an experiment. It's really up to the reader to decide whether it is a successful experiment or not.I kind of like it, but it probably wouldn't be a book I would take with me if I was going to be marooned on a desert island and could only take a few books with me. On the other hand, maybe I would, because it is a book that the more time you put into it the more it gives back. So if I was going to be on the island for a LONG time, Finnegans Wake would be a good choice.Some folks have been saying there is no plot or characters. Well, yes there is. The main character is a fellow named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, HCE for short. He is a bar-owner in Dublin, Ireland. His wife is Anna Livia Plurabelle, ALP. They have two sons, usually called Shaun and Shem (short for Seamus), and a daughter named Issy. Also at the bar work an old woman named Kate and an old man named Sackerson. Other characters are the customers at the bar and schoolgirls who are friends of Issy.The main plot concerns rumours that circulate about an incident involving HCE. These rumours are very vague, but they usually seem to be accusing HCE of some sort of sexual misbehavior in the park.But Joyce has written the novel so that it can be read on many levels. HCE and his family stand for every human family, and for all of humanity. The rivalry between Shaun and Shem stand for all sorts of struggles between man and his \\"brother man\\". The two of them together come into conflict with HCE in a basic Oedipal struggle. HCE comes to stand for every person accused (rightly or wrongly) of misdoing. The whole thing is structured as a pattern that repeats itself over and over, from generation to generation, in families and whole nations, throughout history. Each generation takes the place of the previous one, and then in turn has its place taken by the next. Joyce symbolizes this by beginning the book with the end of a sentence that begins on the last page, making the whole book a circle with no real beginning or end.In order that the book can exist on so many levels at once, Joyce uses the peculiar Finnegans Wake language. The words of this language are each able to mean two or more things at once. So any given sentence or section will mean one thing on the level of the story of HCE and his family, but will mean all kinds of different things on all the different levels that Finnegans Wake exists on.Looking at just the first sentence:\\"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.\\"So he is saying that he is now circling back from the end of the book back to the beginning.On one level, he is talking about the river Liffey, a river in Dublin which does almost go in a circle, but starts near Howth Castle and runs past a church called Adam and Eve's.He is also talking about the historical theories of Giambattista Vico (hence the word \\"vicus\\") who saw history as going in circular patterns that constantly recurred.And Joyce realizes we could call this a \\"vicious circle\\".When he says \\"Howth Castle and Environs\\" he incorporates the initials of his protagonist HCE, which is where he is going to start. (note that Joyce capitalizes the H, C, and E.)He has also cicled back to the beginning of humanity, with Adam and Eve. (On a certain level, HCE and ALP stand for Adam and Eve. Think of how Adam was thrown out of a garden for committing a sin)And the one sentence, or selected words from the sentence, can mean even more different things. The opening word sounds like the french for \\"Let us dream\\", and Joyce described all of Finnegans Wake as a dream.The point is that this one sentence means all these things, and more, all at the same time. And these are the kind of word-games that Joyce plays with us for 628 pages. It doesn't get any easier, it stays like this for the whole book. To play the game well, you need to try to think the way Joyce did. It often helps to read the words out loud, with an Irish accent (like Joyce had). (Parenthetically, when I personally read a book, or anything else, I can \\"hear\\" the words in my mind. My understanding is that there are at least some people who when they read do not \\"hear\\" the words they are seeing. Finnegans Wake really requires the reader to \\"hear\\" the words, so if you have trouble with this try reading the book out loud.)I guess the problem is that many people find these sorts of word games very difficult. Also, Joyce doesn't tell us the rules of the game. (There is one chapter where it looks like Joyce is about to tell us the rules, but then he doesn't) Many scholars have written excellent books about Finnegans Wake and their personal understanding of the rules of Joyce's game, and also the parts they believe they have \\"solved\\". But with Finnegans Wake, there always seem to be more levels of meaning that can be explored.So if you enjoy these sorts of word games, you will enjoy Finnegans Wake. If you don't, then you won't. And you may not be able to tell the difference between Finnegans Wake and random gibberish, such as a computer generates. But this is not random gibberish, Joyce is really telling the story of humanity through this one Dublin family. If you know how to play the game, you will be able to find the characters and themes. I would recommend that someone coming to the book for the first time should get a hold of one of the books that gives some idea of how to \\"play the game\\".There are a lot of people all over the world who enjoy playing the Finnegans Wake game. But if this is not your thing, that's okay."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"James Joyce's last novel, and incidentally the one his wife considered his best, is, as they say, unreadable, in that if you sit down and go through the book from cover to cover (as I have done) you'll only get the vaguest idea of what was going on. So if that's your idea of the all-time downer reading experience then spend your money on something else, because this is one of those books that is liable not only to change the way you look at life, but the way you read and think. Joyce called it a night book - the &quot;action&quot;, such as there is any (and the action comprises pretty much all of human history and civilisation) takes place while the characters (a Dublin pub owner, his wife and family and sundry other unsavoury types) are asleep. But you'd never know that if I hadn't told you, because the language is a punster's dream (literally), a braided and twisted weave of most of the various tongues in the world, based on an idea by the English language, all to be spoken with a fairly strong Irish accent. (Non-Irish people often don't notice this, but the rest of us can hear it.) It's not a book to while away a plane trip. It's a book to spend a few dollars on and then spend the rest of your life dipping in and out of it for profit and pleasure. Some of it is pretty straightforward, such as the visit to the Willingdone museyroom or the episode about the chicken scratching around in the rubbish heap (a lot more gripping than it sounds), while other bits are maddeningly opaque. But if they read novels in heaven they probably read this one. The best way to get the most out of it is to have read every book ever written, but failing that, an open mind, an active imagination, and a sensitivity to the buried layers of meaning in words will get you through. Frank Zappa fans ought to love it; this is conceptual continuity with a vengeance. (Wow. I never thought the day would come when I'd get to review a novel by James Joyce.)"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Have I read the Wake? Yes. Did I understand the Wake? No. Was I threatened by my lack of understanding? No. Did I feel intimidated by its author? A little. Did I feel insulted owing to that intimidation? Not at all. Quite the contrary.

Absolutely. Would I read it again? Yes, I would. Is it the greatest novel every written? Who's to say? Is it the worst? No, decidedly not. What is it then? Words on a page. Sentences. Their syntax. Their rhythm and cadence, euphony and flow. Is it anything more? Doubtless. What is that more? More than I can say."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher \\"Finnegans Wake\\" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.I first tried reading \\"Finnegans Wake\\" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" by Dumas, \\"Les Miserables\\" by Hugo, \\"War and Peace\\" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, \\"Notes From the Underground,\\" \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. \\"Growth of the Soil\\", by Knut Hamsun, and \\"The Master and Margarita,\\" by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over \\"Finnegans Wake\\" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as \\"Finnegans Wake\\" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Imagine you're in a pub in Dublin, and a regular has started talking to you. The combined amount of beer in both of you makes it difficult to understand much of what he's saying, but every once in a while there's a moment of clarity where you get it. You laugh not only at what's said but at yourself for the situation you're in. In the meantime you can only stare gape-mouthed at the beauty of the sounds he makes and in hopes that another moment of clarity is near.It is easy to get frustrated with this book if you can't get comfortable with its style."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OK, so, yes, some sort of very sophisticated intelligence was involved in this work. No doubt the allusions, multi-lingual puns, and invented words that fill over 600 pages were carefully chosen. But as a whole, or even in small parts, it doesn't make any sense and doesn't yield even to careful analysis and background research.There is no plot, it explains nothing, and it describes nothing coherently. If the goal was to capture the confused, disorganized dream state of a polygot Irish writer then, yes, it's all there on paper. But was an entire book needed for this?The hubris of this undertaking -- and of the literary critics who saved it from obscurity -- can be seen in the condescending introduction to this Penguin edition, where the editor writes:&quot;...any reader can enter Finnegans Wake and find something to absorb him -- as long as he or she doesn't expect to find it all in one place or, complementarily, understand everything else that appears around it. It is even possible to argue, with this same logic, that Finnegans Wake may be more accessible to the common reader that Ulysses -- or, for that matter, War and Peace or Remembrance of Things Past -- since one doesn't have to comprehend it as a totality to profit from it or enjoy it.&quot;In other words, unlike those other books where we read about people, ideas, history, etc. here we can just enjoy the sound and look of random phrases and sentences, the way a baby enjoys pleasant sounding nonsense.The introduction goes on to say, &quot;It can sometimes seem that one is doing well if one makes sense of only a sentence or two on a single page. If, however, one surrenders the need to be master of everything -- or even most things -- in this strange and magnificent book, it will pour forth lots of rewards.&quot;I humbly disagree -- one or two identfiable bits of prose per page is almost by definition an unsatisfactory reading experience. And the estimate of one to sentences per page is high -- after a paragraph or two of incomprehensible invented words, even a few straightforward words or sentences have no context or meaning.I wouldn't discourage people from buying this book, just to see for themselves how weird it is. But I wouldn't say its a good book, anymore than the scholarly yet demented ravings and ramblings of a schizophrenic former PhD student on a streetcorner constitute good oratory. Fascinating, but more worthy of medical and psychiatric scrutiny than literary study."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegan's Wake is a book apart from others. It does not succeed because of great characterisation, fascinating plot, or for any of the usual criteria with which we generally judge literature. Rather, it succeeds because of the purity of Joyce's vision; this is not a cultural purity -- in fact, it is quite the reverse -- it is instead an artistic one. Comparable to the visual techniques of Tanguy and Kandinsky, or to the musical techniques of LaMonte Young, it functions way beyond the dynamics of conventional art. It is, to grant it proper appreciation, impenetrable through normal eyes; hence, the polarisation of the reviews on this page.Here, finally, is what Joyce was building to over the course of his writing (following 'A Portrait...' and 'Ulysses'). He reached a point of transcendence, where he was no longer constrained by, among other things, conventional grammar, or the use of a single language at a time. Where everyday language is clumsy compared to, say, musical expression, the voice of 'Finnegan's Wake' is liquid -- and this is something that no other writer achieved to the same degree.It is infinitely subtle, each word functioning as its own microcosm, but also operating as part of the grand design of the book. Particularly, this characterises the eloquent divergence of the 'final' pages. The book is concise: it is perfect. It is, in this sense, a 'pure' work of art, something to be studied and admired for its ingenious beauty, rather than read casually on the toilet.And, sixty years later, mankind has yet to fashion a more coherent and complete literary vision."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Into the gobbledeegook go slipper the whipper and the trimtrammaduhdeedo, believing the glubbledubble spewed forth by a madman.What do you think, am I a genius or what? Just send me twenty bucks and I'll send you the next 600 pages.Here are three words for Joyce that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy mave have been great at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since Joyce was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: &quot;No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.&quot; True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Joyce, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a once eloquent and insightful wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot. It's a shame, really.And to all those stuffy professors who like to belittle the layperson by pretending to understand this book, I offer this lucid reproval: ooglebagoogle you jimmenyjammeroos. Take that, Mr. Wisemen."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Should you buy James Joyce's Finnegans Wake? Three reasons for getting to yes, she said, yes, yes, yes.1: An incredible value. You probably will be reading it delightedly if it is at all your cuppa, for at least the next forty years and at about $7, that's a bargain. Other books may be one-night gulps; this, like Shakespeare, will be pleasure and a joy as long as you can read. One can hardly better the per-word, per-page, per-year return on a $7 investment.Or at least, so suggests Nobel physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who tells us he named the subatomic entity he discovered as he was \\"again perusing \\"Finnegans Wake\\" and happened on the section which included the poemlet beginning, \\"Three quarks for Muster Mark.\\" Joyce might have been delighted to know that uniquely among subatomic entities, quarks come in flavors: up, down, top, bottom, charmed, and strange.2. Like \\"Ulysses,\\" which it closely resembles, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is affirmative, gloriously, magnificently, strangely, honorably affirmative. Both books echo enduring, complex mythic figures----the Greek/Homeric Odysseus the man of many guises, the wanderer, and the Irish warrior, Finn McCool, who sleeps beneath a faery hill to waken again in Ireland's time of need. Both deeply reflect cycles: Ulysses, the cycle of a day (June 16th) and Finnegans Wake, night, sleep, the cycles of life itself and of the great rivers of place, space, and time. Both center, more or less, on the consciousness/unconsciousness of a single character---Bloom in Ulysses and Humphrey Chimpdon Earwicker (HCE) in the Wake. Both begin with sexuality (plump stately Buck Mulligan in Ulysses who is buck naked in the first sentence and the great river Liffey flowing past Eve and Adams in the Wake.) And both---oh the joy of reading this aloud, end in long soliloquies by women: Molly Bloom's glorious cascade ending in yes, she said, yes, yes, yes and Anna Livia Pluribell's glorious call to the land, its people, and her spouse--comatose? sleeping?---to arise, awake, renew, begin again, wake again, Finnegan in The Wake.Achieving such affirmation seems an almost unbelievable stance at the end of Joyce's difficult life---almost blind, poor, his daughter insane, 20 years spent in writing the Wake--and it is not an affirmation glibly reached. Night, dreams (whose we don't sknow for sure, perhaps many dreamers), and in that sleep of almost death what dreams may come? One wants to stand to read the last section, like at the Hallelujah chorus.3. The sheer magnificence, creativity, erudition, knowledge of the language; the playfulness like Lewis Carroll unshackled; the flow of thought, ideas, layerings. The flamboyance of langguage, all flags flying, all sails set.If you delight in crossword puzzles, if you like reading Jabberwocky in as many languages as you can, if you think Hofstader's The Eternal Golden Braid a delight, and are not among those to whom A. E.Housman says, Ale, boys, that's the thing to drink for people whom it hurts to think\\"---you will find almost unlimited puzzlement and joy in every page.Take---as an example, even that first reference to Eve and Adams. Well it was an actual pub situated near the ocean end of the Liffey; its' name suggests the Fall of Man with Eve as the instigator who, as Milton writes contributes in the end to our redemption. This first sentence about the river flowing in a commodius viscus around Howth Castle & Environs (it does) suggests too the publican (barkeep) whose initials are named in this first sentence, HCE, and who may represent the legendary Irish policeman, Here Comes Everyone. And the sentence begins in its middle, the start arriving many pages later, at the very end----only it isn't an end, but a cycle, a continuation.Getting if need be to no. There are a few reasons NOT to buy this book. We are--or at least I am--more accustomed to novels telling stories be they happy or sad, complex or simple. This one tells many stories in fragments and complexes interweaving not only the story of the warrior Finn but also the Irish ballad, Finnegan's Wake, in which again in the Fall of Man, the tippling (and tipping) hod-carrier Tim Finnegan tumbles off a ladder, appears dead, is wildlythe waked, and revived when whiskey gets tossed on the apparent corpse. So one can get bored or exhausted by just a sentence. Impatient. One can feel too ignorant to understand even a little since Joyce wanders among Sanskrit, Greek, French, German, Old Icelandic languages as well as local sayings, great and more obscure literature. Enough already, one can feel.None-the-less, if Murray Gell-Mann returns like Finnegans over and over and over, well, perhaps so can we. And have fun-again discovering those three quarks (quarts? seagull cries?) ourselves.Oh: which edition? This one uses the original as published. One of my other copies uses the edition Joyce corrected himself over two years. Both are wonders, but this one is about $30 cheaper at present."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"You will probably consider this novel to be difficult. I agree with anybody who thinks so. It is very difficult. It certainly is hard to grasp, but once you get into it, that is it. James Joyce stretched the language and brought the book to a far higher form of writing that is uncommon around. Uncommon in the sense that you have to get into it to love it. Like Disciples of Fortune, this is a very compelling story with vivid descriptions, a varied and rich setting and peculiar characters. The pacing, characterization and the flow of the story are well observed. Overall, this is a well-crafted story."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It takes patience and a great deal of time to work through Joyce's experimental style, but is well worth the effort. \\"[Joyce wrote Finnegans Wake in Paris over a period of seventeen years, and published it in 1939, two years before his death, Finnegans Wake was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which many critics believe attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. Owing to the work's expansive linguistic experiments, stream of consciousness writing style, literary allusions, free dream associations, and its abandonment of the conventions of plot and character construction, Finnegans Wake remains largely unread by the general public.]\\"Finnegans Wake inspired me to create a children's book on life, loss, and the space between. It can be found on Amazon.com as well as at paperbackswap[dot]com.If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake and have children you might take a look at it. It's been called, \\"An extremely creative collection of stories where the reader plays an active role in the outcome.

Very enjoyable.\\""},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"If you like larger print, get this version, the Penguin one.If you like accuracy with Joyce's alterations and corrections, get the Faber and Faber one, black cover with red type:Finnegans Wake"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I like to keep this book around to impress people.You know how Joyce's Ulysses shows up on those best of all time lists, but you secretly haven't read that book and suspect that no one else has talked about that day's journey in the Hibernian Metropolis?This one is like that but worse. You can't even rightly say what it is about (many will disagree). It is deep to the point of deliberate obtuseness, a work Twenty years in the making that was so mythical that halfway through it Joyce's peers wrote a book about this book, \\"Our Examination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress\\".It can blow you away and bore you. It can make you want to visit Zurich to stop buy his grave and ask the same question Joyce asks on his death bed, \\"Does nobody understand?\\" Most who read this won't. And you know what? That's just fine."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"As I'm sure many have discovered, it's imperative (if a near prerequisite) that anyone wishing to appreciate \\"Finnegans Wake\\" acquire of copy of Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key. One could theoretically go it alone, or certainly use the many other companion pieces and interpretations that have appeared over the decades, but not only is Campbell's by and large the \\"original\\" Rosetta Stone for this tome, it's also, at least to me, the most intellectually and spiritually fulfilling.Of course, as the saying goes, ask someone to interpret a passage of the Wake and that will tell you a lot about that person. So I don't pretend that Campbell's analysis or my own is correct. Rather, I feel it's a good rebuttal to the cynically prevalent question of \\"Is it worth my time?\\", for which the asker usually has their own answer of \\"No!\\" at the immediate ready.The Wake is Joyce's attempt to put the Universe in print, to squeeze Life, with all its yins and yangs, between two covers. It is an exhaustive and noble effort; \\"ambitious\\" proves too thin a word for the scope of, well, his ambitions. Quite honestly, many elements mesh when viewed through a pantheistic prism. Finnegan's fall from the ladder at the beginning is essentially the fall of Adam, or, rather, to put it more positively, the transformation of the \\"God\\" figure from a high state of paradise to the ruggedness of the physical world (the idea being that, always perfect, God/Cosmos couldn't know perfection until it had experienced the other polarity - one can't know hot without cold, etc.). Soon after, Finnegan is replaced by the character HCE (one meaning of which is \\"Here Comes Everyone\\"), who creates multiple families (just as humans have created multiple societies), and is swept up in violence and scandal.This barely scrapes the surface of the Wake's vastness. It is also drawn from over sixty languages, cycles back on itself much as seasons (and the Universe, as projected by the Big Crunch theory), and some have even spotted patterns of DNA structure in its pages.Just as the world is a three-dimensional Rorscharch test, seen differently by every set of eyes, understood differently by every mind, so too is the Wake a glorious experience in subjectivity. Life in print. And for this if nothing else, Joyce as an imaginative artist deserves significant accolades."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"this is a solid version of Finnegan's Wake because it embodies all of the corrections made by Joyce himself after publishing the original version.

And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, &quot;As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die.&quot; Joyce himself said something to the effect of: &quot;The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever.&quot; John Lennon said, &quot;All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not.&quot; And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the &quot;truth&quot; of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"First of all, if you really need to see the story about as completely as you can understand in your concrete world:This is the story of a brilliant man laying down, going to sleep, entering the universal common consciousness, and then beginning to wake up again. To know this book, learn to sleep. GO to bed when the sun goes down. Turn off the Television and the ipod when you sleep and maybe after 25 years you might get to realize this as well.If you must follow some traditional narrative thread, get the Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake and you will get some idea as to what is going on, but miss three quarters of the fun. It'd be like reading the script of Star Wars to see what happened in that movie (only Finnegans is a much better script). Joseph Campbell has done us literal literate readers, who have learned to see no more than what is in front of our eyes in a simple logical progression, a great service in spelling out, read his lips, exactly what is going on at all times.But what is going on is that vast consciousness we may enter when we enter deepest sleep, beyond words, where everything interconnects.Several other commentaries are as useful and more interesting. THe Skeleton Key, as is implied, lays out the bare bones of the narrative part by part. Others explore different motifs, such as heraldry or children's stories, or other languages, etc.You can find commentaries such as Joyce and the Jews which traces a Talmudic structure throughout the Wake and a Hebraic origin to its use of each letter as signifier, including the Cabalistic curious numerical value of ALP, the female essence of the dreamland. You can find other commentaries which discover Sherlock Holmes lurking beyond each passageway.Each element in Finnegans Wake is not random, but intentional, a tribute to the genius and all-inclusive learning of Mr. Joyce. Like the great cathedrals of Europe, at Chartres, etc., it is far beyond our dumbed-down televised understanding. Just as it is now impossible for us to rebuild the Cathedral at Chartres (the rose window alone could never be reconstructed) so do we find the construction of Finnegans incomprehensible without every aid available.We find our exiled selves now so unfortunately devolved literally as to be no longer capable of comprehension, but only dismissal. It makes our heads hurt to think, to laugh, to expand.Finnegans is a great mountain beyond our vision, beyond the clouds, too wide and too tall to see, but one we do well to climb attentively, to broaden our own perceptions, our horizons, our fitness, our minds, our souls.Get it. Get the commentaries, beginning with Joseph Campbell, but soon you will see his own limitations and struggle to go beyond him. His Skeleton Key is like the Finnegans Wake for Dummies series. Go beyond your own limitations, farther than you thought possible, and be proud of each one of your tiptoed small achievements in reading this book, pursuing every avenue of investigation. Read it. Sleep on it. Read some more. Until you too begin to awaken."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I really enjoy obscure references and allusions. I love that feeling of being in on something. It's nice to discover those little goodies that everyone else glosses over. Clever puns and whatnot are great, but they are no substitute for a good story, strong characters, and so on. Finnegans Wake has nothing going for it. (While it does have puns, they are anything but clever). When you read a good book it should have an effect on you. You should lose sleep turning it over in your mind. Finnegans Wake sort of makes you think in that you have to try to figure out what this word is, or what language this might be, or what Joyce was smoking when he wrote this schlock. What it doesn't do, however, is make you laugh, cry, gasp, grimace, or reminisce like true literature does.Questions for all those that gave this 5 stars: Did you really enjoy reading this? Did it elicit any sort of emotional response out of you? At best it will make you feel smart for recognizing a few foreign words.Honestly, I think Joyce was just a polyglot wordsmith and wrote this as a sort of mental exercise for the same reason people do Sudoku puzzles. But that doesn't mean others should read it, and it certainly doesn't mean it belongs in the canon of English classics."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page.

Well, not much unless one is willing to spend a great deal of time atempting to decipher speakers from observations. However, what I can say is that this is probably the greatest work ever written. Note that I do not say I love this book or that it is my favorite book. This book is not for enjoyment, this book is meant to be thought about and even cause confusion.

I believe the format we chose helped tremendously; we had nine strong, informed readers who each read the same passage and gathered once a week to discuss it. Reading in groups, I think, is the only way to begin to grasp the Wake; everyone brings their own idiosyncratic knowledge to the table, and can shed light on passages that would otherwise remain obscured. I believe the Wake is uniquely built in a way to reward group studies. It seems all of history is in these pages, and discussing it with some wise colleagues is the best way to unpack it all.

I don't know why people are so quick to dismiss this land mark. If you don't understand the language fine, I don't understand most of the words, but Joyce did say to understand this book to read out loud, and with an Irish accent. I did this, and it was much simpler for me to read the story. Another thing you have to think of are circles, every paragraph tells basicly the same story except in a different way with different sounds. And with that comes a structured whole. For all you people that hate learning things, I would stir clear of this, or you may end up having your mind exband to new harizons."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"... Yes, this book is hard to understand and read. That's where its beauty lies. For me, it's a pleasure to read it. Although the story's wiven through the book, you can follow it hardly. But for me, the story is not what the book's about. The book is just a great series of great sounds, wordplays and everything and it is in it's form as great as any other piece of abstract art. Because that's what it is. Abstract art. We have abstract paintings (do I have to name examples?), abstract music, so why can't we have abstract literature? I think it's very interesting to read this and give your own meaning to it, as you (might) do with abstract paintings and/or music. In that way it's a great effort of James Joyce, since you can give anything your own meaning: music, paintings... except for books. Books are beautiful but at the same time there are unwritten rules for books: a storyline, grammar... I could go on for hours. James Joyce breaks with this tradition. But that's great! It has been done before in every form of art! Look at the way music evolved: from classical music all the way to grindcore. There's such a big difference between all those. Music can be simple, and difficult, and I dunno how to explain it. It's just not so rule-based as literature. And therefore, once again, we should cherish this piece of art. It's groundbreaking. Can't say anything to that."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I actually managed to read FW cover to cover. From what I gathered, Joyce was trying to intersperse life, death and rebirth into a mythical Irish epic. With it's obscure references, jabberwocky-like sentences and chaotic theme, he has a lot of fun keeping the reader guessing. His chief talent here is playing with words, puns, and puzzles all while trying to tell an obscure tale with no obvious plot.

A father and his daughter uncover themselves in a Garden of Eden park setting. Their exploration is spied upon by four evangelists. Their names are Matthew Mark Luke and John.A hard novel to read? Finnegan's Wake is my brain's favorite jungle gym. Absolutely the hardest read there is, even when compared to Joyce's novel Ulysses.

It's a cryptic compendium of games, puzzles, riddles, and songs.But for those of you too daunted by the challenge of reading Joyce's final masterwork, there's always the consolation of complaining about your shortcomings on the internet. Please follow these rules when posting your hatchet-job reviews of Finnegans Wake, to make sure you don't deviate from the list of tired tropes churned out by every negative reviewer in the seventy years since the Wake's publication.1) Make it plain that you didn't finish the book. Describe in excruciating detail the amount of times you tried to read it, and the circumstances surrounding your decision to stop in each instance. Remember, literature is all about you.2) Be sure you call it \\"gibberish\\" or \\"drivel,\\" so that everyone realizes your humble dedication to experiencing this work of literature and your respect for the talent and hard work of its author. In order to demonstrate that you have the attention to detail necessary for the task of reading the Wake, misspell the title frequently.3) Show what an original thinker you are by considering that Joyce wrote Finnegans Wake as a colossal joke, or to punish his admirers for whatever reason. Make it seem like you are literally the first person in history to make this observation.4) Deride Joyce for having the arrogance and presumption to be more intelligent and well-read than you. Remember, it's not that you have an inferiority complex or anything. It's important that Joyce be called out as an insensitive literary snob. Every negative review of the Wake has to contain the sentence, \\"The Emperor has no clothes.\\"5) Revile Joyce's admirers as academic phonies who only claim to have read Finnegans Wake so they can lord it over everyone else. Pat yourself on the back for your maverick integrity while you're actually expressing the overwhelming majority opinion on the book. You can also credit Joyce with creating an entire edifice of pseudo-intellectual postmodern dogma that infests literary criticism to this day, but remember, this has to be done with a straight face and no subtlety whatsoever.6) For advanced haters only. Come up with an oh-so-droll Reading Challenge that will expose professed lovers of the Wake as the frauds they are. Propose, for example, that readers try to tell the difference between a passage of the Wake and the product of a random word generator.

The ideas expressed are contrived and uninteresting, and many have been already been treated, better, in Ulysses. \\"But how do you get past the language?\\" is the rejoinder I'm expecting to hear. It's true that very few people understand every word in the book. However I refuse to suscribe to the school of thought that states that FW is a great book just because its hard to understand and nobody will ever \\"get\\" all of it. Some people have come pretty close- MacHugh's \\"Annotations\\" goes a long way with individual words, and Campbell's \\"Skeleton Key\\" well give you the overarching meaning (yes, there is meaning) if you read it with a critical eye. These two books pretty much have FW cracked, end of story.Now many people will also argue that one shouldn't read FW for the meanings or ideas, like other books, but rather that simply the sweet sounds of the language are enough to give it value as a literary object- essentially, even if we don't understand a word, it sounds nice. This is just silly. If you want an auditory experience listen to music or the sounds of nature. If euphonious words is your thing, read some poetry. But for heavens' sakes don't spend the time required to read 680 pages of garbled words simply because they sound cool. My point is that there are already artistic and, in my view, far more enjoyable ways to go about getting a cathartic auditory experience. FW has neither the mellifluosity of The Raven or a Spenserian sonnet, nor obviously can it provide the sonic intensity of a symphony. Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.The style of FW is idiotic. It was a nice idea at the time, sure, and probably it had to be done when considering the progress of literature as a whole, but these points don't mean that the style is of any aesthetic worth. Most of the words are incomprehensible without some guide, like the \\"Annotations.\\" Because the difficulty is at the level of words, rather than ideas, one doesn't read FW, one translates it. Joyce uses foreign words (from 60 languages!) and perversions of English as the basis for the vocabulary of the text, and combines and arranges these as he pleases. Now I don't mind foreign language quotes in my books, and I'm as big of a fan of witty word-play as anyone, but when you're essentially inventing a language arbitrarily as you go along you've made a huge and pointless mistake. Why stop at the level of words? Why not write using a whole new alphabet? And the kicker is that the many of the puns are incredibly POINTLESS! A \\"bad of winds,\\" for example- \\"bad\\" is Persian for \\"wind,\\" apparently. So this means what, a \\"wind of winds\\"? Come on, this is lame! and a far cry from true wit. In another \\"celebrated\\" passage, Joyce weaves the names of a bunch of rivers into a conversation between two washerwomen. I.e., \\"kennet,\\" meaning \\"ken it\\" or \\"know it\\", and the Kennet river in England. But what's the point? That rivers are cool? That Joyce is cool because he looked up a bunch of river names? That we're cool for figuring them out? Such puerile and mechanical displays of erudition are a waste of time for everyone involved.The common response to attacks on FW's style is that Joyce was attempting to convey the nebulous and polysemous state of dreams. If so he failed miserably. I don't know about the rest of you but I don't dream in portmanteau words- when people talk I know exactly what they're saying. We may not understand why particular things happen in dreams, but at least we know, at a literal level, what is happening (eg. I may not know WHY, in a dream, I'm being chased by a herd of mustachioed ducks wielding blunderbusses, but I can at least describe it as such). FW lacks even that- because of the near-incomprehensibility of the language, it lacks a literal level to start out from.Now all of this could feasibly be tolerable- the translating, the wading through secondary sources, the silliness of a contrived \\"dream-language\\"- if the payoff was worth it- ie if Joyce was saying something really profound and insightful. If the ideas validated the words. Well, they don't. Underneath it all you just have a cliched quasi-biblical myth with aspirations to allegory. It deals with how one man is Everyman and the whole is contained within its parts and history repeats and cycles are cool and male is destructive and female is fertile. Blah blah blah. Its the world according to Joyce. If you want obsolete notions about the \\"nature of man\\" and such nonsense, read the Bible or any other religious text. If you would argue that the \\"meaning\\" isn't the point, please see paragraph two above.FW, depending on who you ask, attempts to do a lot of different things. The problem is that it fails at all of them. As music it is necessarily inadequate, as poetry it is far surpassed by real poetry, as a novel it is incomprehensible, and as a myth or an allegory it is highly derivative and essentially boring. And don't try to sell me those poststructuralist lines about \\"foregrounding language\\" or \\"de-stabilizing the signifier\\" either- you know as well as I do that FW doesn't do either of those particularly effectively, and furthermore that those are silly and pretentious concepts to begin with. I love Joyce's earlier works, but Finnegans Wake is just a monstrous waste of time and effort."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"No, Finnegan's Wake isn't written in a drab, unambiguous way, and that's a darn good thing. Unthinking directness is great for cafeteria lunch menus, but fortunately great works like FW allow us to explore ideas and language in a new way.Imagine how dull life would be if everything were always written in a way to satisfy a high school English department's style book. But I suppose some people won't be satisfied until we drop the balcony scene in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and instead Romeo just walks in and says &quot;I know our families hate one another, but I've really got the hots for you.&quot; Of course, that doesn't even begin to cover what goes on in that scene, but maybe that's because some ideas are so hard to grasp that the only way to explain them is to use obscure, incomprensible, and elusive words and phrases. Like FW.(On the other hand, don't throw your TV out after reading FW, because TV is totally awesome, no matter what self-righteous, emaciated, turleneck-wearing pointyheaded longhairs think.)"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finagans Wake is unlike anything I every read. It's a bit scary. You catch yourself seeing and thinking of words in reference to the dream world of the Wake. Give yourself about four months and get a hold of Tindall's guide.

End result: no more individual life.Still others just write reviews of it here.Who's to say which are the truly sentient beings?"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Martin Amis once drew a connection between the work of James Joyce and Vladimir Nabokov. He said essentially that both wrote novels of immense self-indulgence. My experience reading Lolita and A Portrait of the Artist supported his conclusion, because they were remarkably similar: I enjoyed the challenge of the first hundred pages, then began to become bored and long for a more humane, emotive novel. To clarify, Nabokov is famous for passages such as this doozy:\\"the distant meadows opening fanwise, the near trees sweeping up on invisible swings toward the track, a parallel rail line all at once committing suicide by anastomosis, a bank of nictitating grass rising, rising, rising, until the little witness of mixed velocities was made to discharge his portion of omelette aux confitures de fraises.\\"--Speak, MemoryFinnegans Wake is also self-indulgent in its use of esoteric language, but in a different way. Its characteristic poorly-spelled utterances parody many different modes of writing, from eulogy to nursery rhyme to literary criticism:\\"Shize? I should shee! Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye die? of a trying thirstay mournin? Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain's chrissormisss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in their consternation, and their duodismally profusive plethora of ululation.

Athma, unmanner them!\\"--Chapters 1 and 2E'erawhere in this whorl would you hear such a din again?!These are only the most recognizable of the plethora of parodies Joyce invokes in the mammoth text. They have meaning, no doubt. What is the meaning of the eulogy? \\"Twas he the decent gaylabouring youth!\\" shout hordes of drunk coworkers, friends and party-crashers at his \\"chrissormiss wake,\\" as his body is being lowered into a grave, most likely, sobbing sighs, crying and making a good deal of noise, as evidenced by the ample misspellings. How did he die? He fell off a ladder, like Humpty dumpty, and was put back together, \\"sunny-side up\\" (so his wake-goers could eat him??? Seems like it. They certainly want him back in his coffin, when he wakes up asking them whether they've drunk him out of house and home). How will this text be received? With Freudian speculation, and, as Joyce sees it, nonsense. The reviewer becomes a character in the novel himself, who seems to be writing sections of it himself in short mini-essays on various topics, obviously still very bizarre and dreamlike (the one on the Lord's Prayer has at least 200 different names for it, none of them real, all some sort of pun or biblical reference or HCE butt-size reference or other...(\\"Peter Peopler Picked a Plot to Pitch his Poppolin,\\" \\"For Ark see Zoo,\\" \\"An Apology for a Big...\\" etc).Truthfully, it is a book about the disintegration of language into nonsense. If there is a major flaw in the book, it is no doubt aesthetic, as the book lacks the momentum to keep the reader going: in a sort of prelude to the now-dominant trend of hysterical realism, in which we are told \\"how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something,\\" as James Wood puts it, we are told how the anarchy of the innermost crannies of the [dead?] mind can be rendered onto paper, rather than anything actually engaging enough to want to read. Beckett covered the same subject in his Trilogy of Molloy, Malone Dies, and the Unnameable, but in my view, did a much better job of it, creating a disturbing and utterly desolate body, but one of extreme, bleak, beauty. So did Kubrick in 2001. Like Wood, I can't emphasize enough that what makes a novels (or frankly any work of art) great is the intense emotion and wonder it stirs deep within you. That's what is missing, and that is why Finnegans Wake is simply not worth reading, at least not in the way you would read any other novel. Perhaps take it off the shelf every now and again, just for a laugh, but that's probably all you'll get."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"(You started reading Finnegans Wake at age 13?

As difficult and obscure as they were at times, they all had some relative merits.

It's a series of puns and obscurantist references without anything approaching a story or structure or even internal coherency. Of course, what could just as easily be the warblings of a paranoid schizphrenic has been inexplicably hailed by some academics as a masterwork. This is not a masterful examination of language. It's more like the musings of a 6 year old struggling with it who has a taste for bad puns and a serious case of apophenia.If you have finished Joyce other works (which are mostly excellent btw) pick up some Dostoevsky or Proust, Borges, Chesterton, or Calvino.

After just reading a small portion of Finnegans Wake here on Amazon - thank you for the excerpts because you saved me a bundle - and after flipping through a few pages of Ulysses - too bad I paid full price for the Modern Library Edition - I am now disposed to think that Joyce was the biggest humbug for a writer ever.When I read through the first page of Finnegans Wake, I was quite consternated at my limited vocabulary - I mean, after all, there were something like twenty words - I didn't count - that I didn't know! Which has never happened to me from reading any book, even Melville or Shakespeare! Then I looked some of them up and discovered that they weren't even in the dictionary.Even if some of the words are foreign and actually do exist, this doesn't prove that Joyce was a great writer in English. For a man who was so educated, he sure couldn't compose an original piece of literature with any sort of structural integrity and plot congruency.Scholars would have you believe that Joyce was a genius, whose mastery of the language was invidious. But I query which lingo he conquered, for it surely isn't English.Maybe it was because Melville wrote Moby Dick in one year, or maybe it was because he composed White-Jacket and Redburn in one summer, perhaps Joyce realized his limitations and provinciality of ingenuity, so that's maybe why he foisted Ulysses and Finnegans Wake at the public.

It is a conscious, personal and adventurous discovery, and it is one that will leave you perplexed and pleased to no end. Give it a shot. And then a dozen more. Give it as many shots as it takes to make Finnegans Wake your favourite book."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake (spelled without an apostrophe, and spelled many different ways in the actual text) is one of the most difficult, enigmatic, and comedic novels ever written. An extremist might argue that the novel is gibberish--however the language certainly is real and flowing, albeit heavily peppered with portmanteau and deliberately misspelled words. Even characters' names are spelled inconsistently, such that one may not realize how early the three youngsters, Shem, Shaun, and Isobel, are introduced into the novel until rereading. As the novel intentionally ends on the word, \\"the,\\" one can start to reread the book and discover more of its secrets just with an appreciation of the feel for what Joyce is doing.And just what is Joyce doing? At its most basic level, the book is an attempt to capture an entire night of dreaming with the same feel that a dream actually has, and it succeeds. The book reminds me of a more sophisticated version of what I was doing in seventh grade in response to novels that I found pretentious and enigmatic largely due to my more limited vocabulary and life experience and try to write literature that had that same feel, sounded interesting, but did not necessarily have any real meaning. Here, however, there is more to that in Joyce, who certainly inflects his work full of social commentary and satire, and thus, meaning. The book is predominantly composed of wordplay, and its narrative, if it can be said to have any is structural and slight.My understanding of the book is based on my own perceptions of the actual text combined with the introduction by John Bishop and the outline of chapter contents. The central character is a man named H.C. Earwicker, in the sense that he is the dreamer, but he is not telling us the story, at least not most of the time--he is experiencing it. He has a wife named Anna Livia Plurabelle, and they have the three aforementioned children, young adults now, who are major players in the dreams that follow. It begins with a town and a museum, and we are introduced to many colorful characters who never appear again, but not in the conventional way of a narrator, but rather experientially. Various crimes are committed and suspects nabbed.The book becomes lucid in a Carollian sense more than eighty pages in with the trial and exoneration of the obviously guilty Festy King, followed y his sea passage. There is something about a letter from Anna to H.C.E., but that shifts into a manifesto on writing nominally about The Book of Kells, but more trying to philosophize how one goes about the act of writing..H.C.E. has two sons, Shem and Shaun. Shem is guilty of forgery and all sorts of non-violent crimes. Shaun is the good son and adored by his sister, Isobel. H.C.E. eventually reasserts himself into the story, but while in a drinking bout with his friends, he passes out and we enter into a synapse-firing remembrance of the story of Tristan and Isolde. If you don't know the story, you won't learn it here, since it's mostly follows arguments of a bunch of men in a boat, with references to King Mark and the ill-fated romance, ending in a poem.Shaun and Shem get into a major argument over Shem's ethics, and after example and counterexample, Shem sends Shaun down a river. Eventually he crashes onto a shore and receives a new identity. Nevertheless, he is still able to speak at Isobel's confirmation in the church. She sends Shaun a letter telling of her deep love for him, perhaps not entirely appropriately for siblings, and joins a convent at the age of twenty.Shaun, now called Yawn is pushed into a seance and answers questions as numerous people. Eventually, H.C.E. asserts himself, and he proves to be brash and arrogant, claiming himself as the conqueror of many lands and going into detail about supposedly heroic acts and the building of a new city, as well as his marriage to ALP, which seems to be alternately a courtship and a rape.Nevertheless, after an examination of the greatness of a youth named Kevin, Anna Livia Plurabelle tries to wake H.C.E. This section of the book feels very romanticized. Although it is as opaque as the rest of the novel, it is reminiscent of the common romantic tropes of older couples reminiscing on their courtship and how young they were when they became husband and wife. This, then trails off into the intro, through its ending on the word \\"the,\\" and not because Joyce died or stopped writing--he lived three more years after the book was published to his exact specifications, seemingly misspelled words and all.No book has ever captured what it is really like to dream the way Finnegans Wake does--as interesting as, for example, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman is, it still takes more or less a conventional and relatively rational approach to the most irrational of thoughts and makes too much sense to be the capturing of a dream on paper. Can the book be faulted for its use of clich&eacute;s? It certainly has a lot of them, even if the hybridized words present these tired sayings with multiple meanings of new and old. More unfortunately is its frequent use of the N word in ways that do not appear to be parodistic. He even creates an obvious portmanteau with the word \\"niggardly\\" that doesn't seem to be anything but pure racism, which is kind of disappointing since so many ideas in the book seem so ahead of their time. Moments like this are embarrassing to read. It is often in the danger zone between being puerile and writing about puerility in many of its anatomical references, most of which actually do not appear in the \\"four positions of lovemaking between HCE and ALP\\" section.Overall, the work is best appreciated as a work of art with a comic vision, rather than as a story, or as a series of jokes. Anthony Burgess's comment on the back cover that the work has things to make one laugh aloud on every page is probably true. I laughed aloud at many a page in this book, and I am sure there are many, many jokes in the book that I did not get other than appreciating the entire tapestry. It left me wondering if it is even possible to do anything truly experimental with the written word, or if Joyce completed every possible verbal experiment imaginable with the book. He probably did not, but as much as I would like to write in this vein, it seems that he covered so many as to have made a creative cul-de-sac, in that one is simply doing a take-off on Joyce. Many have said that this is exactly what Samuel Beckett did, although I do not agree. While Joyce influenced Beckett, Beckett's work is pretty standard-lexicon and even a book as difficult as The Unnamable is more of a character study than Finnegans Wake, and thus move in a new direction that is not a dead end, in a spare style of observation rather than the fill-in-the-blanks of the conventional novels that general retell the same stories we already know and feel like clich&eacute;s even if there are not any clich&eacute; phrases as such. This is not your plot-driven page-turner. You will not be compelled to return to it out of interest in where the plot is headed (though you may at some points in the second half, which is a little more accessible than the first, if only because reading the first half makes the second half seem clearer), but to appreciate the artistry, the wordplay, what clever bit is he going to give you next, and what thoughts will it provoke in me. Any book that works in those latter terms is a triumph for the author. It may be a triumph for the reader to get through, but the reward is not in having finished something so difficult. I found myself wanting to read it again immediately upon coming to the final \\"the,\\" and as the clarity of the first several pages improved a great deal, I really had to decide that now is not the time to begin the book again, simply because it is such an insider work that one has to have been exposed to as much literature prior to 1939 as one possibly can to gain more fruit. Not far from the beginning, and not far from the end, are dialogues between characters modeled on Mutt and Jeff--the characters have different names from the end as to the beginning, but with all of Shaun's name changes, one can only assume Joyce wanted us to read these as the same characters--old comic strip characters most people today would be unfamiliar with, and whose names mean something to me only because I have heard of them in reference to the history of comics. Joyce draws from so many disciplines--some portions are enhanced by familiarity with the work of Mozart, for example--that it is clearly a book to return to years later, or else take a shortcut via the many books written about it. The book took me about two months to read at roughly an hour or two per day. I would definitely want to acquire my own copy and go back to it and see how my perceptions have changed now that I have a feel for the work's overall structure, although it would probably years before I reexamine the novel, if it can be called that rather than simply verbal art, musical and poetic, as a whole."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Possibly the most difficult book in the English language (if that is what it is in) but worth all the trouble in deciphering, which is immensely helped by the Introduction. I recommend also all the other guides to The Wake because, believe me, you will need all the help you can get in getting through this book. Then, read it again; then, read it again. Soon the mesmerizing language of this dreamscape will reveal its many beauties. Well worth any effort."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":".... is definitely an understatement. I thought Nabokov was an intensely self-referential and thoroughly allusive writer. This knocks him out of the park(in those departments, at least).Although I'm sure that John Bishop's statement(in the edition that has the introduction written by him) that, for Arabic and Hungarian readers, there are Hungarian and Arabic puns on every page, is an hyperbole. Most likely Joyce learned about ten to twenty words in most of these languages(most scholars guess 60 to 70 are used at least once), wrote them out phonetically(if they were in a different alphabet) and began puzzling for various contexts to place them in to be the wittiest or most clever(or, some will say, the most profound). I also think that while Joyce said he wrote Ulysses to puzzle scholars, he wrote Finnegan's Wake to fool them. As other reviewers have said he was hardly concerned with the exact replication of words when dictated or transcribed from notes to another draft. His concern (presumably; he may have had none at all) was more on the overall arc of the story(the descent into darkness and the subsequent climbing out of it; that is, if there even is a story)Not that Finnegan's Wake is a genius's(or madman's; or charlatan's...) trifle; he spent 17 years of his life on it, so of course it had atristic and literary value to him. But examining it bit by bit will likely not get you as far to Joyce's intended themes as interpreting larger pieces and whole structural parallels.Of course, there are camps that say the point of Finnegan's Wake was that anything can be interpreted in any way. And I'm inclined to agree with them. But under that, I feel, is a more intentional story of family, history, and... well, other reviews have lists of them. So maybe Joyce's &quot;Take it as you like it&quot; device is a superficial example of what he really did intend for you to walk away with.Anyhow, the first time I read Finnegan's Wake I thought it was actually going to be about a wake... I had read it was about &quot;one night&quot;, and that it was a comedy about a corpse that couldn't stay dead(&lt;-- this actually isn't an interpretation many people walk away with), and so I pictured a Rules of the Game-esque chateau where a patriarch's family had gathered to fight over the will or estate or something. Also, my 7th grade teacher, who first told me about it, had said that she really enjoyed it, and she was (to me) a conservative old lady who devoured all of those &quot;musty&quot; classics like Gone With the Wind and Emma. So I was expecting some... plot. Especially after reading Dubliners, which barely had any run on sentences.Finnegan's Wake is just as easy to dismiss as to enjoy, and I've known people that to some degree do both. But you should really scan through it(or read said introduction by John Bishop, which gives you a very clear idea of how everything goes down) instead of going by what critics, fans, or teachers say, because the traditional reader (or even the most literate one) may loath it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"One of the most supremely delicate and beautiful works of art to have been created. Ideas flit through the pages, run parallel, interconnect and cross-fertilise, giving birth to a language that resonates with numinal power. Perhaps the only book that to be understood (if such a thing is possible) must be contained within the mind, and not within clumsy ink. This is a book that refuses to prostitute itself, that forces the reader to interact and seduce it. Only then will anything be gained from it. If you want something that carries its justification and spirit within each word and individual letter then read this. And rejoyce. But a word of advice to all those who follow in its Wake. If you truly love it then it will inspire you to create for yourself. And if this is the case, then by all means echo Joyce but do not ever try to be him. For in taking up the pen you must acknowledge that, however beautiful the old artificer's book is, it is not THE book."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Gentle readers, beware! Finnegan's Wake is the most difficult book I have ever tried to read. Joyce's play with language, plot, and myth make for one of the most difficult readings in the history of literature.On the other hand, I can say (honestly) that the last ten pages of this book are my favorite in all the world of books. After the twentieth reading, or so, they began to make enough sense to my feeble brain for me to fall in love with this truly spectucular work of language."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so. And, having once attempted to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent. But the facts are as follows:1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, \\"HCE.\\" This was Joyce's way of \\"getting at\\" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree. Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago. Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: \\"How many puns and themes can *I* find?\\"This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Was FINNEGAN'S WAKE written as an experimental novel, or as a literary prose mutation? Not knowing the literary terra incognita ahead, I approached my commitment to the understanding of this book as a trek through a vast poetic jungle, with much hacking through the vines of allusion & wordplay.This is Joyce's \\"night book\\", a prodigious grabbag of allegory, history, literary allusion, and amalgamated word-alchemy. The words are fused & outright disfigured in order to assemble this pastiche, this mulligan stew, of seemingly unrelated ideas; the loops & pivots of the prose weave through many many puns, allusions and strange coinages.Without bothering to find and focus upon a plot, I felt at times I was bodysurfing though some very choppy poetic surf. Of course, there is a vague cyclical storyline in this convoluted book: the tale of HCE & his family life in Dublin etc. For the reader who insists upon a traditional story structure ... well, you can forget about finding much more than vague patterns amidst the seeming absurdities of the text.Joyce incorporated some of the text of FINNEGAN'S WAKE from listening to his schizophrenic daughter Lucia as she slowly lost her sanity. He composed this book as a leap through the subconscious imagination of mankind, with attention to all our collective guilt, conflict, love and fear. This book may be the quantum physics of modern literature ...For me, it took the better part of 5 months to plow though this book. I had just come off a harrowing 3 months of aggressive chemo and major surgery, and was looking for ways to heal up. As strange as it may sound, the unintelligibleness of FINNEGAN'S WAKE helped to restore me back to a healthy life. By the power of poetic prose, my mind was occupied while the rest of me was allowed to heal up. I can say both literally, and figuratively, that James Joyce helped me gain back my life.For a sample reading of this text, I recommend you find James Joyce on Myspace and listen to the clip where he reads the Anna Livia Plurabella chapter of FW; the spoken dream of the collective unconscious, the rhythmic cadence of Joyce's voice, all show the way to the endless cycling of the eternal ...Most highly recommended.ParataxisThe Cloud ReckonerExtracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake is the most controversial and experimental of Joyce's works. As far as sheer ingenuity goes, it is one of the greatest novels ever written. Each sentence needs deciphering as he has double-meanings, and multiple languages, in almost every word.

Sometimes, the pretentious will tell you that you need decades of study before even glancing at the first page of text, or times, it's the assertion that a dry gloss of wounded-hand heroes and other Joseph Campbell-style tropes of myth are the required lens; that the sexuality, humor, and apparent spontaneity are all illusory because this is a serious book. Of course, it is a serious book, because sex, jokes, and the moment are all serious things. Serious enough for great consideration and extended rumination, serious enough to include one truly tragic and one genuinely funny moment per page, at a minimum. But, never so serious the ribald excitement, the childish humor, the elegant puns or pretty wrecks should be locked up and kept from everyone.One strain of Finnegans Wake's story is just that, the locking up for fantastic elements of our everyday wonderful existence, ostensibly because we aren't educated enough, serious enough, or blessed enough to have and appreciate nice things like that, and throwing away the key into a fastrunning stream of rhetoric. But the rest of the Wake is set in opposition to that strain, makes a mockery of those empty stabs at repression, those silly trite bouts of selfish self-congratulatory elitism pretending to be knowing concern. Finnegans Wake has little need to obfuscate for any reason but to entice, as a beautiful scene beyond a parting veil or a what-the-butler-saw peep machine. It makes a burlesque of life, and teases away while giving forth just as that, but it is not malicious in its restraint or its flourishes; it wants us to come along!Foremost, Finnegans Wake is fun and wants us to have fun. Anyone tells you different, is lying or misguided. Lilting leaning longing lunging lusting and lasting, the Wake wants us all along. It wants us to keep up. I say it, because it does escape the commands of authors and the demands of readers. The book lives extant, it reacts to us as we react to it, and its self-reflexive nature allow the read of the book, the text(s) and the gloss(es) to grow and change as we grow and change, as the world, its history present and future change.You understand Finnegans Wake. Go in knowing that and let no one convince you otherwise. What you understand, reading it, may not be what someone else understands, but neither need by incorrect or immature. You understand Finnegans Wake. It may fall on you as a happy wreck's debris hits the street or is sucked out to see, it might rule over you as queenly puns or prestigious parents, but parents are always progeny, too, queens are moved about quite easily when you are playing the right games, salvage has charms to muse as sooth (or something similarly reaching).The book is about a mountain and a river and as anyone who has played king of the mountain or water games knows, if you take the games too seriously, the conquest as more important than the play, you probably end up having a miserable time every moment you aren't on top. Give up the conquest and go for the play! Jump in, splash about, climb to see what you can where you can, and to jump that much further and make that much bigger a splash when down you crash! And ignore anyone who tells you, you can't backstroke along a mountain or climb up water; \\"Any landing you walk away from,\\" they say, \\"is a good one,\\" and that includes the landing at the top of the stairs, the height where you're king of the hill, or the muddle of the river rushes."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not as good as sex...depending.

Joyce was the world's colossal novelist of some of the greatest verbal, parodistic, historic, metamorphic metaphorical powers with more learning and intellectual ability than any Einstein, Eisenhower, Edison or other. To cite a minor case: Joyce knew all of the Wake word for word, the full Book of Kells history of Ireland, the works of Flaubert, some number of operatic works, and an inexhaustible number of miscellanea. The vicarious thrills of the bourgeois hero-centered novel and attendent intellectual masturbations are met with and answered best by Joyce's book. Finnegans Wake cannot be understood without an extensive study of the literature and history alluded to, if it is to be intelligently understood--but neither can the world.

Not Everybody. In terms of quantum reality theory and cyborg anthropology, The Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix.While one could break the book down into a basic linear story, which weaves and meanders through the seven-stage structure, like a river, the reductionism or deconstruction approach is itself vulnerable.While there are many serious threads, FW is also a minefield of literary and linguistic-phonentic puns. I once read a review in which the writer dismissed the word \\"upfellbown\\" as one of Joyce's many nonsense words. Nope. Upfellbown is a phonetic portrayal of the German word apfelbaum, or apple tree, which Joyce had mentioned slightly earlier in the text. Where people often go off the deep end is in attributing undue significance to these individual words.If The Wake is about anything, it is about phenomenology or holism versus reductionism. The significance of the whole versus the sum of the parts. You don't understand The Wake, you experience it. On a vastly simpler level, the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys brilliantly captures the beauty of the recursive temporal symmetry that underlies Joyce's re-entrant epic.For those who have never read FW, it is basically about an Irish bricklayer called Tim Finnegan (Finnegans Wake being a traditional song, of sorts) who falls, probably drunkenly, from a ladder. The 'story' that follows is either his Death Dream or Near Death Experience, in which the entireity of Earth's history cycles through his mind. (There has even been debate about the identity of the Dreamer.) Symbolically, Finnegan's fall from the ladder could be representative of the Fall of Lucifer or the Fall of man.The Wake means whatever it means to the individual reader at that point in his or her lifetime. For me, the many references to the Triple Goddess and Masonic ritual leaped out of the text. Yet had I not read so much about these things, the references would mean nothing. Yet, I have probably missed thousands of things that others will see.Quick example... The three main female characters, Kate, Issy (Isis) and ALP form the principle references to the presence of the Great Mother/The Triple Goddess. Both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are about return. The return to the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. The beginning and the end of Time.Issy is Isis, who is in herself the Mother Goddess. Issy's room is blue with a ceiling of stars - \\"the twinkly way\\". A classic feature of the ceilings of Masonic lodges. Sirius, the Star of Isis is the Blazing Star of freemasonry, whose square and compass logo can be extended out to form a pentagram, depicting the four elements, plus the fifth element - the Creatrix. The third degree ceremony of freemasonry is a symbolic death and rebirth, symbolized by the skull and crossbones - the sign of Osiris risen. The Wake, which itself is about rebirth and resurrection - Finnegan = Finn Again, has many esoteric references, and even obvious ones, such as PHOENIX Park, and the fact that the book is set on March 21st, the Spring or Vernal Equinox - the beginning of the pagan New Year.Aw hell, I'm rambling. That's the trouble with The Wake. It sucks you in. Give it a shot, but don't try to understand it from the outset. Try to just read it all the way through first and then maybe do some dissection. Whereas Ulysses is 24 hours out of Bloom's life, allegorically interwoven with the Ulysses myth (instead of returning to Ithaca, he returns to Number Seven Eccles Street), FW is just too massive to see a linear series of exact correspondences. There's also a great deal of literary chaff. The man had a sense of humour, after all.The bottom line for me, is that The Wake is about the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, like Chocolat, like A Midsummer Night's Dream, like Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, like Cities Of The Red Night...Here Comes Everything..."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"If someone tells you he or she has read Finnegans Wake and understood a fair amount of it, you may safely assume he or she cannot be trusted to tell you the truth. Read the first five pages -- any five pages -- and declare otherwise. I dare you. Although there are undoubtedly a handful of literary scholars who feel compelled to try to grasp everything Joyce wrote, the vast majority of those who actually venture to wade through it -- let alone those who pretend that they have done so -- are playing ego games."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"There are scholars who make their careers on Finnegans Wake. I have read many of them, hoping to understand this book. However, among the scholars, there is no agreement as to what this book is about, or even if it is about anything, or even if it is readable. To those of us who have enjoyed Joyce's other works, such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and The Dubliners, Finnegans Wake is a real disappointment.The book consists of 628 pages of crypticisms, foreign languages, and languages that haven't yet been invented. In those 628 pages one will struggle to find two words that actually go together to form a discernable thought. Of his works, Joyce said, &quot;Ulysees is the day; Finnegans Wake is the night.&quot; Well, I take a lot of walks at night, and even on moonless nights I can make out shapes and shadows, something that is quite impossible in The Wake.No one will ever deny that James Joyce was a brilliant writer. But, it took him 13 years to write Finnegans Wake. If he actually meant to say anything, 13 years is enough time to come up with a way to do so that actually communicates. This book actually seems like Joyce took a set of the Oxford English Dictionary, placed it atop a couple of sticks of dynamite, detonated the dynamite, and walked through the fragments, writing down whatever his failing eyesight was able to pick up. Hence, one is left with the conclusion that Joyce has succeeded in pulling off a hoax, the literary equivalent of the Sokol hoax on the high-brow journal Social Text. And this is what is so disappointing about Finnegans Wake.If you feel that you must read James Joyce (and you should), then by all means, read one of the aforementioned books.

I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's &quot;genius&quot; and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegan's Wake is a beautiful, profound work. It succeeds as an interpretation of the dream of everyman (history). The reader becomes an active part of the novel because, even if two or three meanings escape notice, the meanings that have relevance to one's own life stand out and are easily interpreble as having signifigance to the entire work. Secondary sources are unnecessary. Understanding the entire work is not the point of reading the Wake- the book is meant to help one understand one's role in history, but not to allow a holistic vision of history itself.As an expression of the state of sleep from the sleeper's perspective, Finnegan's Wake is intentionally garbled and thrown together as a rubbish heap of information from the dreamer's life. Because the sleeper is meant to represent Everyman, however, the dreams and thoughts of this particular night are applicable to everyone's life in some way or another. As in Ulysses,although to a greater extent, the words are often obtuse while the scenes depicted are commonplace. This gives an air of mystery and insolubility to everyday life. You may say that this is disingenuous pompous posturing- but I would respond that life in itself is a great mystery and that I am sorry you think you have it figured out.The language is decipherable, but don't read the book just to decipher the words. As with any novel, the innate joy in reading it is just that- reading it. Take what you find therein- if you do, upon reading it again, you will find more. The humor and power of the work shows itself again and again if you allow it to do so, and the many meanings and perspectives of Joyce's universalism are often subconciously understood and not realized as such until later thought.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a great amount of time on their hands. \\"Phall if you but will, rise you must.\\" Dive in; Finnegan's Wake does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"A test of patience?

So on Izzy, her shamemaid, love shone befond her tears as from Shem, her penmight, life past befoul his prime.\\"This quote should be the example under \\"obfuscation\\" in the dictionary, or perhaps \\"q.v. \`Finnegans Wake.'\\" If you have not the patience, nor the intellectual wherewithal to wield a skeleton key to unlock this cryptic prose, then you may not want to bother, because this quote is relatively tame.Howevernever has the concept of living in the moment been more prevalent; one must literally take each sentence word by word- just to enjoy his belletristic meanderings, luscious lyrical lilting, extensive portmanteau's, abandonment of grammatical sense and plot linearity, and on and on. Some words can be made out, of course, even if his sentences construction purposely shuns any discernable semblance of the rules of English. Deciphering each lines meaning would surely risk your sanity (and take a lifetime). My advice: just enjoy the ride. It's okay to do this. This is not a conventional novel and it does not have to be read conventionally. Really, it's okay. One necessity when reading this book is reading aloud in your head. Your brain may see \\"huh?\\" But when it's spoken you go \\"oh.\\" I couldn't really decipher any fine plot points. There was like, a letter... Finnegan and a wake was mentioned multiple times... Yeah... I heed my own advice.Thus marks Joyce's penultimate achievement; a unique hodgepodge of hitherto unmatched literary artistry, and a brave absence of linearity and all convention of plot. A bold move for a famous author writing what I'm sure he knew would be his final novel."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Reading this is the literary equivalent of doing pull-ups.I thought it was interesting to read it out loud, like poetry. It had a different feel to it that way.Boring, gratuitous Finnegans Wake story follows:I had heard about this book for years, ever since high school, and one day, while in college, I went to the library and took out a copy. I started reading it and thought, \\"What the . . . . \\"Actually I realized I was reading Anthony Burgess's short version, so I went back and took out the real thing. I showed it to my friends who were likewise all bewildered.So next I marched into my 20th Century Literature professor's office and asked him what was up with this book. He actually began laughing at me. When that was over he told me I shouldn't simply start reading Finnegans Wake, I should begin with Dubliners and then move on to Portrait. Then I could try Ulysses. If I made it that far I could proceed to Finnegans Wake.At that time I had just read The Promise by Chaim Potok and was impressed with the way those Jewish kids studied the Talmud with various guides and commentaries opened side by side - so that is the way I approached Joyce - like a young Talmud scholar. (But on my own - never in the context of a class or seminar, unfortunately)I found Burgess's ReJoyce very helpful, and of course there are a million Ulysses and Finnegans Wake guides available.Eight years later (punctuated by six years of podiatry school and residency) I had finally finished all four and honestly have no idea what I was reading as far as Finnegans Wake was concerned; but I appreciated the style, the rhythm of it, and the overall experience."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is not really readable, straight through anyway. But I own a copy and I flip through now and then. I treat it like a long poem, and then, it can be cool. The language sounds good and you can get sucked into it and there is something of a plot I suppose. I personally think the book is a blend of Eden and Babylon; confusion and also paradise, and Joyce was probably bored. This book is more of him being a linguist than a novelist. I recommend the companion by Burgess called Re-Joyce and would say, you may not want to buy this, just get it from the library. But you would have to buy it to play my fun game with guest: What Are You Reading. Here is how you play- whenever someone says wow you have a lot of books, so what are you reading now, I say Finnegan's Wake and hand them the book. Read a page I say and then walk out of the room. When I come back their face is priceless and really, the conversation could go in any direction. Now that's worth paying $8 to have the book laying around."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The thing that makes Joyce so difficult is his tendency to write stream of consciousness, with an emphasis on the here and now. But you figured that out.In Ulysses, the narrative is more or less linear in time. Not necessarily so in FW, or not obviously so. Where Ulysses' narrative involved a sort of mumbling about what to prepare for breakfast, a running commentary of the act of doing so, and then fleeting thoughts of friends, family, and events from the past.FW? Well there are definite sections to the book where the mood and the activity level changes. I'm told this indicates the various stages of sleep, and the physiologic changes during sleep.That being said, the rest of the book is less of a narrative and more successive word plays, tangents, I understood only a fraction of his references in English to literature and history. I understood very little of the foreign language bits - and there are many bits from many languages. You'd pretty much have to be an ethnographer to get any of it, I believe. It not Reader's Digest, that is for certain.But I still believe it's worth reading in a odd out of control sort of way.Who the hell is HCE?I plan to obtain Joseph Campbell's \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake\\" and use it as a study guide next time. Joseph Campbell was one of very few people in this world with the extensive knowledge required to actually understand James Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is full of made-up language, words as long as your arm and an almost incomprehensible grammatical structure. I tried to read it three times and gave up. Since I don't have to do it for college, I'll let others imagine they can understand it and tell you how fabulous it is. For me, it is too difficult to understand--like the ravings of a lunatic. If it has a message, I don't see it, and no-one whose review I have read of this book has ever convinced me that they have understood it any better.It's apparently a grand book for the literary elite to parade in front of the rest of us while puffing out their chests and patting each other on the back, boosting their own conceit. I think it a massive prank by Joyce. One which has taken many in and will no doubt continue to do so for time immemorial. To listen to people state how fabulous this book is and how monumental it is for them and then have nothing whatever to tell about what they actually got from it is nauseating. I think Joyce must be chuckling in his grave at these literary lightweights pronouncing this prankish experimental book a perennial classic."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Before continuing this review I would first like to make it clear that I have only read parts of 'Finnegan's Wake.' Not the entire thing. I personally don't think it's necessary to read all of 'Finnegan's Wake' to truly enjoy it -- it is, for the lover of nonsense, explosive creativity, and utter literary chaos, a delight. I loved what I read of it and intend to continue sifting through it's many linguistic treasures. Who knows, maybe I'll finish it one day.'Finnegan's Wake' was an experiment. The result of an idea James Joyce wanted to flip around. I'm sure all you writers out there understand the concept -- Joyce was trying out a new form of the art. Whether or not he succeeded is totally up to the reader. Fan of the nonsensical? Sick of technical, murky prose? Give 'Finnegan's Wake' a try. To those people (myself included), Joyce's book is an absolute joy; a hilarious, thought-provoking joyride through the English language.However, there is the other side of the argument, a side not entirely without merit. 'Finnegan's Wake' makes no sense. Literally. It is not supposed to. It represents the intricacies of Joyce's complex mind. There are those that scorn that type of literature, calling it pointless and difficult, lacking depth and meaning. To them, 'Finnegan's Wake' is a failed experiment. Perhaps you are one of them -- if so, read the lovely section Amazon has open and decide whether or not you REALLY want to spend your money on this book.What's truly wonderful about 'Finnegan's Wake' is that it's ambivalent. It is the embodiment of ridiculous (sometimes frustrating) linguistic puns, yet also hints at a deeper meaning. Perhaps that in and of itself was Joyce's experiment, to create tension between the rational and the irrational, and he's poking fun at us 'artsy intellectuals' as we argue over this oddity in traditional canon.One last note: to anybody that enjoyed 'Finnegan's Wake', I would highly recommend John Lennon's book 'In His Own Write' (yes, John Lennon wrote other material besides songs). It is a similar mish-mash of twisted words, running together in a very James Joyce-esque manner. Sometimes the similarities are eerie. The one thing about Lennon is that his work tends to be slightly more coherent..."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"If you've heard anything about this novel, it was probably that it is difficult.

Not a book for the impatient. --Sean Moberg --13 years old"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think alot of the reviewers on both sides here have no business reviewing this book in the first place. Let me explain with this example: If you don't speak French and you pick up a book written in French you will probably recognize some of the words and even understand a few sentences based on knowledge you might have of basic French and because of the similarity of many French words to English words (or whatever language(s) you know). But you won't be able to completely understand the book unless you sit down and translate it. It would be stupid to proclaim that the book is a failure just because you don't understand the language. In the same way, you might appreciate the beauty of the French language and think the book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it, but this is no reason to claim that the book is a masterpiece.We might as well consider Finnegan's Wake as a book written in a different language that we aren't fluent in. A book (or any work of art, for that matter) isn't bad just because you have to work to understand it. That may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad. So, if you don't think it's worth the time and effort to use reading guides or whatever to make sense of this book, then you should just leave it alone instead of going around acting like anything you have to say about the book has any merit whatsoever.On another note, it's completely absurd to review this book just as you would a book by Stephen King - based on how entertaining the storyline was or how realistic certain characters were - simply because this is not what the book is aiming for in the first place. This would be like judging the Mona Lisa as a piece of crap because you're a big fan of cave drawings showing a chain of events and you didn't see what the chain of events was in Mona Lisa. You judge a work based on how well it succeeds at what it is trying to do, not at how well it succeeds at what everyone else it trying to do."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"NO!

If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY \\"sentence\\". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of.

If this were not written by James Joyce, would you call it a \\"literary classic\\"? No--it would belong in the discard pile with lots of red marks on it for lack of basic grammar and sentence structure.There are good stream-of-consciousness novels out there. I read Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway from cover to cover and it is actually entertaining. Or, at the very least, the sentences actually flow together in the way people would actually speak them.So Finnegans Wake is a dream-like mumbo jumbo. The question is, is there any purpose to it? Why should the reader spend time and effort deciphering the cryptic nonsense in order to figure out what the story actually is, when there are perfectly coherent novels out there that actually tell the story as it is?For one thing, if the author needs to disguise the plot with a ton of fancy language, it just means the plot is too thin to be interesting on its own. Secondly, the English language is perfectly functional. So why break something that's functional to create something that's not?"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"James loved to play. In fact it seems he enjoyed playing alone more than he did with others. Nevertheless I give James 3 stars for his playfulness, and for showing us emphatically that rules are for fools. For the same playful spirit along with coherence, wisdom and compassion I highly recommend anything by Nobel laureate Jose Saramago, in my humble opinion a superior writer to Joyce and a writer who writes for and plays with all of us. My feeling is that wisdom, compassion, and the abilty to communicate lucidly count for a whole lot more than linguistic gymnastics, ingenious experimentation with the archetypal nature of words and impressive erudition. If there is in fact something of substance in Finnegan it will be found by very few. Try Saramago. (I am the self-appointed minister and creator of the Jose Saramago church of common sense.) With his vast knowledge of mythological tales, I'm sure that James Joyce knew that after the hero goes into the dark forest to search out, and finally attains the boon, he returns with the boon so that the world (or at least the social group) can also enjoy the benefits of that which was won. Although I do believe that Joyce found his way there, upon returning he shared that hard won boon with only a few of his buddies. Fortunately for all of us, there were those who took the boon from James and learned from that which it offered. Was James Joyce a genious? I believe he was.(however) In The Portait and his other writings he states clearly what he considers to be \\"proper art\\" and improper art\\", declaring that \\"Art\\" intended to teach, instruct, guide (didactic), is not \\"proper\\" to what he feels to be \\"ART\\". He pretty much stuck to that. After Dubliners and The Portrait, he didn't teach us anything. Although Ulysses and Finnegan are certainly \\"ingenious\\" creations, They are not Great books. A necessary quality for a great book is to have an affect on the reader beyond and above entertainment, fascination, self enjoyment. I'm with Saramago and Tolstoy on this one."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I admit it. I never 'finished' Finnegans Wake. I did not sit down and read it from cover to cover like I did Ulysses. And yet I read Finnegans Wake. Those people who treat it as a hoax are missing the point. Finnegans Wake was meant to be read out loud in small sections. The richness and beauty of the language are unbelievable and the cohesive structure of the book is astonishing. The book begins with the passage of water, and ends with the sea. It is the journey down a river, the journey through life. During the past few years I have picked up Finnegans Wake on numerous occasions and read parts of it. It is beautiful. The sounds are so overwhelming that I always find myself repeating them over and over. Joyce was a master with language and this book was his 'masterpiece' of language play. It doesn't matter that you don't understand the words. Read it for long enough, and the words will begin to make sense. Maybe by the time I die I will know the full meaning of Finnegans Wake."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I read Finnegans Wake in eight days. My goal was to get through it, reading every word and trying to make sense out of the puns but not worrying excessively about deciphering the meaning. Someday I may go through it with a fine-toothed comb, but this time around I wanted to read it as I would any novel. The verdict?Well, Finnegans Wake is clearly masterfully put together. For someone like me, with a solid knowledge of Latin and word roots, the puns that made use of etymology (and those are a large proportion of the puns) are not difficult to decipher; I also frequently had the pleasant experience that miscellaneous bits of obscure knowledge floating in the back of my head, that I never thought I would use, were jolted into memory by a passing reference in the book. Joyce poured references of every describable kind amongst the pages, and I could tell that I was not understanding even a small fraction of them, nor was I (by a long shot) understanding the book at every level. Finnegans Wake is like a delicious ice-cream cone that is covered in one of those crunchy shells. Now, imagine trying to eat through that shell only by licking, and that is what kind of task getting to the meat of Finnegans Wake is. The reward is delicious, but you have to lick through a heck of a lot of hard chocolate and nuts (I would liken biting through the chocolate to using one of the companion guides: you get to the good stuff quicker, but it might alter the shape of the ice-cream by biting off a chunk).Painfully protracted analogy aside, Finnegans Wake is an excellent investment of time for an educated reader, and even (dare I say it?) fun. Yes, the words are impenetrable, but they are just difficult, not outright gibberish, as some would dare to say. Go on, give it a try!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"In his classic collection of aphorisms, The Trouble With Being Born, the Romanian-French essayist Emile Cioran, makes the following remark: \\"Once we reject lyricism, to blacken a page becomes an ordeal: what's the use of writing in order to say exactly what we had to say?\\" James Joyce spent seventeen years composing and recomposing a book that he undoubtedly knew would be unintelligible. This maddening monstrosity, this monumental darkness, takes on the universe itself in its mixture of breathtaking poetry and emptiness. It is at once the saddest and the funniest book ever conceived. Our heart breaks for the author, a man nearly blind, poverty stricken, sickly, in whom such ambition was festering, in whom such an enormous soul flashed and fizzled. Thank you, Mr. Joyce, we remember you fondly."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Much of the humour of Finnigan's Wake comes from reading the book in a Dublin accent. So if you've never been then try and go and apply the cadences of speech you hear to the novel, new avenues will open up within the text itself and other passages will reveal themselves."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I've read &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; nine times. Verdict? I dunno, let me read it again. When you read Joyce, you get Joyce. Stick with trash if you're a normal. So it's unusual. So what! His books are what the greatest mind of the 20th C. have left us: so be it! But be forewarned: his world can be addicting."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake may be my favorite book of all time. Not that I completely understand it, but the incredible beauty, mastery, and especially mystery of its language is astounding to me. This is the ultimate re-readable book, since it takes many readings to even begin to make sense of it. FW is probably not for everyone, but for what it is, it is amazing. Certain passages have a quality of uncanny timelessness, despite being somewhat incomprehensible, and deep down there is a simple story of humanity. This is Joyce's great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I don't understand this book. I picked up many literary aides and guides to this book and set about getting through it. It is so subtle and difficult... the rewards of understanding this book are not worth the effort. This is a good writer trying to be a real literary cool dude and give PhD students something to focus on. But I admit, the reason I don't like this book is because I am an illiterate moron. I should have never picked this book up; I wasted precious time I could have been watching &quot;Friends,&quot; or &quot;Seinfeld.&quot; I could have been working on cherry-red Camaro, or down pounding some brews with my buddies, watching the big game. Or I could have been wallowing in my own filth in the pig stye I call my den. This book must be fabulous, I am sure, but because I am a lazy, ignorant, slovenly fool, who likes his books monosyllabic and easy to digest, I don't like this book. I wish I was Mr. Cool Guy College Professor and this book could be my life, but all I have is my rear-projection TV. Tragic, *sniff*"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I'd like to address some of these other critical reviews, thought by thought, as most are intelligent people who are asking all the right questions but cannot accept the answers they are coming up with. Your right FW is not \\"readable\\", in the normal sense. If you must have a good, solid story, a \\"page turner\\", which entertains you and that you finally \\"get\\", a story where the meaning is clear: then STOP right now. This book is not any of those things. Its \\"intention\\" is to disorient and confuse, to produce an \\"aesthetic arrest\\" and to be an epiphany. FW will never be a blockbuster movie, Hollywood will not touch this. Finn again A WAKE is written, kind of, sort of, in english. One reviewer called it a crossword puzzle in novel form, she is partially right. You can read other [negative] comments from the more simple-minded reviews too, but time has and will prove these knuckleheads wrong. Some claim intellectual independence as a smoke screen but they are hiding behind a myopic view of art and they do not want to put in the effort to research the references and push for a bigger picture. Other reviewers say it doesn't mean anything, Isn't poetry or music but there is a personal hatred to their reviews that tells me they are mad at the art work for not revealing itself, clearly, to them. This group is reviewing and revealing their own frustrations at not being able to conceive of or make great art. True critics, I suppose. They want to defend their defination of what art is, for everyone. This group is quite adamant and takes FW personally, like they are on a crusade to inform the world. I suppose, Joyce has worked his Irish magic on them too.. their banner reads:Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.critics want to define artistic \\"quality\\". In any case, the \\"ideas\\" of FW have universal essence and are of an epic nature. Unfortunately, some reviewers want the transcendent nature of life to be clear, right in front of them, religion is what other people do and everything is just as it seems. Look, some great works of art do not speak to all, [Picasso's - la guerre] but make no mistake; this book is an incredible work of word art BUT does not reveal itself easily OR to everybody and that is exactly what Joyce wanted, he wanted a few sensitive and intelligent readers to experience an epiphany about the cycles of death, life, myth, history, love, war, hate, sex[lots of sex], \\"social marketing\\", male female, brother, sister, mother father- how these patterns of archetype forces affect us, this is another \\"reality\\", parallel to ours but in dark matter; [Unconscious and subconscious]. FW is not describing these forces but placing us in them by disorienting us, making the reader become part of a jumbled up night world of myth and universal cycles. How these forces of life affect us is a confusing book during the day [James Joyce's Ulysses] but at night they really go off [Finnegans Wake]. People, It doesn't get any more insightful than that.Another reviewer, a Mr. T.Powerless, who wrote a review of the \\"FW Skeleton Key\\", - keeps asking:What you think this book is trying to say in its 600+ pages of indeciperhable ramblings (and some proof would be nice)How he can write a review of a book about the meaning of FW and still keep asking this questions is befuddling. His theory is that it is all just random letters [never mind the puns and historical stuff] and there is no meaning and that all the smart people have been fooled, except him. Finnegans Wake is 95% \\"deciphered\\" but something is lost in trying to put this art book in sound bites or one-sentence sayings. Take the phrase \\"reveiling the night\\". It is \\"saying\\" several things at once, each makes sense but it is also mixed up, obscure and in the mystery of the conjoining of mixed up words, is the art. There are straight forward ideas that can be expressed from FW: one of my favorites- how we should strive for things and concepts that uplift the spirit and these will pull us together, because they inspires us as one people, not on material stuff that separate us, but- really, so what, another \\"good\\" idea but silly in a way. Like the \\"ideas\\" of Hamlet: often puerile, but with Shakespeare's brilliance take on new life. And, when JJ writes the brilliant connotations are imbued in his art. The art is lost in my translations. Yes, but the critic keeps asking, its not clear and What does it MEAN, - but... what is meaning and is meaning always clear?? The hackneyed haiku: the sound of one hand clapping?- what does it mean? The meaning is a paradox or another question. all those things that do not have a sound when struck, but what does that mean? It is not about the meaning of life it is about the feeling of being alive. If you must have a meaning rather than another perspective, understanding or an epiphany: Warning: stop reading FW before you get mad. Clearly, T.Powerless kept reading, couldn't find what it was saying and became irritated.However, FW, as a bit of a mixed up crossword puzzle, demands an explanation, a guide, patience, translations and a key. The best starting points are John Bishop's book and Joseph Campbell's \\" A Skeleton Key to FW\\". In other words, FW MUST ALSO BE STUDIED LIKE A TEXT BOOK, clues must be researched and an adventure game like quality to the mysteries and the possible solutions can be fun. yes, for some tracking down the sources and uses of JJ words and relating it to the essence of a sentence or chapter is part of the mystery. Others see The historical period of FW reflected in the work: pre World War II. Freud and Jung going at it, Picasso and Matisse going off, it was a heady time for all the western cultures. AND to top it off Joyce dies sudenly 6 months after the book is published in 1941!!! Although Joyce hated FW to be called surreal, FW is an abstract work of art and as such, like any great conceptual or complex philosophy [Nietzsche or Wittgenstein] or abstract art, is extremely personal and open to much interpretation. One can get several versions of exactly what is being \\"said\\" from the same passage; this really upsets the material minded and if you are not prepared for this kind of art or thought or are resistant to abstract art then, chances are, FW will be/ is gibberish to you. As The above reviewer states correctly: a good work must have great style, FW has a style of immense complexity and quality but NOT great clarity, intentionly.FW is a huge Irish joke about the cycles of human life, art and thought. There is a twisted sense of humor in this Irish consciousness making a sad joke of life; the punch line is about the Devine Comedy of existence. FW is also an intentional riddle with several answers; the 60 different languages, puns, portmanteaus [the crossword part] with historical and mythical referances as well. the reader can wander and wonder about this book of life for hours or years. At times, like any fine work of abstract art: it reveals the artist and viewer more than the \\"reality\\" of the subject. No, FW can not be translated into another \\"language\\", no it was not written in the way other books are, The 4 books were not written in order and can be understood as independent sketches on different and recurring themes. Yes, joyce had a comprehensive and firm intention when he wrote it. If you start to dig and study the text the book becomes an obscure magic workbook about the recycled archetypical nights of human consciousness. However, unless you are a scholar, you must study the philology or it becomes drivel and unless you have an open mind and can embrace obscurity the work quickly becomes irritating. The sound of the words can be helpful and so some find that FW is often less abstract if read out loud. Like the Hindu vedas, which are songs or hymns, FW has a lyrical quality when read out loud too. In any case the puzzle must be solved in the dark as characters, stories, change, transmute; opposites are defined and then become one and need each other and then digress again. The simple \\"story\\" has been figured out, the references have exhaustedly been researched for the last 70 years and still there are mysteries to this work. Joyce intended this too and future generations will appreciate, miss understand and wonder, love/hate it, fight over and review this book!No, not everything printed on paper is literature and not all words are found in a dictionary, not all communication is with words, from the dictionary, or for that matter verbal. So the one reviewer that says he doesn't dream in puns and his dreams are about \\"something\\" is confusing the description of a dream with the conjuring of the \\"reality\\" of a dream world, using language. the difference between going to the movies or describing the movie. Joyce is NOT trying to describe a dream; he is trying to put you in a dream cycle of life forces in motion. JJ is comunicating with strange english sounding words to make a language of dreams. Joyce's subconscious, night world is obscure, intentionally, like \\"real\\" dreams. This bothers people, just as their own dreams do. This night book has stages, like the night, but there is no meaning to the actual story or beginning or end, the individual dreams have \\"meanings\\" and there is a progression but, like reincarnation or purgatory, there is no end or beginning . How do you escape such a work of art? perhaps a third book about Nirvana or Paradise: a simple book, like the Paridiso of the Devine Comedy. Cambell thought this was in the works when JJ died.I'm sure the greatest thing is NOT to listen or watch the defenders of FW. Although there are some fascinating works on the Wake and Dante, Vico, the Egyptian book of the dead, the book of Krells, Cabala, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Talmud and lots of dream consciousness-etc. My suggestion is to read or scan it, with JC's \\"Skeleton Key\\" or Tindall's so you can get a sense of what is being said, see which of the 4 books speaks to you and then start digging on your own, the best annotated guide is now on the internet, John Bishop's book is insightful. he also wrote the intro to the Penguin edition. Stop after a while, put it down, read some other stuff, pick it up later. I knew almost nothing of the philosopher Vico and had not read Dante. James Joyce was a true artistic personality and scholar and, as an eccentric, sardonic Irish scholar, he wanted to be obscure and drive all the other [Irish and non Irish] scholars nuts. NON SERVIAM I am slave to none- was the motto he lived by. This book is intentionally obscure and Joyce is known to have re written parts that were not obscure enough!! WHY? Again, dreams can have several meanings because the dreamer and the dream are one. the dreamer/reader must decide which meaning is pertinent to the story and to your own story and see if it fits. There is a subjective part to making something abstract and a subjective part to interpretation the art. Unfortunately, this vagueness plus the references and language threw the doors open to the cross winds of scholarly conjecture. At the end, however, Joyce is communicating something powerful, eternal [not about time] and wondrous but the reader/dreamer must be prepared to study, dig deep and interpret and sometimes just guess. A Warning label would say: it took him 15 years to write it. 1] There is no bottom 2] the journey is \\"reveiling\\". - if FW doesn't speak to you, that's cool; just don't say there is nothing there if you can't find or see it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Haven't read FINNEGANS WAKE in many years, probably not since grad school, but here it is again, everybody talking about it for some reason--it's resumed its place in the zeitgeist, the way Frank O'Hara's \\"Meditations in an Emergency,\\" featured on the season opener of MAD MEN, is now rising up Amazon's best seller list as we speak--has anyone noticed the boxed ad for MAD MEN on AMC right on the page for \\"Meditations\\"? Merchandisers don't miss a trick. When I first read it we really thought it was the greatest novel of all time and we aspired to be just like James Joyce. Then postmodernism set in and FINNEGANS WAKE seemed valuable as a monstrous failure, one that moreover had everything in it, a capacious junkyard like the \\"golden\\" scrapheap at the center of Dickens' OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. In any case I pulled it off the shelf last night at 7:30 and have just come to the end, feeling like I've just swum the English Channel.The back story has never been less obvious to me. Okay, I can just about believe that the whole of the novel (bar some \\"real life\\" events impinging on the dreamers' consciousness--chimes, house noises, bladder pressure) takes place during a dream of a very sound sleeper, but how do they know for sure his name is Porter and that he actually has three children? I always liked the idea of \\"Kevin,\\" my own name, being taken up by the great novelist James Joyce, and that \\"Kevin\\" was the golden boy of the family, but now I don't even remember how I knew his name was Kevin. In any case the dream of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker shows the eternal return of man (and woman), the endless of cycle of history, exemplified by the legends of Swift, Parnell, Adam and Eve, Tristan and Iseult, even nursery rhyme characters like Humpty Dumpty and Little Boy Blue. The two boys are always in competition with each other, and physically different too, like Laurel and Hardy, except sexier, while the young daughter is the apple of daddy's eye, and sometimes he seems to be lusting after her in an incestuous way. The great setpieces remain hypnotic, but it is significant that they are the extracts that most respect genre conventions--the trial of HCE, the procession of ALP giving out treats for 111 \\"children\\" (or are they the witnesses in Porter's trial for--and what is it he did in Phoenix Park, showed off his \\"penrose\\" I expect? The puns, anagrams, and blended languages keep one guessing, but I can see how they might grow wearying--just keep inhaling them, like weed, and you'll be able to ride the wild surf to the end.I noticed on page 387 that there's a reference to \\"poor Merkin Cornyngwham, the official out of the castle on pension,\\" and I wonder if this is where Merce Cunningham got his name from? Because it's such a grab bag, you can find everything in the book, and it's no wonder my professor used to say that Joybe had predicted events like the Berlin Wall going up, the assassination of JFK and the war in VietNam. Without even meaning to I found Lindsay Lohan! You doubt me, punk? The extravagant exchange of the quarrelling washerwoman, in which every river of the world is named, yields the following: \\"The wee taste the water left. I'll raft it back, first thing in the marne. Merced mudde! Ay, and don't forget the reckitts I lohanned you.\\" After that I knew I would find Lindsay, too, quite close, even though her name might be muddled. Page 527 has, \\"Linda, our seeyu,\\" that sounds close, or how about page 492, where \\"Lindsay\\" becomes \\"Loonacied,\\" as in \\"Loonacied! Marterdyed!! Madwakemiherculossed!!! Judascessed!!!! Pairaskivvymenassed!!!!! Luredogged!!!!!! And, needatellye, faulscrescendied!!!!!!!\\" Why all the exclamation points? More acts of prediction, mirroring the way I feel about Lohan's relationship with Samantha Ronson. All in all, a five star book with something for everybody."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"When I first saw finnegan's wake in the library, I had already heard of its difficulty and strangeness, before i lifted it and looked inside, which only affirmed my suspicion.it was then that I decided I would never read the book. it took only a year or so later to decide to give it a shot.Of course, i recommend at least some sort of guide to help you through, because this is the most difficult book to read possibly in the history of man. 'A Skeleton Key...' is a good one, but I have never checked the other guides so I cant recommend any others, but Campbell's other book on Joyce, 'Mythic Worlds, Modern Words' is also good, perhaps even better, because it provides a guide to all the works of Joyce.He was a difficult writer to read and of course he will get even more difficult to read as his 'pop' (not sure if i should call it pop...) culture reference...historical references is a better term, when his historical references become obscure...not to mention he is a very vague writer, and he expects the reader to exert him/herself on his works constantly. But once the rudiments of the story gather together inside of your head, you can see the sea of information he had inside of his crowning achievement, and thus the reason for the title of the review, and the true beauty of his rambling words, sentences and phrases that at first glance mean nothing, only to eventually coalesce into meaning and poetry.it is a very difficult read, but those up to it might be able to appreciate its grandeur.also, to spoil some of what joseph campbell says in his 'mythic worlds, modern words book', this book is purgatory, evidenced by its dreamlike repetition and idiosyncracies, while Ulysses was Inferno, his illumination of hell within the psychologies and eccentricities of the human mind. his version of paradise was never written, but campbell finds within a letter Joyce wrote to his brother that the words were to be 'simple, lucid' (a clear departure from anything he wrote).i almost feel cheated now that he never wrote it....makes you wonder what might have been in his head, after his latter two monster works..."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I read them aloud with my kids, age 7 and 5. They have been force fed phonics and Dr. Seuss for the greater part of their lives. I read to them nightly, and have to compete with video games and action adventure comics for their imagination.2 sentences in I knew I had them; They were wide-eyed. 1 page in they were slack-jawed. After 5 pages I closed the book came the myriad pleads &quot;No, don't stop...&quot;Thank you, Mr. Joyce, for making my children smile."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"As an experiment in styles, linguistics and forms, Finnegans Wake is magesterial beyond all others. No book can compare. Much like Ulysses, it's actually very disciplined, very precise and very carefully constructed. Logic demands this. Our need for a logical universe demands this, or an endless wave of unjustified insults upon the writer as a hack, an idiot, a maniac, a con-man or something else...Firmly and foremost, the book is grounded in Irish culture, is a manifestation of the meaning of the Irish ritual of the funerary Wake...It is also a combination of works Joyce had in development at the time; a series of short stories called Finn's Hotel. Perhaps in that isolated, seperate context, things could be understood in a traditional fashion. At the very least, there would have been something of a context for interpretation. Not just for academics, but for regular readers. I don't think Joyce wrote for the intelligentsia, the academia or the writer crowd, certainly only some of his contemporaries in those lots spoke well of him...In the end, Nora Joyce was right, it's literary Chop Suey, chopped together bits, ideas and other things, shot through Joyce's obsessions with lyricism and languages to the outermost extreme of his abilities. The result is pretty much incomprehensible. It's a monster of a book. Reading it is to pick a fight with the Dragon. You will never beat the dragon, but even if you did, you don't get much.I consider it a fine literary accomplishment, and personally I love this book. This literature. This reflection on literature. But I can't in good faith as a critic whose opinions might be read by others recommend it. I mean not to insult or demean others by any stretch. There is little to recommend. It appeals to a certain niche audience, the literary equivalent of stamp collectors.If you must, I have only this advice:1. Don't try to understand it as you read it. The book is written as a series of loops; indeed, it is a loop. Both in its literal construction and in its overall purpose. It is the cyclic notion of history, myth and language interaction. You'll read a page, for example the first page, be taken aback by it, but keep on reading. The skeleton of the plot emerges. Then go back, focus on different details, then another one emerges, entirely unrelated. You'll know when you've come to the edge, or pseudo-edge of the loop, and then you can construct something...I think...I'm probably wrong. Most interlingual stuff is out of my league. I barely passed 8th grade public school Spanish.2. The book is like trying to make out every feature of every person passing you by on a highway where the traffic is going at around 300 miles an hour. This is a book however. You can stop the traffic, reverse it, look at individual passers-by in detail, and learn everything you want or need to know.3. This book is a dream. It is someone's dream, and the dreamer is unknown to us. This is one of the reasons why the plot is so tenuous, and even if it were written in only one language, operating on this understanding means that anything can mean anything, itself or anything else. That it is written in this gobbledygook of portmanteaus, puns, allusions, geographical complexes and so forth forces us to do what we would be less willing to do: Search for a meaning. Back to the review of this, this is not an admirable quality. One which is hard to deliberately construct, praise be to Joyce for this, but not something that makes for good reading, light or heavy.4. Be patient. It's easy to say this, having wrestled with around fifty pages of the book's near incomprehensible prose and able to casually cut the trees of the forest to know what lived there once, but if you're going through this the first time, just relax, chill out. The book will be there when you get back, decode the history, solve the puzzle. It's fun, if you're into it. If not, woebetide the Joyce fan who's near you!5. Read it aloud as long and as clearly as possible. Unlike many books, most books actually, including everything ever written by Joyce besides this, when read aloud, there is no wrong way to read it, or understand it. Understanding it as the half drunken slurs of the dreaming Irish mindset (vaguely resembling the fully drunken conscious slurs of my Irish uncle) is one way. It yields consistent interpretability and meaning, with all the strange stuff (the phronetic Turkish, for example) just the stammerings and the yammerings of the dream mind attempting to assemble the words. You might miss out on something. I'm probably missing out on something too. However, I'll read it. I'll understand it, to some degree. And in that I am satisfied.6. It's probably worth it to try to decode gibberish and gibberly expressions in this book in as many ways as possible.Aches-Les paines, ache the paines? The windows of a building? Ache as a name of something, the paines referencing glass, Cathedrals perhaps? Aching pains? Taking great pains? There is no concrete answer. And this is just one example, the entire book is written in this fashion...7. As historical trivia, Joyce did explain to a man how to interpet this book and understand it for what he was trying to do...That man never shared the information, and Joyce died suddenly after revealing it. Instead of some monster super-Ulysses, we get a great puzzle. An undecodeable puzzle in my opinion. You can wrestle with the Leviathian all you like if you want, frankly I can find more entertaining and worthwile literature elsewhere."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think what I enjoy most about it is that--like e e cummings--charles dodgson--emily dickinson--his joyceness gives us all persimmon to push the limits of our language.

In 1999 (this is 2005) I started to read the Wake, with the best of intentions, but I soon noticed a problem. A few paragraphs in, my mind would start to wander, for there was nothing solid that my mind could hang on to. I encountered no setting, no characters, no plot, no narration, nothing concrete nor conceptual. The best that I could say was that every once in a while, some group of words would be evocative of an image or memory, but even when this would happen I could not say for certain whether it was intentional on the part of the author or accident. Eventually, I started reading it aloud in order to keep myself \\"in\\" the book but, no help. Today, I am 100 pages in; I can't really bear to read more than a page at a time, and even this is an effort. I get as close to 'zero' from reading it as I can imagine.Now, please understand that I am not a stupid man, nor unaccustomed to difficult literature. I've a college degree and, in fact, currently teach 10th grade English. I've read (and understood), among other things, Shakespeare, The Bible, War and Peace, and also Ulysses. It is sometimes said that this book was written \\"for the intelligensia\\"... well... I consider myself part of the intelligensia and this book was not written for me. I am not here trying to argue that the book was written as a joke, or has no actual meaning (though I think those arguments have some merit, when one considers the work) but that a person who picks this up and starts running their eyes over any given page will not be engaging in the same activity as they would when reading a book. The Wake might be closer to some sort of giant puzzle, though I doubt this as well, but a prospective reader should ask himself whether he wants to engage in a 600 page rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \\"written\\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?Is everything printed on paper literature?I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read. Don't feel bad--it wasn't intended to be read. Through it all, the most interesting thing and the greatest value of the book is to watch the actions of the book's defenders. They haven't read it either, in any meaningful sense, and yet like the people in the fable they claim to see the clothing. After all, people of the highest virtue are able to see the Emperor's New Clothes, you see.

Those readers who cannot make sense of the novel should begin with &quot;Dubliners,&quot; and when they have successfully digested that, proceed chronologically through Joyce's works; to pick up Finnegans' Wake and then try and read it without having any of Joyce's nuance of style under your belt is akin to mental suicide, and, worse, will frustrate you into not reading Joyce at all. Every word, even the hundred-letter Thunderwords, Joyce placed carefully in his seventeen years writing the novel; surely, no one of them can be easily dismissed after one or two hours' cursory reading. What is more, the book requires only that someone have the barest knowledge of Language to begin with-- it is the human sense of music, that sense from which language derives all of its power to both frighten and quell, that Joyce's prose tries to capture. Little wonder that certain episodes from the book have been called &quot;The greatest prose ever written by a man.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Joyce's Finnegans Wake is a masterwork of linguistic indecipherability. His puns, wordplays and encyclopedic depth reflect the genius at work in this novel of night. The disgust shown above clearly reflects a culture of sarcasm and anti-intellectuality. But this novel is no place to start with Joyce: he made monumental leaps between Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake--to start at the end is like trying to do quantum physics without having taken an algebra course. Joyce has written either the twentieth century's masterpiece or the greatest practical joke in academic history. Try to read the work, but understand its context."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I don't think that Finnegans Wake itself makes so many so angry. Rather, the offending party is that tiresome brood of sanctimonious and disgustingly pedantic clowns collectively insisting, in a manner devoid of decency and respect for the common man, that it is the greatest and most important piece ever written, that somehow the entire history of the universe is encoded within its babblings, that it is their duty to proclaim its manifold glories to the vulgar masses, and that you are but a debased philistine and a hopeless product of the MTV generation if you either don't like it or can't understand it upon your first perusal. It is they who engender such ire, and deservedly so. Ignore them. In the words of Christ, \\"Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\\"The idea that one should sit down and read FW as one would your average novel is as absurd as they come. I say that if you are so inclined and are looking for a challenge, by all means give FW a try. Dig up for yourself a quality dictionary, preferrably of the Oxford variety, whether in print or online (many works of classic literature practically require one as a companion piece anyway), an explanatory work like Campbell's if such suits you, and dig in. Take it little by little, don't feel yourself obliged to plow through it like a steamroller, and don't be afraid to read other, lighter works along the way (this last suggestion also works for those looking to tackle Proust in its entirity, but that's another can of worms). Reading it aloud, as has been said, is highly recommended. Of course you're not going to understand it all or even most of it(those that say they do belong to that class of fools already mentioned), but with adequate preparation and time for reflection you'll surprise yourself. No, it isn't easy, but it absolutely is rewarding. FW is one dense fruitcake, and it is comforting to know that you can return to it again and again throughout your life and continue to pick out all manner of goodies.So if you like it, great! If you don't, you're in good company, as some of the sharpest literary minds of the 20th century didn't like it either. In the end, it's a matter of individual taste and whether or not you're looking for something as radically experimental and unique as this. As I have read somewhere (although I forget where), Ulysses was Joyce's masterwork and this, his grand experiment."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"How I would mourn being inside the brain of anyone who cannot simply ENJOY something and instead demands:1) A plot. &quot;Hey this is a book/movie, howcome there's no plot?

They're right, of course--nobody fully understands this book. That's the whole point.'Finnegans Wake' does not tell a story; it plunges the reader into it. The reader becomes the dreamer-- things are slightly out of focus, the real and the unreal mix freely, words and thoughts blur and merge together, everything has multiple connotations, and it is both beautiful and baffling. However, its not simply unstructured chaos-- there is a &quot;plotline&quot; which seeks to examine the relationships between members of a family through the dreams of H.C.E (the central character and father) and his wife. But Joyce extends the &quot;plot&quot; far beyond the specific characters, so (like 'Ulysses') 'F.W.' becomes timeless.Speaking of Ulysses, I think many people (I, in some ways, was one of them) are upset when they realize that F.W. is entirely different, because Ulysses is so amazingly beautiful and perfect. Many reviewers here ask why Joyce didn't write more of the gorgeous prose-poetry of 'Portrait...' and Ulysses. Here's why: Joyce was genius. And geniuses never hold still for very long. Ulysses proves Joyce as a literary master. F.W. proves Joyce to be a master of ideas, art, and language itself. Comparing Joyce's previous work with F.W. is like comparing apples to oranges, as his aims and motives are entirely different. 'Portrait' and 'Ulysses' are both literary masterpieces, while F.W. is simply a masterpiece (though it may perhaps fail as &quot;literature&quot; because it isn't meant to be-- that probably won't make any sense to those who have not read it). The structure, ideas, and concepts Joyce puts forth allows F.W. to transcend the medium of a book; it really belongs on its own seperate shelf at the library or in a museum.Bottom line: 'Finnegans Wake' is a work of art. Those who dismiss it because it is confusing as well as those who try to analyze the meaning of every word are missing the point. Its beauty lies in its confusion, double-meanings, and wordplay. Yes, it is difficult, but reading F.W. is an experience that no other book compares to. It is beautiful. It is chaotic.

In bibliomancy, you open a book to a randomly determined passage and peruse the selected text for insight into a question or problem so vexing that you've turned to divination for answers. Traditional books for this purpose are the Bible and Homer.The Bible and Homer are not ideal for this purpose the way Finnegans Wake is, though. With them, you're likely to light on something like a genealogy, a ship catalogue, or instructions for the curtains on the Tabernacle. But every page of Finnegans Wake is properly oracular, laden with obscure hints that might actually shed prophetic insight on the topic at hand. No other book is its equal for this purpose.And, of course, Finnegans Wake also has the advantage of being inerrant in all matters of fact clearly stated therein."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"John Lennon put out a book while the Beatles were still together, titled IN HIS OWN WRITE. That title is a Joycean pun (it's even \\"bad\\" and ungrammatical in the way of Joyce's puns) and the entire book and its sequel is written in the manner of FINNEGANS WAKE, slightly simplified (fewer foreign words).John Ashbery also writes in a simplified form of FINNEGANS WAKE's style, and some people think he is the greatest living American poet.Thornton Wilder based his 1942 Broadway play THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH on WAKE, and was \\"found out\\" by Joseph Campbell and by Edmund Wilson.There are several other writers who have been influenced by WAKE in this way, including several hit rock lyrics. Lennon's book was not only popular among Beatles fans, it demonstrated to lots of them how Lennon was a very special and intelligent writer -- yet he couldn't have written it without the example of Joyce behind him.All this is no particular reason to think WAKE is good or great. But it did create a new way of writing, and that new way has led to success for other writers beside Joyce. That in itself suggests that WAKE is an important book. It can also be thought of as a \\"failure\\" or a \\"mistake.\\" Even so, with that kind of influence, it would still be important.Of course it didn't spring up out of nowhere: the Humpty Dumpty chapter in THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS covers a lot of its techniques. And there's a lot of writing from the nonsense writers of the nineteenth century that is (deliberately) harder to understand than WAKE, or even impossible to understand, because the authors wanted it that way. Those writings were also popular and influential. Some people enjoy nonsense. And of course language specialists study nonsense, because it shows how complicated language can get and still be interesting (and worth the price of a book) to some people.Joyce was a very thorough comic craftsman and he had a lot of fun with his works. He is not part of a conspiracy and readers like John Lennon liked him from Day One.

Upon release it polarized critics, with its sampling of 60-70 different languages, its use of multi-lingual puns, portmanteaus, it reads more like a word puzzle than a book. It has no discernible plot upon first inspection. The first sentence is the middle of the last sentence making it an endless cycle, and upon first read it looks like a load gibberish. And you friend reader may wonder why one would read such a work? Simply put: It is one of the most brilliant works of the 20th century (or any time for that matter). Here is the reason why. It is highly inter-textual, upon closer inspection you can see the level of detail Joyce put into this work. Every page is layered with meaning upon meaning upon further meaning. If you calculate it, 17 years, 628 pages, thats about a sentence or a little more a day. With that said. How can anyone say (like these many one star reviews) that it is just gibberish. if someone wrote that little a day, it should be apparent that this is the exact opposite of gibberish. Gibberish is to imply that it is nonsense and lacks meaning altogether. This couldn't be farther from the truth with this work. Each word or group of words or sentence is so packed with meaning that one could spend a week analyzing one page. That is the complete opposite of gibberish in my opinion. but also, this work is a hilarious tome of comedy and beauty. its use of language can make you laugh on every single page. but I digress. this work as previously stated is a work of genius and there is the reasoning.

One reviewer says his 'farts make more sense', while another says he urinated over a picture of Joyce because he couldn't understand the book. Pathetic. Sounds very like a 12 year olds reaction to me. I know, I know, it's a big step up from your Harry Potter books, but get over it, you either like it or you don't. I find it hilarious to hear people rave on and on about how Joyce commits disgusting crimes against the English language and so on. It's so plainly obvious that the people who write these things are people who are frustrated and afraid because they can't understand a book that is so acclaimed and highly-regarded and so to cover up the fact that they simply couldn't decipher it (which is nothing to be ashamed of) they attack Joyce and accuse him of destroying the English language. Give me a break - he revolutionised it.Now, Finnegans Wake is not exactly a book with an exact point or meaning to discover. It is there for you to use, so to speak. It is a wide open universe of sound, image, thought.... almost everything. You can just open a page and draw something magical from it. It is like an encyclopedia of literature. It is also probably one of the most self-indulgent books of all time, seeing as only Joyce was able understand its 'true' meaning, if there is one at all. It would be completely impossible to read this like a novel, page to page, chapter to chapter. This is a book with no beginning and no end, literally. The first line continues from the last line. This symbolises the theory that history goes around in circles. There really is not much to be said, other than you can find every other book written inside Finnegans Wake. It is a linguistic zenith. It is the sum of all modernist work. It is a masterpiece. And, there is no pretense or snobbery with this review. I am an Irish teenager and I happened to enjoy Dubliners so I read his other books in order of their release, and I found each one a work of genius. This is not simply an intellectual book, for intellectual garble is only a fraction of the books power. I feel you could give this book to a ten year old and they could fall in love with it, that is, if it had a nice colourful cover with smily faces and flowers on it. Anyways, that's my review.

Briefly:1. Books are written to be read. They are to be read in a human language, not in a privately constructed enigmatic mishmash one can decipher, but the process of deciphering leads to...nowhere. Even turgid &amp; clumsy philosophical authors like Hegel or Heidegger had something to convey, a &quot;vision&quot; of reality. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, on the other hand is a carefully constructed labyrinth of &quot;perennial&quot; themes, inducing in reader's mind...epiphany ?...wisdom ?...emotions ?.. no, unfortunately only boredom. This is a book built on books &amp; mythic ( rationally catalogued ) patterns, but not a living creation nor a powerful myth itself.

What are the merits of this book ? Let's see:a) is it cognitively strong ? Do I perceive the world in enhanced or expanded way after reading it ? Plato, Nietzsche, Augustine, Shankara, Jung ? No.b) is it aesthetically satisfying ? No. Apart from a few &quot;musical&quot; passages, this is, compared to Joyce's earlier work, a sad spectacle of a &quot;noble mind o'erthrown&quot; ( or ensnared by its own projections- something similar to the Tibetan Book of the Dead ).c) is it a book of wisdom, like Conrad's or Proust's ? Or of mythic power, like Melville's or Dostoevsky's novels ? Or a &quot;philosophical&quot; prose, like Mann's fiction or Freud's essays ? Or esoteric vision(s) of cosmos, like Tantric or Gnostic scriptures ? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding NO to all these questions.I suppose the only people ( apart from professional idolaters ) who would extract some sort of pleasure by reading &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; are folx who revel in puns, conundrums &amp; rebus-addicts.

And the blather about circular design reflects something I recall reading about how Joyce intended the reader to be able to read the book from any point and in any direction with equal felicity.

Instead of &quot;reading&quot; this James Joyce monstrosity, just get 10-15 different foreign language dictionaries, then program your computer to randomly jumble words together. Every few lines or so, make some random allusion to some mythology, or country, or river. You'll get something completely indistinguishable from Finnegan's Wake.

Well, that's nonsense. For example, the quote &quot;bad of wind&quot; is supposed to make us shudder with admiration for such a clever author, since (supposedly) &quot;bad&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; in Persian. Ah hah...get it? So clever! What a genius!Well, you know what? &quot;Bad&quot; has meanings in other languages, too, including English. I doubt Joyce knew three words of Persian. My point is that in a collection of random nonsense words as dense as Finnegan's Wake, a HUGE number of randomly selected words and letter-groups will have meanings in SOME language. There are lots of languages out there, folks. Coincidence doesn't make genius.I'm not saying ALL the &quot;puns&quot; are unintentional, but that doesn't mean that Joyce is an artist.

Of course, that PhD being in a &quot;hard science&quot; (i.e. physics) will let me be villified by all the &quot;pseudo-scholars&quot; (you know who you are: people who, instead of making their own works of art, devote years of study to someone else's creativity).Anyway, I guess that the purpose of a review is to let someone who has NOT read the work know a little bit about it. Well, I have not read the book in its entirety. I bet the number of people OF ALL TIME who have read the entire book, living or dead, is ZERO. That includes Joyce. And the original editors of the book.Q: how many typos are there in Finnegan's Wake?A: How would you know?Summary of my main point: there are intelligent people who think FW is pointless. You can think that, too, if you have the courage. Don't pretend you &quot;like&quot; the book just because you think you have to.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I see a plethora of 5-star reviews here for Joyce's opus. I think it is natural to dislike it, however, and I don't think it makes a neanderthal of me because I dislike it too. Look, as a teen I read Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica; I struggled through at least half of Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and I've read Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Faulkner. I don't mind struggling with a book if I can mine something from it. FW is too long for such playful babble. I might read a pamphlet of such gobbledegook just for the fun or the exercise of my imagination, but this monster book? I have to feel that Joyce was playing a joke on everyone, or he'd really gone off his rocker. Why should we even bother? I also read Beckett's Waiting for Godot and found that a complete waste of time. My reaction was that it was absurd, but I guess the theatre of the absurd is supposed to be just that. But why bother? I can stand on a crowded street corner and hear trivial chatter as meaningful as Beckett's play. It kind of reminds me of something I saw in an art gallery years ago, during the \\"pop art\\" craze: a rectangular piece of cardboard, painted with white enamel, mounted on a flat-white background, named, appropriately, \\"White Enamel on White.\\" Yet it had an inflated price tag, and I did hear a few oohs and ahhs from people behind me. Feeling like a barbarian, I snorted and left the gallery. This is art? And Finnegan's Wake is literature? Please, give me a break.Words that don't communicate are just meaningless black symbols on white paper. What was Joyce trying to communicate? Sure, I can get a kick out of several minutes of it, but then I'm eager to return to the real world. I can't help wondering if the 5-star reviews for FW are written by the same kind of people who sighed over the white cardboard in the gallery, or who find deep meanings in Waiting for Godot. Still, maybe I am a barbarian, and maybe they're of a higher order than I am, so I'm willing to congratulate them for finding gold ore in FW, and wish them happy babbling on their re-read of this inflated classic. Joyce I don't demean, but this FW is a perfect waste of time. If this is literature, then it's at a dead end."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"this book is like so cool man i mean it is like watching the spice girls movie cept its in a book i really like it so i think you should buy it"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity?

There are many far greater works that not only tell the same story, but are readable and even enjoyable.

And obviously it doesn't. Apparently, Joyce -nearly blind at the time- he wrote FW wrote out a lot of the text &amp; had it typed up. Apparently, fairly often the typist couldn't read Joyce's handwriting, so she would guess what the word was. Joyce is reported to have been amused by these errors &amp; let them stand. Also, Beckett took dictation for a lot of FW: enough said...I don't think Joyce was interested in referential sense. And I agree that FW works more like Modern art than a regular book. In his mixing up words at the morphological level, he exploits the gap between signification &amp; meaning to such an extent that meaning is so exact that it abstracted -kind of like Andy Warhol's car crash pictures? A text definately more than a &quot;book&quot; FW is in my opinion one of the original self-referential ones &amp; for that a lot cooler than most texts. I like to read it for the sounds of the language &amp; I like criticism on it becuase that actually makes sense. An annotated book like the one for Ulysses would be awesome!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The question of the Wake is rightly espoused by Harold Bloom, who wonders, and then affirms: \\"Can one live the whole of literary history in a night's sleep? Finnegan's Wake says yes and asserts that all of human history can pass through one in a long, discontinuous dream.\\" The long-accepted and necessary route a writer must take toward greatness is to read for influence, to read as much as possible, and then twist all of that into one monstrosity of singular talent, and by doing so, to create your own voice. James Joyce took this further than any other writer in the history of the world, and in the end, because no one else (as the novel and the legacy of literature dies) will ever approach what he accomplished in Finnegan's Wake, he is the only writer who shall ever have the credit of having absorbed all of literary history, turned, and exploded all of it onto a page.The criticism of the Wake universally stems from incomprehension, and I allow, the work is certainly incomprehensible. What the nu-Critics cannot understand, however, is that literature does not have to be clear. Are any of you crazy enough to truly believe Joyce wrote the Wake to have it read in the same manner as Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\"? This is a work of literature, not of entertainment. The reason that fact fails before this generation is because literature is dying at the hands of those whose worth to humanity is far lesser than that which it is destroying.The movement misnamed \\"multiculturalism,\\" which is altogether anti-intellectual and anti-literary, is removing from the curriculum most works that present imaginative and cognitive difficulties, which means most of the canonical books. Finnegans Wake, Joyce's masterpiece, presents so many initial difficulties that one has to be anxious about its survival. I suspect that it will find company in Spenser's great poetic romance, The Faerie Queene, and that both works will be read, for the rest of time, by only a small band of enthusiastic specialists. This is a sadness, that we are moving toward a time when Faulkner and Conrad may have to endure the same fate. One of my closest friends defended her university's decision to drop Hemingway from the required course in favor of a rather inadequate Chicano short-story writer, by telling me that her students would thus be better prepared to live in the United States. This is why literature will die.I can hardly explain all the reasons why Finnegans wake is a masterpiece, a work so singular in nature that it belongs alongside Shakespeare, Dante, Milton, and Tolstoy. That argument would far exceed word requirements posited by Amazon,com, for the work is indeed that deep. It is not a book for high school students, or even for college students, and we will never again live in a society where it might be the choice of a casual reader. Joyce's masterpiece is to literature what Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\" is to philosophy: utterly blinding to anyone who has not had a long and studied history with their respective subjects. But for those who give it a genuine try, I can recommend only one piece of advice: read it aloud. The words so many claim Joyce makes up in the Wake are not made up, but purposefully misspelled. If you read it aloud, you will realize what he means to say.Finnegans Wake is the ocean of literature. It is everything that has come before, and because of our culture, will likely be more than what will ever be said after. I leave you with the monologue of of the dying Anna Livia of Finnegans Wake--mother, wife, and river--which is frequently and rightly esteemed by critics as the most beautiful passage in all of Joyce.\\"But I'm loothing them that's here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it's old and old it's sad and old it's sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt and saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.\\"Going on fifty-eight he wrote this final fiction, and was dead two years later. We will likely never see another like him, and given our current trends, likely never take the time to study him as we have studied authors before, to recognize his greatness. His memory will die. Look at this book's rating on Amazon. Three and a half stars? This novel took sixteen years of Joyce's life to complete, and people have the audacity to believe he intentionally made it difficult to play a joke on those he left behind? Finnegans Wake is a masterpiece worthy of a thousand stars, and soon none will see it. The words of Anna ring true, as if they come from Joyce's own mouth: \\"I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me.\\"It is a genuine shame."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This version of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting \\"Finnegans Wake\\", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I didn't expect to like this book at all. I certainly didn't expect to fall in love with it but that is exactly what happened! I love this book! It is really funny and readable, in fact it's a page turner! It really is a lot of fun and as I already said it is funny on almost every page. I think of it as a long beautiful poem written in a dream language. I like it better than any other Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Without a doubt this is the most fun I've ever had \\"reading\\" a book. I frequently had to put the book down to wipe my eyes and blow my nose from the tears of laughter. After just a few pages I started taking notes so I could go back to especially humorous passages and read them to friends. Forget all the garbage about how difficult the book is and how it will require all sorts of study and research to appreciate the deep meaning and language. Nonsense. There is no meaning and there is no language. The book is a continuous series of some of the funniest writing ever commited to paper. I suppose the reader gets from the book what they already have in their own mind and from the things I got from this book . . . I undoubtedly have a very dirty mind. Joyce frequently comes up with \\"sentences\\" that strike me as undoubtedly and hilariously obscene (in the best possible way). Honestly, this reads like a series of those filthy limericks that make you marvel at what sort of demented and nasty mind could have conceived them. For me, this is quite simply one of the dirtiest books I've ever read and certainly the most fun. I'm not even sure that \\"reading\\" is what you do with FINNEGANS WAKE. I confess I have no idea what it was about and couldn't care less (because I'm fairly certain the only person who knew what any of this meant was Joyce himself). It dosen't matter. This book is hilarious and not at all difficult to read if you immediately give up the idea that you need to understand it or even be able to pronounce it. Folks, there isn't anything to understand here. Just delight in what the book does to your head because (make no mistake) this book WILL do something to you as you \\"read\\" it that is somewhat like a strange and euphoric form of hypnosis. It is a work of absolute genious and a true one of a kind. It's the only book I can think of that contained characters who purchased wallpaper to match the cat. This is a book for EVERYONE to enjoy, not just stuffy academic \\"Joyceans\\" and those of the professorial ilk, in fact this is really a book for people who don't even like to read. I can't think of any other book that I would give a more enthusiastic endorsement of than FINNEGANS WAKE. If you are a fan of DUBLINERS, PORTRAIT and ULYSSES but have avoided reading this one because of its reputation as being impenetrable, then please dive into it with joy. It's a lot more fun than ULYSSES (though undoubtedly ULYSSES is the greater work as a \\"novel\\") and you will never have to work at trying to keep up with the plot (a sometimes difficult task with ULYSSES). READ IT READ IT READ IT. You will never be sorry you did (unless you have no sense of humor) as it is the greatest literary joke book ever penned and will almost certainly never be bested. You will enjoy it even more if you have (as I apparently do) a very dirty sense of humor. Don't let the length worry you either. It took me two weeks to read it and it was never a chore. I can't imagine what the people who say it took them years to finish were actually doing with this book. They were either more capable of wringing amusing perversions from it than I was or were more likely (sadly) trying to understand it. Don't try to \\"get it\\" just read it and you WILL get it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think the time has come for Finnegans Wake fans to stop having to constantly justify their passion for this book and share our favourite aspects of this inimitable work.What often gets missed among all the discussions about the book is just how funny it is. There are few books that have had me crying with laughter - this is certainly one of them.Joyce's inventive use of language allows him to create a world like no other - few more enjoyable reads can ever be had."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Reading James Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (first published in 1939) is like reading a long really long surrealist poem. I got started by printing a 30-page article from Wikipedia and using it as my guide while I read book from book, chapter to chapter. Even the title is a mystery. There is, of course, no apostrophe between the \\"n\\" and the \\"s\\", so this is not a question of possession. It's been suggested that the title is actually a corruption of the phrase \\"Finn is again awake\\", Finn being the father of the gods in Irish mythology, like Odin in Norse mythology. But near the end of the book Joyce actually uses the phrase Finnegan's Wake, complete with apostrophe. The novel itself seems to be an interpretation of the symbolic death and resurrection of Finn or Finnegan in the person of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, whose name at times changes to Porter (Earwicker is the keeper of a pub), a mysterious sin he may have committed, and how it affects his wife Anna Livia Plurabelle and their three strange children, all this in very obscure poetic prose. Many scholars such as Edmund Wilson and Joseph Campbell have devised a plot out of all this abstract poetry, but I have to admit that finding a conventional plot in Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is like finding a representational landscape in Pollock's \\"Enchanted Forest\\". It's significant that the scholars disagree on which chapters mean what. (I also have to admit that I have not read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\", which is evidently considered indispensable.){Note: Since writing these comments I have read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\". Yes, it is erudite and enlightening, but readers should be aware that this key is almost as complex as the novel itself.} By the way, I would have sworn that no one would possible attempt a translation of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (that way lies madness!), but evidently there have been translations -- one in Japanese, no less. There is also a reading of the complete text on 17 CDs by an Irish philosopher Patrick Healy; but, you know, I really doubt if it's on Amazon.com's bestseller list. The reader must work his way through a thicket of puns (Book I Chapter 8 is a catalogue of the world's rivers and at one point an impatient gossip cries: \\"I amstell waiting. Garonne, garonne!\\") and obscure historical references (Earwicker's name may derive from a British politician Hugh Childers whose girth gave him the sobriquet Here Comes Everybody) as well as deal with mythological and Biblical comparisons. Scholars seem to agree that the novel was inspired by an 18th Century Italian work \\"La Scienza Nuova\\" by Giovanni Battista Vico, but a more familiar Italian book could also be mentioned, Dante's \\"The Divine Comedy\\", because Joyce's \\"night novel\\" ends with the revelation of dawn. Will a reader really be able to work his way through its nearly 600 pages? I think if you approach the book as fun (after all, it's considered a comic masterpiece) rather than as a chore, you'll find that its light wittiness outweighs any heavy expectations you may have had."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Far and away the best thing about this book is the quality of the analysis it has spawned. The book itself is drivel; but the reactions to it form some of the most intelligent and enlightened reviews I have encountered. I have never sprinkled as many \\"helpful\\" votes within a single site as I have here, to both one-star and five-star appraisals alike.Firstly, the book itself. I cannot subscribe to any of the academic apologias. This book took an interesting concept and stretched it well past the point of absurdity. Like the surrealist movement that ultimately ended up justifying paintings of Campbell's Soup cans, \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" takes stream-of-subconsciousness to such idiotic lengths that it becomes self-parody.Yes, I have exhaustively analysed the book. I studied it many years ago under the tutelage of an infectiously enthusiastic English professor who dissected its every nuance. Puns, portmanteau constructs, auditory versus literary jabberwocky, dream-state evocation: we analysed all of these elements and more. And for a time, during my \\"intellectual\\" period, I pretended to admire it. Nowadays, age and--I like to think--wisdom compels honesty: this book is a self-indulgent conceit. Had anyone other than Joyce written it, it would never have been published, much less garnered all the notoriety it has enjoyed over the years.The real value in \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" has been in the intelligent debate that it has fostered. By stringing together chaotically connected thought fragments, Joyce created the literary equivalent of a star-field: any resulting patterns are a tribute to the richness of the readers' imaginations and not the writer's.Does Joyce's exercise constitute genius? Hardly. Artificial Intelligence research has produced numerous examples of similar jabberwocky constructs, some practically indistinguishable from \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". So what we have here is a sampling of the peculiarly human ability to impose order upon chaos. Some of these five-star reviews are testaments not to the meaningless jumble that is \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", but to the creative ingenuity of their authors and to the larger genius of the human imagination.Joyce was not a prolific author, but what he did produce was some of the best writing ever conceived. \\"Portrait\\", \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Dubliners\\": each is a star in the literary firmament. It is natural to try finding a place for his last work in the same firmament, but \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" doesn't deserve such elevation. This novel was the product of a genius who in the end became so narcissistic and self-absorbed that he dared to pen a scatter-brained homage to his own ego. Would we dismiss this work as vapid nonsense by any other author, it would be dishonest to do otherwise just because that author's name is James Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I just finished reading FW last night after almost six weeks of thorough plowing-ahead through it. I don't know where to begin in my review of it. I would start by summing it up in the word amazing. This book reinvents language. All through school, we're taught grammar, spelling, punctuation, the format for writing essays, letters, etc., but Joyce rejects that education, says the hell with it and does his own thing. What interpretation of a word is right? Is there a correct interpretation to be conceived? Is there any possible way to wrestle the magnitude of this book to the ground and pin it down to really understand what's going on?? Who knows. Joyce has the reader in the palm of his hand, and it's frightening what FW can do to one's mind. I'm sure that now everything else I read will make me think of Joyce in one way or another. I probably don't know 2% of the amount of foreign languages, literary, geographical, historical and mythological allusions and references which are crammed into the book, but the parts that I CAN decipher are very clever. It's not an interesting &quot;story&quot;, but it's captivating simply because it's such an enigma of a book.There is not so much a story here as there is a SERIES of stories or vignettes parodying various myths, historical events, etc. But several patterns occur and reoccur. Variations of the initials H C E and A L P (What does Joyce achieve with FW? Why, He Confuses Everyone! All Living Persons!), rearrangements of the name of Finn MacCool, the mythological Irish hero, and the predominant Vicoian theme of history repeating itself. H C E is born and reborn as Adam, as Humpty Dumpty, as Finn MacCool himself.. ad infinitum. Joyce deliberately left the whole thing open-ended so that every word can be interpreted in any way, depending on the individual readers personal knowledge. The more you learn, the more meanings will apply themselves to FW. Tip.And those of you who call this book a piece of garbage have to admit one thing- at least it's original and unique. There's no other book quite like it. Joyce didn't write for other people to understand him. He didn't write to appeal to the literary elite. Joyce wrote for Joyce, and if the reader can be in on the joke, it can produce great results. If you don't get it and call it a pretentious collection of random phrases, then darn it, it's your loss. And don't criticize people for saying they like it. And no, I'm NOT &quot;pretending&quot; to like it- I LIKE IT! Certainly it has some dull spots, but it's 90% great!It Awnly tuck me sicksweex to reed the hole booke, anned I enjoid it vary moch. Tip. To you extramely pretentious revousers who say that knowbody has ever red it all the weigh thru (whaat maycs you so dammed shore of it in the fursed plays?!), then increase the number of people of all time who have read it all the way through from &quot;zero&quot; to ONE. That one being me. Not only did I read every last word, but I ENJOYED it, and very much so. So stack that in yore piep und smoe kit!On to bigger and better(?) things! I'm starting Ulysses tonight!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I've read all of Joyce's novels and short stories and have taken graduate courses featuring hours of seminar and discussion, so don't consider myself unqualified to cast an opinion. I must say though, that Joyce was having a bit of fun with his readers here. This is his endgame in which he outmaneuvers all other authors. Remember this is the same writer who prophesied, shortly after its publication by Shakespeare &amp; Co. that Ulysses would keep the academics guessing for 100 years (it will have them arguing a lot longer than that I'll wager).Well take Ulysses and multiply it to the tenth power and you will have some perspective of this Tower of Babel of a novel. Joyce wants to take you higher and higher up the tower steps until you become so disoriented you have no longer have any clue what speech or language signify (which is the primary reason it is one of the deconstructionists holy texts).If you will recall, Ulysses begins in a tower as well. Only here, the higher he takes you, the more you are overcome by vertigo as you peer down at the vestiges of culture and what you supposed was community below.Anyone who has seriously studied Joyce and has read his biographers (Edelman is my favorite, but Leon Edel also provides some sharp insights) is aware that few authors had a more colossal Ego than JJ. This work is the author's ego as edifice. Take the climb if you so desire. He will definitely not lead you by the hand, and the only thing you will see and hear when you get to the top are provided by your own inadequate sensory apparati. You might just get a whiff of your own sweat and mortality as well. If your eyes can still focus, you might also see JJ, bent over, laughing at you for having made the trip. I know, I thought he was a one-eyed SOB at that point too."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Im a first time reader of Finnegans Wake (a simple title you can interpret in at least four different ways). Along with FW Im reading Campbell's book &quot;A Skeleton Key to FW&quot; and while its not the optimal resource to totally understand Joyce's masterpiece, its been a big help so far. I recommend. There are too many levels to discuss here, so here's my advice- do not read FW if you want a quick read. Read it if you enjoy wordplay, like in ee cummings' poetry, or allegory, like in Dante's. Read it if you like comedy- many fail to mention FW is FUNNY. Read it if you like a mental challenge. Read it if you are Irish. Read it if you are not Irish. After FW you will chuck your TV out the window and never look back. Read it if you are sick of John Grisham and Stephen King and Oprah's Wet Noodle Book Club for The Grammatically Harmless."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The last work of his that Joyce ever saw published--the work he labored on for 17 years--is Finnegans Wake and easily one of the oddest books ever. Some people do get hostile towards the book, because it IS odd, but you have to appreciate Joyce's OTHER works the way I do to even want to read it. I can honestly say I don't get all of it--no one ever will. I don't think it's a book intended to be read just once.The one problem is that Joyce maybe got a tad out of hand. Okay, it was the book he probably wanted to be remembered for (although &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and maybe &quot;Ulysses&quot; are more accessible and therefore get more readers today), but I think maybe he was showing off a bit. Not that he didn't have the right to.The first time I read a work by Joyce I figured I was going to hate him. When I hate an author, I really hate one. But somehow Joyce grew on me. That was pretty strange. And although I haven't read most of Joyce's stuff, I like to get in over my head--hence, reading Finnegans Wake.This is not a beginner's book, that's for sure. If you've heard of Joyce and want to explore his works, start with &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, because that is a classic all its own and also much easier to follow. Actually, I'd build even more than that before Finnegans Wake, but that's up to you.In all, I strongly suggest Finnegans Wake for people who like interesting literature."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OK, first of all, I can't help but notice that in many of the negative reviews of Finnegans Wake the reviewer admitted to &quot;not getting past the first page&quot; or some such thing. I think that anybody trying to read this book needs to realize that it's not nearly as difficult as it seems on first impression. You need to approach it with an open mind, though. Don't expect it to follow any familiar rules, and don't feel lost when it doesn't. People who couldn't get past the first few pages probably let their biases of what a novel &quot;should be&quot; interfere with their enjoyment of the book.Example: I just started reading FW for the first time, and I'm about halfway through it. So far I've enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm also a 17 year old senior in high school. I don't have the background to understand many of Joyce's allusions, I only speak two (English and Spanish) of the sixty languages he uses. But I still understand enough to know that I like what I'm reading. And even when I don't understand, it doesn't matter - simply the sound of the language is enjoyable. &quot;As we there are where are we are we there from tomtittot to teetootomtotalitarian. Tea tea too oo.&quot; What the hell does that mean? Who knows! But it doesn't matter, it rocks!The point is that with an open mind and occasional extra research, I've gotten something out of Finnegans Wake. I know I haven't even scratched the surface, but it just goes to show that as inaccessible as this book may seem, there is something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The last and most bizarre of Joyce's works, Finnegans Wake is considered by many to be the ultimate in inaccessible literature. I've read the book in its entirety, and admittedly, I don't know what it's supposed to &quot;mean&quot;. In spite of all the critical commentary that's been published on it in the last 60 years, it's likely that no one knows what Joyce was really getting at. The book is written in a language of humorous puns and exotic coinages which tends to obscure what little &quot;plot&quot; there is. Several central personalities keep resurfacing: HCE, the father; ALP, the long-suffering mother; Shem and Shaun, the brothers who are polar opposites; and Issy, the daughter. These &quot;characters&quot; are shown in various situations: playing games, getting drunk, doing schoolwork, etc. Sometimes they are identified with personages from legends or history: Tristan and Isolde, Adam and Eve, and so on. Some readers have interpreted the book as being Joyce's autobiography, or as a kind of heretical Bible (given the author's antipathy to Irish Catholicism). Needless to say, this is not the sort of book that most people will want as a little light summer reading. But it rewards the diligent reader who is willing to enjoy and puzzle over the linguistic experiments that Joyce set up."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book was obviously written by a man with a patch over his eye. You see, it's a book comprised solely of footnotes to footnotes. The great thing about it is you don't really have to read it to have an opinion about it! I've read far more words about the book than I've read in the book! My girlfriend worked in the Fredonia (SUNY) Library where they had 30 feet worth of shelf space for the James Joyce Quarterly. More amazing than the book itself is the serious time and effort others have dedicated to it. I'd spend hours reading 10,000 word essays on a new interpretation of the meaning of a three word sentence in the Wake! A former girlfriend once said he wrote it to make scholars talk baby talk for 1,000 years...another friend joked that, to receive his BA at Utica College, he was going to write THE DEFINITIVE ESSAY on Finnegans Wake. Of course this can't be done. Approach the book the way you would a dream, with suspended disbelief. You know how in a dream nothing is questioned, no matter how surreal? (I have a friend who dreams 'ordinary' dreams, which seems odd to me.) - Read the book aloud, and with an Irish accent. Don't strain to &quot;get&quot; what it is you're reading (think in terms of Jazz/John Coltrane/sheetsofmusic), and Most importantly have a bellyfull of beer. The best time to read it is for an audience at an afterhours party (4AM) when everyone is pretty zonked out and there are a few people there whom you've never met before and will in all likelyhood never meet again. Open the book randomly and read aloud for a page or two (if possible), then continue with the party as if you've done nothing out of the ordinary. (Interestingly, the usual reaction to this is complete indifference, as if it never happened!- but I suspect years later it'll occure to them that something odd happened for a moment during those parties. A delayed response? Or was it just a dream? How much can you trust your memory?)...Finally, a reviewer somewhere below got it right when he said Joyce shows promise.

Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO \\"stupid.\\" I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has \\"got it\\" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy.

One cannot so much \\"read\\" this novel as study it, or at best re-read it. The most pleasing surprise of FW is that spread out among passages that are difficult and abstruse there are other passages that are surprisingly beautiful in their lyrical quality. When one comes across such passages, we realize that FW is a typological work, a landscape that quickly changes (really a seascape, since the transformations are more like bodies of water flowing into other bodies of water). For the casual reader, not interested in parsing every pun and allusion, this is the best way to approach this novel. Read it and allow yourself to flow with the stream of language. Understand that nothing exists but language here, that the language has no REAL representation, and amazing things being to happen. The very act of reading is transformed."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The Wake is reviewed by so many people who haven't read it!How can anyone familiar with Joseph Campbell's Wings of Art or Skeleton Key, or even John Bishop's Joyce's Book of the Dark, suggest that the Wake is not great art?The greatest novelist of the twentieth century did not spend seventeen of his most creative years on a prank. Joyce had a flair for foreign languages, regarded Catholicism as \\"a beautiful lie\\", had at his disposal the collective wisdom of East and West, was *extremely* well read, gifted in music, delighted in wordplay, extensively researched the psychology of sleep, and was notoriously autobiographical in his literary productions.Joyce describes a night's dream in both biographical (Freudian) and archetypal (Jungian) terms: Brother against brother conflict, inevitable haunting guilt (\\"this municipal sin business\\"), raging lust percolating through \\"the fury and the mire of human veins\\", chrysalis-like psychological dependence on (temporal and ecclesiastical) authority, ultimate redemption through love, inevitable death. These motifs characterize both human history and tomorrow morning's news. And so, the Wake is *our* dream: Each of us is the poor harried protagonist Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, subjected to the cold patrician ridicule of the Four Customers and Twelve Jurymen and burdened by guilt and the misplaced faith of our personal and collective innocence.Those with little patience for Joyce's presentation are not willing to reassess what a book should convey or else lack a herculean desire for wordplay. In defence of detractors, knowledge of at least one foreign language probably helps, as does general knowledge of comparative religion and mythology, Vico's historical cycles, Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, alchemy, Biblical tales, children's games, the history of English literature, etc. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to approaching the Wake is that many readers come in bad faith, unwilling to believe that an order is there, hidden in the obscure labyrinth of protean wordplay.If you want to turn the lead of the Wake into gold, then you must be a modern-day alchemist. And do not expect to complete the Great Work without much meditation and effort."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"an ineluctable trasmission of the incommodious"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I tought dis was claaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssssssssssss!!

When, for that infinite instant, you connect to the unveiled phallus of divinity and in that harsh omnipotent instant ecstasy become nothing that is nevertheless something. On the graphic stage, the rudimentary marks of letters become the defined ingeniousness of language in cascading momentum to incontrovertible self-expression (another Grail Quest doomed to failure in the physical pursuit).The permutations of word in letter, phrase, and text provide the hit and miss of the Perfect Word (that makes both cosmos and chaos-\`Chaosmos') in embryo. The Perfect Word being ever unspoken (and conversely: ever-spoken-and thus hidden in infinite division) is illiterate because it is both before and after language. Swollen and glowing clandestinely with the enticement (the promise) of the literary, the inner illiterate scythes into sensibility a billion cuts of unexpressible feeling, which are the pangs of death, the noumena of being outside of being. The embryo-illiterate is the anti-saviour (though still Saviour) of sentience, immolating intellect upon the searing combustibility of antithetical mindlessness.So words become emblems (thus amorphic and undefinable, and are shown so through ingenious distortion to dis-acculturate). And metaphors are a joke on reality as a serious world view. Thus the text is a profound banality (as a fem-divine response to the ego-emperor of vain-glory), showing nothing, giving nothing except that which is sublime in the experience of the reading as a vocal phenomenon-a reckless (and thus potentially poignant) abandonment in intonation and rhythm. Thus is the stuff of magic. And so the soul (in its aspect of the nullity of the literate-illiterate combustion) is set free of convention and the stereotypes of communication (and, consequently, monosyllabic being). The words and text fall not then on culturally limited perception but rather on reception-it is what it is, judge not, and transformation-transfiguration through cadent text brings reader to eternal fem-orgasm of the unravelled soul, and thus redemption from the Fall that words as mind-memes concrete us to (ie, harsh homo-divine eroticism)."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"&quot;Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou.&quot; You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce.

Anyone could have done it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I firmly believe that most who have read -- or so they say -- &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; extoll its virtues because, to coin a phrase, its reputation precludes it. I am only aware of one detractor: Vladimir Nabokov, who, while considering &quot;Ulysses&quot; one of the four greatest works of the 20th century (a view which I don't share, incidentally), described labelled &quot;FW&quot; only a blot on his memory. (Note: not offered as a proof.) What is &quot;FW&quot;, what is it really? Ultimately, I declaim it a failure -- not because I don't like it (an understatement!), but a failure on its OWN terms; and these, after all, are the only terms which any given work of art is obligated to fulfill. I offer one example of this failure -- an example which, however, is crucial to the entire structure of the book. &quot;FW&quot; is, within the story (such as it is) of one man, one family, supposed to represent the history of all of humankind. The history, of course, is relatively easy to represent, with its contextual Vico-ian circularity &amp;c.; but the humankind is a foundering point (no pun intended). Joyce portrays this omnium gatherum of humanity through the meduim of what is commonly referred to as &quot;dream consciousness,&quot; the collective unconscious of history, and he exemplifies this through a gallimaufry of languanges: all people, all languages. Fine, makes sense. And it also makes sense that there is a predominant language: English (alright: a very broguish Irish-English), because Finnegan/Humphrey/et al. is/are Irish. But we've glossed over the problem: all people, NOT all languages. Joyce, while being a brilliant linguist, didn't remotely have even snippets -- or even a good percentage -- of all of the languages extant (never mind those of antiquity); and while I'm perfectly willing to accept that NO ONE could have the languages to pull off this idea properly, that does nothing to the fact that Joyce fails to successfully complete his endeavor (on this front). I don't care if Michael Johnson is (currently, at least) the world's fastest 200 meter runner: if he promises a 15-sec. performance and runs it in 19, he's failed to deliver, period! Joyce's idea here IS possible: since there are certainly a finite number of languages, it would be quite possible to represent them all within one book, even if not humanly possible. What Joyce does, though, is make a helluva LOT of languages stand in for ALL languages. Weak, very.There's a lot more wrong with &quot;FW&quot;, too. For example, in a great many of his neojoylogisms, Joyce conveniently ignores the possible readings of his recombinations -- and subsequently asks the reader to do so. Joyce, the control freak, is not in complete control, his words come back to haunt him. (I don't say this is all the time, but . . .)And I haven't even gotten to my tag line: the ultimate one-trick pony. (Okay: a couple of tricks.) &quot;FW&quot; is nothing more than a collection of erstwhile fables and puns, served up with the aforementioned linguistic salad (vide supra for the implicative failures of the latter). There's nothing to probe beneath this rococo surface, only the unscrambling and decoding. Recirculation of history? That can be probed in a paragrpah or two, perhaps a pair of pages. What else? Does Joyce score points of originality? Of course! Ambition? O my! But how long before different manifestations of HCE gets old? Just because Joyce's allegories are bigger must we pretend he came up with the idea? Ad rem ad nauseum.If you love Joyce's writing (and I never much do) here, fine. Perhaps you'll find his puns amusing, his tales compelling. Certainly his workmanship is impressive -- I don't care how short it ultimately measures up. To me, &quot;FW&quot; is a crucible of Joyce's elementary particles, his three flavors of quark -- patience, knowledge, and ego. But I suspect that this book is little above what could be produced by a later series of HAL if you fed it enough information and a rather simple list of specifications. No computer could approach &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, or &quot;Arcadia&quot; -- or &quot;Ulysses&quot;, for that matter; but &quot;FW&quot; does so few things (instead simply doing them over and over and over and over (okay, perhaps that's somewhat fitting), changing the players but never the play) that it seems little more than the work of a machine, so contained is the arc of creativity which subsumes the various recombinatives. Madelbrot sets produce something similar, although with infinite (as far as we know) variety. I give it a 6: one above average for all that hard work.

In shock, she can't believe her eyes when she also sees a young boy run from the basket. The questions mount up when she learns that Randy has had a vasectomy, an unpleasant surprise since they had hoped to have children together. Unsure of what to do with herself now that her dreams of having a family are shattered, Pauly retreats to live with her Gram, a five-time married owner of a carnival. There she meets Steve, a tattooed snake handler to whom she feels inappropriate feelings of lust. Soon Pauly discovers that she didn't know Randy at all, as she inherits from him not only his partnership in his hydrolics business but millions in money that he shouldn't have had. The more she learns about him the more she begins to believe that he was deliberately murdered, and the circle of those she can trust tightens. It seems that everyone around her has been keeping secrets, including her own beloved grandmother. Still feeling protective of Randy and not knowing whom she can trust, Pauly chooses not to reveal all of her suspicions to the police or those around her. Eventually Pauly gets herself mixed up in a dispute over water rights, child pornography, and, of course, murder.In her second standalone mystery (departing from her Ben Pecos series), Slater again creates a beautiful setting in New Mexico. She succeeds in creating characters that are as real as they are unusual, and Pauly is both entertaining to watch and admirable in her courage. At times she's a little too dominated by her hormonal lusts for Steve, but Pauly's feelings of isolation as those around her continue to deceive her are believably played out. Despite the shocking beginning, this is not a morose mystery and the reader can appreciate Pauly's wit and how regains her strength and refuses to let herself be manipulated by others. Slater has created yet another winning mystery."},{"Title":"Five O'Clock Shadow (Dan Mahoney Mysteries)","review":"I really enjoyed the outline of the story as laid out in the book jacket -- it had such potential!

And did Pauly just imagine she saw a little boy running away from the balloon, wearing nothing but her dead husbands jacket?The plot twists and turns on every page as Pauly keeps learning more about her dead husband. Why didn't he tell her about his vasectomy? What are those mysterious papers in his bank safe? What's real and what isn't? Who's on her side and who's against her? And why?Amazingly, author Slater manages to come up with a consistent explanation. She treads a fine line between legitimate red herrngs that distract the reader and sleight of hand that leads the reader to cry, \\"Foul!\\"This mystery is plot-driven with a heroine who's likeable but not strong enough to carry a series. As she says herself, Pauly held only a few nondescript jobs before marrying the ill-fated Randy. She had been a technical writer but doesn't use this background to solve the mystery. In all fairness, her dead husband's partners are right to question her involvement in their business. All she has going for her is a fierce determination to find out who she really married -- and why he wanted to marry so badly.But while you're reading, if you're like me, you won't notice the absence of character development. You'll be too busy turning the pages to find out whodunit and why. And you won't be a bit surprised by the romantic subplot."},{"Title":"Five O'Clock Shadow (Dan Mahoney Mysteries)","review":"Between a recent widow lusting after every man she meets, terrible dialogue and absurd characters, I could not get through this book."},{"Title":"Five O'Clock Shadow (Dan Mahoney Mysteries)","review":"The storyline is interesting, but the writing was not as engaging as The Pumkin Seed Massacre. Characters were developed in a sort of choppy way. I felt disappointed, having read a number of her opther books."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly has long been one of my favorite authors; I am a huge fan of his Harry Bosch series. In The Lincoln Lawyer Connelly broadens his range by writing his first legal thriller and it is a damn good one.Mickey Haller is the son of a lawyer who was a legend in the field. Although his father died when he was young Mickey has read many of his books and takes to heart his adage: \\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you f*** up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.\\"When Mickey is hired to defend Louis Roulet in an assault and rape case he begins to think he may have actually found the proverbial innocent man. Soon his investigation turns up a dark side to Roulet and Mickey finds he has some ethical choices to make.This book is, as usual, well written, tightly plotted and fast paced. In Mickey Haller we have another great protagonist - a basically decent guy with a few issues, who isn't above bending the law to achieve his goals. This is a great new character and I am looking forward to The Brass Verdict where Haller meets Bosch. That should be another winner."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"If you're looking for a worthwhile suspenseful mystery story, you've found it! The Lincoln Lawyer will keep you guessing till the very last page!I am a huge fan of Michael Connelly, of course a big Harry Bosch fan. I have to say that Mickey Haller is a pretty great character as well (I just got done reading Brass Verdict). As always a very entertaining story, keeps your interest the entire way until the surprise ending.Well done!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Geeze, how lawyer fiction has changed from those days!And now that we're in the age of John Grisham and Scott Turow, Michael Connelly tries his hand at writing a legal thriller and succeeds once again in rewarding the reader with a novel that hits at the gut level. Connelly is not easy on his characters. They make mistakes, act on wrong assumptions, and bring about tragic consequences and then have to live with themselves.This is Connelly at the top of his form bringing us a new central character we hope to see more of. Mickey Haller does of course return in THE BRASS VERDICT and hopefully will continue as a periodic lead character.I'm not going to go into the story because that has been adequately covered by other reviewers. I do however recommend this as a book that hits as I've already said at the gut level, but also at the cerebral level. I don't think this is a book you'll forget nor will you regret having read it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"With Michael Connelly's THE LINCOLN LAWYER we get a good story, good plotting, good and not so good bad guys and an occasional really, really bad guy. It is a good book for a long or even semi-long commute, a bedtime read or for a lazy Sunday over coffee. It is also a book that a few other 'best selling' authors could learn from in terms of character development,style and substance.Connelly is a suspense Master in the making and it's fun to watch him build his craft. So what's the book about? About 404 well-written pages.Sorry, but I hate it when someone ruins the storyline before we have a chance to enjoy it for ourselves. Here's hoping Hollywood will do it justice."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read a lot of novels...many of Connolly's Harry Bosch novels too.This book grabs you and doesn't let go. The main character is fun to listen to and be around then plot and characters are really compelling. One of the best novels I've read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book is great! It's a murder mystery within a courtroom drama, and both parts are well written and developed.I loved the fact the the main character, Micky Haller, is just like a few lawyers I know, out for the BIG Case and the BIG Buck, but generally a good person when it comes down to it.Even if you figure out (or think you have it figured out) who the killer is, the court scenes will keep your interest to the very end.I look forward to reading more of the main character in future books."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Reading the excellent The Brass Verdict reminded me that I had never read this first Mickey Haller story, so I started this the day after I finished Verdict (which I loved) and couldn't put it down either. From the twists and turns that I never saw coming to the shocking end, Connelly is one of, if not the, best mystery writers around. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Being a retired cop, I don't normally like stories about defense attorneys; however, when the sequel to the book \\"The Brass Verdict\\" came out I wanted to catch up on the series. This is an outstanding profile of the inequities in the Criminal Justice System and is right on target. Michael Connelly is a great writer who researches his material. This book and it's sequel were hard to put down. I am now hooked on our new lawyer hero who makes no bones about how the system is manipulated and guilt or innocence has absolutely nothing to do with the verdict."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a review of the Audio Book. It was a little boring at first, but it quickly got interesting. The narrator does an excellent job - the characters are easily distinguished without over-doing it. This is the first book by Michael Connelly I have listened to, and I plan on listening/reading to more.Normally I listen to these on my lunch break, and get through 1 hr a day. This one was an exception - I started Sunday and had to finish it Monday. I really did not want to put this down. One thing I also appreciated was the limited use of language and sex.I won't get into the plot because other reviews have already done it a lot better than I could."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is not your ordinary attorney. He isn't sitting at his desk waiting for clients to approach him. Mickey is driven around in his Lincoln Town Car and usually drums up a little business along the way. His clients are mostly on the seedy side and they too, are usually driving around town.Although Mickey's father was a respected attorney, Mickey receives little respect from his colleagues. They know that most of his clients are the scum of society. They are repeat offenders and often people who have no desire to stay on the right side of the law. This is the story of a lawyer who deals mostly with customers who are probably guilty, but need an attorney to get them through the trial. Mickey knows that the most terrifying client he can ever have is the innocent one, because he will really have to defend him and not just make a deal! Seems like Mickey might just be facing that dilemma.Mickey Haller is an intricate and interesting character. It was fun to get into his head and he's someone worth meeting again in another of Connelly's stories!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Top Notch Courtroom SkillsOff the top of your head, what's the most despicable profession you can think of in this day and age? Lawyer, right? But, not just any lawyer--a criminal defense lawyer. Especially one like Mickey Haller. Mickey's liberal lawyering ethics--ethics being loosely applied to our protagonist--slap you in the face from the get-go. And he's more than proud of it, having come from a family of lawyers, his deceased legendary daddy having defended the worst of the worse in gangster Mickey Cohen.Mickey Haller defends the creepiest dregs of society--drug dealers, women beaters, motorcycle-gang thugs, murderers. All guilty of the crimes they've been accused. But hey--Mickey's there to defend their constitutional rights--provide them with the best their money can afford. His job is to find any glitch in their arrest, neutralize the evidence, twist the actions of the district attorney's office state-subscribed role as prosecutorial litigator so that the jury sees horns on the victim, the criminal perpetrator winged.But Mickey's daddy wrote in one of his famous books--as a criminal lawyer, the one person you don't want to defend is the one who is innocent of the crime he's accused. Along comes Louis Roulet, the first \\"franchise\\" client Haller's ever had. That's a client who's able and willing to pay the \\"A\\" list fees, up front. And Haller quickly discovers, not only up front, but personal. Very personal. Is it possible a lawyer, mired deeply in bending the legal system to benefit the bad guys, can redeem himself?Michael Connelly, keeping with his dark-charactered protagonists, has penned a Harry Bosch antithesis. Bosch a stickler for the law; Haller a sticky lawyer. One thing the two have in common--trouble with the women they love. I for one hope Mr. Connelly keeps going with this character and has him climbing up the ethics ladder to a higher plateau."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Given Connelly's background and previous courtroom scenes (Concrete Blond and A Darkness More Than Light) it shouldn't surprise anyone that he's done a superb job with presenting a \\"likeable\\" defense attorney. While Connelly does take some license with criminal procedure, it is still a very realistic (and entertaining) account of the criminal justice system.Adam Grupper performance brings it all together for a great audio book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"What I found to be most intriguing is the way Connelly handles with great mastery, the deep character development of Mickey Haller, the story's protagonist, and how Haller navigates the thru the world of the justice system. Though there are several liberal takes on the ethic issues lawyers face, overall the execution of Haller portraying a middle-age man wondering and questioning the system he is a part of is excellent. Clearly, Connelly's opinion that there are many grays to the best legal system is well presented, and provides readers the opportunity to reflect upon our legal system.Readers will thoroughly enjoy this story of twists and turns, as Connelly takes us thru the Los Angeles legal system. Overall, this is an excellent story. Michael Connelly has just found another reader who will devour his past written books."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a pretty good page turner with excellent characters. Michael Connelly always tells an interesting story and makes the lead characters very relatable one way or the other. So, probably an average Michael Connelly novel, and overall a good read for the suspense/mystery genre."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a defense attorney who runs from case to case trying to make as much money as possible and put in a decent defense for his clients in the process. One day he is asked to defend a very rich young man from Beverly Hills who supposedly assaulted a prostitute. At first he is convinced that this Louis Roulet is innocent, but bit by bit he finds out that Louis is not only guilty, but also related to another case in which he defended the suspect. This brings Mickey into a very difficult position: any information he has on Louis is confidential, but on the other hand he wants to make sure that an innocent man has justice done. Together with his investigator he tries to pull off a stunt that may cost him his career and his life...Michael Connelly, the \\"father\\" of detective Harry Bosch, has moved from police procedurals to legal thrillers and although the American system of justice is completely different from the Dutch system (and in our view often completely incomprehensible and unfair), this book has all the elements of a roller coaster: regular action scenes are intertwined with research and investigation and court scenes. I really enjoyed the book, but I am missing Harry..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When I picked this book up and started to read the first chapter, it pulled me right in and soon I almost couldn't put it down. This is the first book by Michael Connelly that I've read and I was very impressed by his writing style.However, I guess I was expecting a *whodunnit* story, so my first disappointment was the revelation of the real *bad guy* very early on in the story. But this could be considered a *personal* disappointment; just because I was thinking this book would be a *whodunnit* mystery, by no means reflects on the story being interesting and well written.My second (more significant) disappointment was the last few chapters, wherein it seemed like the author was *rushing* to finish the story, hastily tying things up. Mr. Connelly had taken his time presenting a detailed and vivid insight into the legal system and Louis Roulet's odyssey through it, yet the last few chapters seemed forced in what seemed to me to be an abrupt conclusion.(I now plan to read the first in Michael Connelly's *Harry Bosch* detective series, for which he is well-known, to get a feel for the *Harry Bosch* character, the series, and how The Lincoln Lawyer compares and/or contrasts with *Harry Bosch*!)"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the first Michael Connelly novel that I have read. I highly recommend this novel. It keeps you guessing until the ending which has a really big surprise!!I thoroughly enjoyed this novel from beginning to end. If you love a good mystery thriller mixed with the courtroom then you will love this book. This book has made me want to go get more of his novels!!! Definitely FIVE stars!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly taking a break from his Harry Bosch series, crafts a superb and taut legal drama starring L.A. criminal defense attorney Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller, who conducts much of his business from the back seat of a Lincoln Town Car. Haller, a twice divorced father of a young daughter is a shark using his large yellow page ads to attract a wide variety of unsavory clients, who he defends so long as they can pay his fees. Haller whose father was also a renowned defense attorney receives a heads up from a bail bondsman illegally on his payroll named Valenzuela about a potential client.The client was Louis Ross Roulet, a young Beverly Hills real estate agent working in his mothers very high profile firm. Roulet had been charged with the brutal beating of a young woman in her apartment. Roulet's case combined with his mother's financial background portended enormous potential to be a \\"franchise case\\", a massive moneymaker. Roulet was so convincing in his repudiation of the charges that Haller actually believed him innocent and would have an easy time defending him.Haller utilizing an ex-LAPD cop Raul Levin as an investigator began turning up evidence that painted a more devious and sociopathic picture of the apparently reserved Roulet. It turned out that Roulet had a penchant for cruising clubs and partying with prostitutes, which was his victim Regina Campo's occupation. While a surveillance video in the club they met suggested that she initiated the interaction with Roulet, Haller began having serious doubts.Some time prior to this case Haller defended a Jesus Menendez in a pro bono case for the murder of a prostitute, Martha Renteria. Menendez, a poor, semi literate Hispanic outbid another potential john for Renteria's services using a wad of illegal drug money, a gift from his brother. When she wound up dead despite a preponderence of evidence corroborating his innocence Menendez's DNA was found on a towel in the dead girl's apartment. Haller, now with deep feelings of guilt, had advised Menendez to accept a plea bargain which meant hard time in the maximum security San Quentin. Now Haller noticed that Renteria and Roulet's alleged victim Campo looked strikingly similar in appearance. He also suspected that the outbid suitor was none other than Roulet.When confronted by Haller with this, Roulet who had broken into Haller's house, admitted that it was he that killed Renteria confident of the attorney client privilege. Haller now really had a dilemma which was heightened when his investigator Levin turned up dead, killed at home by gunshot. Haller who had a gun handed down to him from his father, a present from notorious L.A. gangster Mickey Cohen, found it missing. When he was questioned by detectives about Levin's killing he became aware that the murder weapon was thought to be the same type of gun. Roulet had stolen it from him and presumably used it.Roulet now had Haller in a compromising position of having to defend him to the best of his ability and get him off or he would introduce the gun as evidence. When Roulet also threatened Haller's daughter Hayley and ex-wife Maggie, a prosecutor, he had had enough and conspired to legally turn the tables on Roulet.Connelly did an excellent job in creating a plot that was loaded with surprising twists, a result of legal technicalites that propelled his protagonist to take decisive action while having the sanctity of his personal and professional life threatened. Connelly, a journalist by trade shows a great working knowledge of the machinations of the legal system in this compelling drama which he concluded in unexpected fashion."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Loved this book as I love all John Grisham books.

I just couldn't get past the basic premise that paints a defense lawyer from a jaded cop's perspective. I've known hundreds of defense lawyers, a few of them pretty sleazy, but no one's really like the protagonist of this book. It's such a false stereotype. I kept on trying to get past it, but just couldn't. A big disappointment for my first attempt at Connelly.

This publisher needs to face reality."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"SPOILER WARNING. On page 79, a character uses the word \\"faggots.\\" This \\"homophobic\\" comment gives away the ending of the novel, in the tiresome style of the cop shows on television.In nearly every episode of a TV cop show, the ending is given away by a propagandistic clue that is as subtle as a nightstick. The clue takes either of two standard forms:(1) A character is \\"politically incorrect.\\" For example, he's a \\"racist,\\" a \\"sexist,\\" a \\"homophobe,\\" a rich white businessman, a cigarette smoker, a gun owner, or a user of correct English grammar. Guilty.(2) A character asked to \\"cooperate\\" with the police fails to become instantly servile. For example, an office manager abruptly asked to hand over the personnel files of all employees in the company responds politely, \\"Let me just check first with our company lawyer.\\" Guilty.We expect such craven awkwardness from television writers; we don't expect it from novelists.I have read every Michael Connelly novel published so far; I don't plan to read any more. If Mr. Connelly is willing to give away his own ending in order to make a silly ideological gesture, then I infer that he no longer cares to aim his books at intelligent readers."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"THE AUTHER IS VERY GOOD IN HIS OTHER BOOKS BUT THIS ONE WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AFTER 2 CHAPTERS IT WAS TRASH"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"While I began to read this as a \\"curl up with a cup of tea, cat on my lap\\" escapist mystery, I found myself stopping to muse over questions of guilt and innocence, the role of personal wealth vis-a-vis the legal system, and other rather philosophical questions.

I was quite disappointed in the quality of the editing. I noticed several punctuation mistakes and the occasional misspelling.

It was rushed and unclear at the end. At one point I also noticed a lack of continuity in the locations in the story. It was a bit of a shame because this has the makings of a good book.

As critics have noted, we interpret authors based upon our experience, and we anticipate special endearing quirks. This is certainly the case with Connelly's Bosch. In the last two novels he has been tangling Bosch's past and present, ex-wife and lover, child and other children in an interesting knot with his earliest novels as if attempting a restart. NOW, the author has taken elements of that L.A. world, the courts, the cops and the various municipalities and knitted them into a new pattern and character : his Lincoln LAwyer - so named for his mobile office in a Lincoln. It's one of a fleet he bought with a fat check and stores in a warehouse. Riding from venue to venue he prepares his cases, hoping for the \\"franchise case,\\" desiring to be the rainmaker as Grisham so eloquently named this species, and just as he seems to have achieved his fortune, he finds he is the victim of a trap laid in revenge for a previous failure. Questions of conscience, culpability, past and present set him and the reader up for a series of surorises and reversals I haven't seen since the movie \\"The Sting.\\" The reader is invited by the results to consider the multiple angles from which a substantial legal settlement/fees may be envisioned. If you are a Connelly fan - this is an enjoyable continuation, if you wanted to read his work but were afraid of the series, this is a new start and one which promises to have a long run - get aboard now."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Everyone's first question about this book will be: how does it stand up to the Harry Bosch novels?Heave a sigh of relief. Connelly is simply a wonderful writer, perhaps the best writer of thrillers today. \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" may not be a Harry Bosch novel, but it's enthralling nevertheless.The main character, Haller, is a lawyer. Naturally, your first worry is that this is one of those ghastly lawyer books which glut the marketplace, the kind (usually written by a lawyer) where the noble, handsome, brilliant lawyer risks his life to save his innocent client from the death chamber.Connelly turns everything upside down. His main character knows his clients are guilty. His one real fear is that he might actually stumble across an innocent client.

It gave me a fresh prospective.Mickey Haller is a character that is intelligent, street wise, witty and very likeable. I hope to see him again.

Like Cassie Black (for you Void Moon fans), this is a character that deserves to appear in future stories."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I recently aquiredthis book at the Sholastic bookfair held at the school where I teach. I had never heard of Michael Connelly before, but decided to pick it up. Once I started reading I could not put it down. The ending was a surprise. I am going to purchase more of his writing. He is right up there with Patterson."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I got this book unabridged on CD. I would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects. My wife and I usually have our own books that we'll read together, but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too, even though she wasn't listening to it to begin with. Upon discovering I had listened to some without her, my wife was like, \\"what? You listened to it without me?!\\" My response was, \\"I didn't even think you were listening to it.\\" That's how hooked you can get on this story.The Lincoln Lawyer follows the story of Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney whose personal life is teetering. He finally gets a break at work when the perfect case falls into lap. The client is called \\"the franchise\\" due to the fact that he's a high-roller who pays well, and more importantly on-time. As the case continues, Mickey starts to detect red flags as his client doesn't seem all that trustworthy. It reaches a crescendo when a good friend of his murdered while working on the case.This book isn't good because of plot. In fact I found the plot to be pretty cut-and-dry: Man gets mysterious client, client turns out crooked, story turns into a big whodunit, blah, blah, blah. This book is good because of the writing. It's both intelligent and believable. You really start to gravitate towards the characters because each has their own distinct personality. If there's any problem I have with the writing, it would have to the liberal use of the F-word. Do people actually use it that much in law? It made things feel more like a construction site. It may be there for shock value, but you'll get numb to it before you're even a third of the way through. All in all, an interesting read that will keep you up late saying, \\"just one more chapter.\\""},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Connelly really brings the characters to life. The farther into you get, the faster you want to turn the pages."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I loved this book. The pacing was perfect, the characters well-drawn, and the writing style engaging. Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns. He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker. The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read. This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is a great contemporary writer--glad I finally got around to him. Centered in L.A., the attorney-cum detective of sorts seems to get stuck with a franchise client who is nuts. We see the ways and workings of money-making attorney jock Mickey Haller. He's got two babes, both ex-wives, on the side who he works with or exchanges bits of legal wisdom and a true blue pal who serves as his fact-digger. Tipped off just a bit by state prosecuter, his ex-wife, who must recuse herself from the case -- Mickey gets the little edge he needs and he runs with it. His pal also provides some good stuff.Unfortunately, all is at a heavy cost to life and limb, and lawsuits flourish in the aftermath. Well researched. Nicely paced. Connelly worked with two real defense attorneys (who partner together to research this book), and he puts their names in the story as characters at the tail end. Looking forward to more of MC."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have had bad luck with crime stories lately and this was a welcome change. There is a plot within a plot but the characters remain in focus and the reader has no problems follwing the story. The author does not show his entire hand and the reader knows the central character has an ace up his sleave. But the reader in no way feels he's been had by having some of the plans withheld. I had to resist the urge to skip ahead and see how things turned out. I'm glad I didn't. This book is well worth reading. I don't give every book I read five stars. Four stars means a very good tale."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"There may be lawyer-client relationship stories that are as good as the Lincoln Lawyer, but there is none better. The characters and the scenes are vivid and the plot keeps you guessing and reading. The story has all the ingredients for an entertaining movie. If you like criminal lawyer stories, you will be delighted with this one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book had wonderful characters, a great plot, mystery, suspense and wonderful easy to read legal jargon that I enjoyed. This book was easy to read with short chapters (think james paterson) and kept me wanting to know what the ending will be. What a great storyline and I was hooked. I find the author has a sense of humor and it came out in his writing. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Let me first say how excited I am that the timing of my review comes on the heels of a (ridiculous) \\"one star\\" review for this great novel.The Lincoln Lawyer; by Michael Connelly is an excellent read from an author at the peak of his storytelling prowess. I have only previously read The Poet by Michael Connelly, though I have heard great things about his Harry Bosch series. I picked this novel up after reading some of the stellar reviews it has received. I am so happy that I did. The book is full of twists and turns and ethical dilemas over the justice system. I highly recommend this book. It is as good as anything John Grisham has done. In fact, Connelly has quickly established himself as one of the best authors in the legal thriller genre.A Strong 5 Star Novel."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have been a Connelly fan for a long time but this was really a great read. The legal system is what is really scary and this book even though it is fiction is so realistic. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As you know, I'm a sucker for free books. So when I saw an opportunity to put my name in the hat for one of several copies of the movie tie-in book or a poster of the just released film based on Michael Connelly's book, I did just that (chanting, \\"book, not poster; book, not poster\\" for several nights until I forgot about the drawing). Then my book (not poster) came and I just needed to find time to read.I was sure I'd like Connelly's writing (though I'd never read it before), and I was right. The Lincoln Lawyer is the first among the novels featuring defense pro Mickey Haller--a twice divorced, son of the star of all defense lawyers (who died when Mick was a boy, but left a legacy of courtroom sleight of hand to match Ben Matlock and Perry Mason).With the smell of dollars in the air, Haller engages a client who convinces him of total innocence in the murder alleged, and takes the case hoping for it to turn into a franchise (that is a big money-maker that keeps on giving for the foreseeable future). What he discovers is layer upon layer of deceit and pure evil. Mickey will be lucky to get out of this one with his life, let alone his attorney's license.Here's a fast-paced legal thriller that will have you guessing, reading, and rooting for the underdog. You might even want to run down and buy yourself a Lincoln Towne Car to run your office from (or start a Limo service, whichever seems most lucrative). I give the book 5 reading glasses and can't wait for the movie to hit DVD and Blue Ray so that I can get it into my queue.And by the way, the new paperback version includes a sneak peak at Connelly's newest best seller, The Fifth Witness (in stores now).--Benjamin Potter, May 3, 2011"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" was a stereotypical legal drama with a seasoned attorney, a client with a story that seems to good to be true, and a few surprises along the way. I enjoyed Michael Haller's character, which is summed up quite well in this statement from the book, \\"Much of society thought of me as the devil but they were wrong. I was a greasy angel.\\" That was an interesting way to describe all the legal maneuvers Haller goes through to defend his clients -- people that society would generally look down on.I thought the book did a good job of portraying the life of a defense attorney, and the story moved along at a good pace. I just didn't walk away from the book with anything more than being entertained, which is not necessarily a bad thing!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have always liked Connelly's work. His Bosch books are first-rate. This one starts with Connelly's usual flair and finesse, but falters, haltingly, after about one-third of the way. The plot becomes fairly predictable, and the \\"twists\\" are kind of forceful and strained, with the confluence of coincidences making \\"suspension of disbelief\\" unsustainable. Additionally, his courtroom stuff in this book, as in his others, is generally unconvincing.If Connelly wanted his hero to be a skilled trial lawyer, they both fail. As for the prosecutors/antagonists, they are mere foils who would not find work in a small burg in the middle of nowhere, not to mention a mayor city like Los Angeles ... oops, what am I saying? I take that back. The O.J. Simpson trial showed that Connelly's bumbling Los Angeles prosecutors are mirrors of reality. OK, I've gone up one star for that. All in all, what started out very well done, petered out page-by-page. Sad."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Characters are believable. You may not always like the central character. He is a defense attorney and uses the system to get minimum sentences or aquittal for his clients. It is his job. Plot was good and I thought the courtroom scenes very interesting. It actually reminded me of some of Grisham's earlier (I think better) works."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I didn't see the movie based on this book but was surprised by the bad reviews it got. How do you foul up this story? This is a good solid legal/suspense novel. Mickey is an engaging character and the plot contained a few nice touches and twists. Take the paperback to the beach this summer. Good entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a dirty-shirt criminal defense lawyer who cleans up well. He has a narrow life that is lived within the parameters of the criminal justice \\"machine\\". His friends are investigators, bail bondsmen, and other lawyers. His principal challenge is finding enough clients to enable him to make the mortgage payments and otherwise cope with the high cost of living in LA. That focus predisposes him to cut some ethical corners, ignore some people who should be more central to his life, and put aside questions about purpose and the higher good. It's all about the buck.The buck is all Mickey sees when he lands a wealthy client accused of assault and attempted rape. He worries that the case will be too easy, and his chance for a big score will evaporate in an early plea or a dismissal. However, that turns out not to be the case as Mickey's \\"franchise\\" client leads him through a troubling hall of mirrors that both continually distorts the truth and leaves Mickey staring at reflections of himself that he would rather not acknowledge.This novel is well written and imaginative, and contains some surprising plot twists. It also has some story elements that just don't hang together. There's no credible explanation for why exactly this case fell into Mickey's lap. The surprise climax left me saying, \\"aw, c'mon!\\" In the end, the solution was a lot short of what I stayed up until 3 in the morning hoping to see revealed.But then again, the story did keep me up reading until 3 in the morning. That doesn't happen often. Despite its flaws, this is a book to recommend."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a cool book, a hip, engaging tale about lawyers, criminals and the justice system. In my opinion, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is on par with the best of John Grisham's work, and that's saying a lot.Despite his flaws, Mickey Haller, the book's main character, is hard not to like. At heart he's a crafty, hardworking idealist, a guy who strongly believes in his work as a defense lawyer and standing up for the little guy. His views on the justice system aren't exactly cut and dry (and may not sound like they're coming from an idealist), but that's one of the things that make this such a great read. What some may view as cynicism regarding Haller's take on finding the meandering path to ultimate justice is just another day in the office for him. And speaking of his office, as Haller is chauffeured in his Lincoln vehicle from one important engagement to the next in Southern California, it's impossible not to get caught up in the attorney's fast-paced life among segments of society that most of us never see. The book centers around a client Haller is defending, but author Michael Connelly layers the story perfectly with other surrounding cases and dramas that keep things far from one dimensional.Another aspect I liked about \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is how it subtly respects or even champions the cast-off accused criminals, ethnic minorities and people different from mainstream society, without coming across as preachy or overly haughty. People are people when it comes down to it, and that's mostly how Haller lives his life when he's on the job. The book's gritty realism and topnotch plot -- interspersed with various surprises along the way -- make \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" a must-read if you like this kind of stuff.Can't wait to read \\"The Fifth Witness,\\" the next installment in the Mickey Haller series."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw that the movie version of this is set to come out so I wanted to give it a read before seeing the movie. I'm also a big John Grisham fan and this sounded similar to his style. As it turned out, I'm glad I took the opportunity to read it. This is actually the first Michael Connelly novel I've read but it won't be the last. Plenty of others have remarked on what the story is about so I won't waste time doing that. I will say that the book grips you early on and keeps you involved throughout. The lead character is interesting and has a great story which keeps you involved. I can see why Haller appears in other stories. I didn't think this novel was impossible to put down but I can say that I looked forward and enjoyed every time I picked it up to read. I finished the whole thing in about a week which is pretty good these days considering how little time I have to read. I recommend this book to any John Grisham or Scott Turow fan or anyone who just enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I enjoyed this novel, as most of Connelly books. I am a big fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series and I find that Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney is another character that is probably as engaging and exciting as Harry. Mickey's clients are often individuals who are unlucky and somehow are always on the wrong side of the law. The two protagonists Harry & Mickey concentrate two sides of the coin. One catches the guilty the guilty to provide justice for the victims and their families, whereas Mickey's defends those that have opposed the law."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelley is well known as a master of the police procedural. In \\"The Lincoln Lawyer,\\" he sets aside his very successful Harry Bosch character and instead focuses on Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney. Haller defends those most of us would consider lowlifes: drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, burglars, garden-variety murderers. No TV cameras or celebrity journalists after his story: just the day to day workings of affording the accused a defense against the power of the state.Haller doesn't lie for his clients. He doesn't want to know from them of their guilt or innocence. His focus is on defending them, working the system, insisting that the prosecution meet the heavy demands placed upon it.Mickey does most of his work from the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car. Nothing nefarious in that: Haller has cases to cover in the numerous courts in the Los Angeles area. Working from the backseat of a Lincoln is a good idea and it provides, if you'll forgive the expression, a perfect vehicle for Connelley's genius.One day, Haller gets the call his kind dream about: the possibility of a \\"franchise\\" case, a case that pays top fees and goes to trial. Haller is a bit puzzled because his client is the wealthy son of a wealthy real estate doyen and already has representation by a pricey, reputable civil lawyer. Mickey is the kind of guy who advertises on bus benches.Louis Roulet (\\"roo-lay,\\" you know) is accused of attacking a woman and threatening her with rape and murder. Within moments, Mickey Haller finds himself in a wonderland of ethics (yes, he has them), utter evil, ferretting out guilt and innocence and resolving his feelings about his ex-wife (who happens to be a prosecutor) and his young daughter.The pace is set high at the outset and never slows down. Haller is in for a harrowing, frightening roller coaster rideer Connelley keeps piling it on. The plot has more twists and turns then a mountain road and Connelley never falters once.Louis Roulet is pure evil, but as a criminal defense lawyer, Michael Haller is beholden to the system. The cops hate him; the prosecutors (except for his ex-wife) hate him. Mickey has his investigator, Raul Levin, and another ex-wife in his corner and a few other friends to call on.How Haller meets and defeats evil is the essence of Connelley's story and he tells it brilliantly. Definitely a different kind of legal thriller and a welcome breath of fresh air. Connelley is simply brilliant and \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a feast for the reader.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read Michael Connelly's books about Harry Bosch, and loved them all. I wasn't sure about him writing a book about a lawyer, wasn't sure if I wanted to read it or not. But I am so glad I did! I loved the characters, they seemed very real and easy to identify with right from the start - I actually cared about most of them. The book was easy to follow, yet there were twists and turns and a lot of excitement. I stayed up hours later than planned because I couldn't put it down at the end of a chapter.This book will be enjoyable even if you have never heard of Michael Connelly or read any of his books, it is a stand alone (but I hope he writes more book in the future with these characters!)."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" has rekindled my interest in the legal thriller. He may or may not have reinvented the legal thriller...but he certainly has refreshed it to an amazing degree and sets a new standard for the genre.The Lincoln lawyer of the title is Mickey Haller...so named because his office is his Lincoln Towncar tricked out with fax, phone, internet, folding desk and files. Chauffeured by a former client working off his fee, Mickey does business while commuting between the numerous court houses in Los Angeles.On the surface Mickey appears to be the stereotypical sleazy defense attorney. His two ex-wives and young daughter are still fond of him (wife number two is his case manager)...he does his share of pro bono work...and is fiercely honorable in his own way. So beneath the surface of the lawyer with bus bench advertising, whose clientele are hookers, drug dealers, scam artists and assorted LA lowlifes is a flawed and complex character.This practice provides a decent living (he has a home \\"with a million dollar view and a million one mortgage\\"), but not what the esteemed law firm pull down.His chance at the brass ring (the franchise client) turns up when a rich Beverly Hills real estate broker is pinched for attempted rape and murder. Mickey feels this may be an unusual client for him---an accused who is actually innocent. The fee is huge and the checks do not bounce.Naturally the case swerves in different directions and Mickey is compelled to reevaluate the veracity of his profession and the viable aspects of the law itself.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" has plenty of deduction and suspense, compelling ethical dilemmas, characters with depth and texture and razor sharp dialogue.Mr. Connelly draws precise portraits of the individuals and their motivations. Mickey's audacious scheme drives a slide rule perfect plot that leads to a turbulent climactic encounter followed by a stupefying revelation.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" proves that crime novels can be art. It deserves the careful reading its plot demands."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When I recently finished The Closers I was excited to see Bosch back and raved about the book. I rushed out and bought The Lincoln Lawyer and discovered this to be even better. Rarely do I finish a book in two days, but I literally couldn't put this one down. I haven't been this excited about a great book since Matthew Farrell's Winter Hill and Harlan Coden's The Innocent. Great Great Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's latest takes us on a more-than-suspenseful journey into the world of Mikey Haller; a sharp lawyer defending a man accused of attacking a woman he picked up in a bar.The fact that he is a rich playboy who gives Mikey his first monetarily fruitful case spurs the defense lawyer forward and soon he is embroiled in circumstances which make him contemplate a few things he hasn't thought of in years or maybe never contemplated...Guilt and Innocence.A prolific writer of detective novels, Connelly takes off in a new direction...and as usual his expertise and in-depth research catapult him to the top of the list.Court-room drama is his new venue and he produces a masterpiece which is truly a 'thinking mans' joy. His characters, some savory, some not; his plot, his inimitable prose, all add a special magic which propel the reader to the breath-taking conclusion.Mickey, his two ex-wives, his daughter, his friends..enemies...the judge...the police..ex-cons... all are so purely characterized that if they came to my door I would know them without introduction.I have read all of Michael Connelly's novels..and I have kept them all. Other books I have read and passed on to others. But Michaels I keep on a special shelf, in a special corner of a very special room dedicated to very special people. He is right next to my collection of first edition Pearl S. Buck novels. I discovered her 10 years ago and suppose it will take me the rest of my life to complete that collection. It pleases me to know she finally is next to an author who is of her caliber.This novel,LINCOLN LAWYER, is the best work yet of Connellys...it's smooth flow will hypnotize you from word one to the gut-wrenching final syllable. You will walk away a fan of one of today's most notable writers of great fiction."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's non-Bosch novels have won him critical acclaim, but I've always been more of a Harry fan to date. While titles like \\"The Poet\\" were excellent fiction, I felt that the characters were there more to drive a really cool plot idea than because they could stand on their feet. This may upset some people but I include Terry McCaleb in that camp. The protagonist of \\"The Lincoln Laywer\\" is different, with Mickey Haller I feel Connelly has created a character deep enough to rival Harry Bosch in terms of the empathetic connection possible between story and reader. Simply put, Haller is his best character in years.Excellent characterization is helped by one of Connelly's better plots in a while, and while the pacing is more gradual I think it's extremely well done. For long time readers of Bosch who have less to learn about the workings of the LAPD, Haller's existence in the lower realms of the criminal justice system provide a fascinating fictional education.An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a hard-working L.A. defense attorney. He's not the heroic type and his client list is made up almost entirely of druggies, prostitutes, and other small-time offenders. He's under no illusions that any of them are innocent, but it's his job -- as part of the legal machine -- to see that they get their chance to be judged not guilty. Or at least to ameliorate their sentences. Haller doesn't even maintain a real office, carrying on his practice in the back of his Lincoln Towncar while his driver (an ex-client working off his fee) conveys him from one courthouse or meeting place to another. Then a \\"franchise\\" client comes his way, a client with money whose case will keep paying and paying. Or so Mickey hopes. But Louis Roulet, charged with the attempted murder of a hooker, may be more than the lawyer can handle. Then again, Haller has been in the game a long time and no one in his right mind would underestimate him, not even in dealing with the defense attorney's nightmare -- the innocent client. This is a first-rate, thoroughly gripping, entirely convincing story about the law in the real world. This ain't Perry Mason. But Haller is the kind of lawyer you'd like to have on your side."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I never write book reviews, but this case is an exception. I felt compelled to let others experience the same joy I felt reading Michael Connolly's thrilling novel The Lincoln Lawyer. After 3 pages of this gripping drama you're hooked. I need not tell you what the book is about, many other reviews have already done so, all I'm here to do is make sure you do your self a favor and get this book! Only 5 stars doesn't do this book justice."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read a few of Connelly's Harry Bosch novels and enjoyed them. The Lincoln Lawyer is a large step away from those police procedurals. Connelly \\"switches sides\\" and writes from the point of view of a criminal defense lawyer. He does it very well.First, the reviews would have you believe that the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" is some sort of hack out-of-luck ne'er do well defense lawyer who is forced to work out of a car. That is not the case. This attorney bought four Lincolns for the fleet rate and is working through them 60,000 miles at a time. He is a good defense lawyer with an active practice named Mickey Hatcher who, by necessity, spends much of his day in his car.The plot is he gets hired by a rich real estate tycoon to defend him against murder charges. This is the franchise case - $60,000 retainer with prospects of more. However, Mickey is soon worried that the case is so easy that he'll have to refund a good part of the retainer. Alas and alack, there's to be no novel if all were as it first seems. The plot twists and turns and Mickey tries to maneuver and finesse things to get results he wants while not doing anything to get killed or disbarred.The characters are very good; especially Mickey and his ex-wife (#1). It is all the side characters and tangential yarns that Mickey spins that adds so much color to the book. Sprinkled through the main plot are all Hatcher's trips to the courthouses (in the Lincoln of course). This causes him to tell the reader about the clients, the crimes they have committed and how they got caught. This is a rich tapestry of L.A.'s criminal element told by someone viewing this world with the cold eye of a defense attorney deeply ensconced in the system. Weaving these tales throughout the book adds to the novel and separates it from a mere courtroom drama.This is an entertaining and enlightening book. Rarely are police mysteries or courtroom drama books so filled with everyday (unfortunately) accounts, entertainingly told, of crimes of every magnitude. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller, defense attorney in LA, has no office but is driven around town in a black Lincoln. Hence the name 'Lincoln Lawyer'. It is, in fact, his office. He defends all forms of low life including drug dealers and prostitutes.He is always on the lookout for a so-called franchise client- one who can pay a large legal fee and keep on coming back. He thinks he might have one when he is asked by a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate agent, Louis Roulet to defend him after Roulet is charged for the brutal beating of a prostitute. Haller agrees thinking of the huge payout. But, things start taking a turn for the worst when Roulet's connection to Haller might be much more than it ominously appears.The year 2005 is a fortuitous one for Mike Connolly fans. Two books out in the same year. Both are excellent. Mike has proven a modern master of the detective novel, police procedural, thriller and now legal thriller. The book is greatly detailed and much research has gone into it. There is great care taken in descriptions of the trial and, of course, there is the usual Connolly twist at the end. In spite of an unfortunate confession that really made no sense just before the onset of the trial, the reader will be treated to a realistic and carefully constructed tale and, as always, another must read of the year."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"If I had any gripe at all about Michael Connelly, it's that he needs to write more. Sure, he comes out with a book every nine months or so, and that may be considered prolific compared to other writers, but that still means I have to wait months between his books. And Michael Connelly is an author who is so good that you hate having to space out your reading of him. Ideally, he'd come out with a book a month without any sacrifice of quality; but that, of course, remains a dream.The Lincoln Lawyer is one of his standalone novels, that is, one that doesn't feature series character Harry Bosch. The narrator and protagonist of his book is Mickey Haller, a defense lawyer who operates out of his car (the Lincoln of the title). While being chauffeured around Los Angeles, he wheels and deals on behalf of his clients. Mickey is a good lawyer, but he often is more interested in money than real justice; he can represent his clients well, but he always wants the check to clear.For Mickey, Louis Roulet is a franchise case, one that promises a big heap of money. Roulet - accused of assault against a prostitute - may also be the one thing Mickey really fears: an innocent man. He knows that even when he normally loses, at least his clients are typically deserving of their fates; with an innocent man, however, a defeat condemns an undeserving man. Mickey's feelings will soon change, however, as he realizes that not only is Roulet guilty, but he is also a far more twisted man than he originally thought. Furthermore, Roulet is clever enough to cause some real ethical problems for Mickey.Connelly, an author who never seems to misfire, has again written an excellent book, one that has great characters and plotting and a healthy amount of suspense (with just a dash of humor). Among mystery writers, Connelly is in the very top tier, and the Lincoln Lawyer once again shows why he is there."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"With several hundred Amazon rave reviews, it seems overkill to add another, but what the heck: \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best. Connelly's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars (the drinking bars as well as the ones before which you conduct trials) borders on magic. The plot here is amazingly diabolical -- just when you think you know where it's going, Connelly pulls the rug away. Haller is a wonderful character, delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a (somewhat tarnished) heart of gold. I hope Connelly keeps bringing him back. But I hope he doesn't retire Bosch, either. I think Connelly should turn out two books a year -- one of each guy. I know it won't happen, but I can dream. Thanks again, Mr. Connelly, for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"How do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you've ever read? This was a well-paced, highly entertaining story, but the book's real success is its longevity. You continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it. Hands down, this is Connelly's best novel. Few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end. Mick Haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works. To him, it's a machine, and he's the \\"greasy angel\\" who keeps it well oiled. Even though Haller's cynicism is a constant source of amusement, his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence. Then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client, who can pay top dollar. Accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman, Louis Roulet hires his services. What first seems to be a straight forward case, will ultimately test Haller to his limits: his family will be threatened, he will be accused of a crime, and someone very close to him will die. Not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system, the writing is first-rate."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I think this is his best book yet. While it was a slow start, a plot twist grabbed my interest and I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Having read and enjoyed quite a few of Connelly's Harry Bosch mysteries, I was a little leery about reading this novel, which doesn't include detective Harry but introduces a new protagonist, Mickey Haller.Mickey is called a Lincoln lawyer because his \\"office\\" is a Lincoln Town Car. Initially it was difficult for me to identify with Mickey who's had two failed marriages and defends people he's quite sure are guilty of the crime they're charged with.As the book opens Mickey is the definition of sleazy. For him the bottom line is money; he cheerfully defends people he wouldn't want in his own home and usually gets them acquitted. For Mickey money is the bottom line. There's not enough money, however, because many of Mickey's clients are poor and what Mickey really hopes for are franchise clients. A franchise client is rich. He/she will pay Mickey at least $100,000 to defend him/her. If he is acquitted, and he usually is, he makes Mickey his go to attorney and the next time he is charged with a crime Mickey is in the money again. Mickey hasn't had a franchise client in several years and he's up to his eyeballs in debt. Along comes Louis Roulet, son of the classy Mary Windsor and future heir to a thriving real estate business in Beverly Hills. Louis, a bachelor in his thirties, is charged with attacking a call girl. Louis's family has its own lawyer, but he chooses Mickey to defend him because of Mickey's success rate at acquitting defendants of serious crimes.This case becomes a life changer for Mickey. Unfortunately it becomes entwined with an earlier case and a defendant whom Mickey unsuccessfully defended. Mickey begins to realize that he is unable to recognize innocence when he sees it and the two cases together call for some mighty fine choreography. Mickey's in a real pickle.How he handles these two cases while remaining loyal to both his current and former clients made Mickey Haller a human being whom I could begin to respect.Like Connelly's earlier books, this one is well written with finely drawn believable characters. Mickey's relationships with his two former wives are surprisingly good and he strives, if not always successfully, to be a good father to his young daughter from his first marriage. The book is quite engrossing although I wouldn't say it's a page turner like one of Lee Child's books.I'm wondering if Connelly's intent is to feature Mickey in future mysteries and I hope he does."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is my favorite contemporary author. His Harry Bosch novels are unparalleled in the area of crime fiction. I admire him for branching out with other protagonists, but the Lincoln Lawyer doesn't quite suffice when compared to his other work. The premise is interesting, the writing moves along and holds the reader's interest, but plausibility is what is lacking. There are just too many instances in this novel where I could not buy what the protagonist does, or doesn't do. I've never felt that way when reading about Bosch as the protagonist. I'm sure there will be more novels featuring the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\". Let's hope he someday rises to the level of Harry Bosch in terms of credibility."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly can write!!! This book is very well crafted and lightning paced. The story is believable and well thought out, and the characters are nearly perfect. The client is totally scary, and the plot twists keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat for all 500 pages. Beyond that, this book explores the methods and the ethics both of defense lawyers and of prosecutors' offices with neither coming out totally clean.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a page turner par excellence. The only writers I know of that can hold a candle to this are John Grisham and Nelson Demille, and Connelly just trumped them both with this one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The scariest client, LA defense attorney Mickey Haller says, is one who is innocent. Haller should know, being a journeyman trial attorney working the routine turf of the LA court system, Haller has never had to contend with the possibility that the client he may or may not get off, or at the very least, get plea-bargained down is actually innocent. Until now.Haller gets what he calls a \\"franchise case\\" a whopping big murder trial with a client with lots of money behind him. Most of Haller's clients are the flotsam and jetsom of the system: prostitutes, junkies, drug growers and dealers, and the like. These habitual losers flow through the system, what Haller calls \\"the machine\\" on a regular basis providing him with a steady income and cynical life. Twice divorced, Mickey accepts the truth in the joke of his being a \\"bottom feeder\\", but even the rationales he uses to justify his \\"playing his part\\" in fighting the \\"machine\\" are starting to wear thin.And then he gets his \\"franchise\\" murder trial and the truth of his deceased superstar defense attorney father's statement that the scariest client is an innocent one, because then the game really matters for both client and lawyer, and a loss can destroy both, comes home to roost.And the fun begins, with Michael Connelly spinning a snappy and fast and very entertaining read. A perfect summer book. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is an insightful, intense, exciting, convoluted tale of a defense attorney's realistic and yet cynical approach to practicing law. His well described methods produce a high rate of courtroom wins, but require the development of many scars and moral callouses. This author knows his subject and his craft, from years as a journalist focusing on crime. Here's hoping he'll fire up the Lincoln soon and get more books written about his hero!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly has diverted his energy from his long running Harry Bosch series (which I love) to create a new and exciting character....a criminal defense lawyer named Mickey Haller. Haller performs a majority of his business from the backseat of his Lincoln Towncar(s)......(he owns a total of five, all the same year, color, etc.) His clients are drug dealers, bikers, con artists and the usual assortment of unsavory characters. His latest client, Louis Roulet, is a lawyers dream. He is rich, well connected, and his case appears to be a slam dunk. As with most things in life, this case and the client are not what they appear to be. And there begins a rich and fascinating story that pulls you in from page one and takes you on a thrill ride full of intelligent plotting and clever twists before depositing you at page #404. The story will leave you breathless and looking forward to another ride with Mickey Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have been reading mystery novels for so many years and can almost always figure out the entire plot before finishing the first chapter. This book was different; there were lots of plot twists and the characters were well developed, complex, and likeable. I got my money's worth on this one!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm a lawyer and I even learned some terminology from this book. The insites are interesting and the concept of a lawyer running his entire practice from an automobile is an interesting one. There are legends in the bar of \\"motion warriers\\". Lawyers who go from courtroom to courtroom arguing motions in civil cases without an office or much of a file for that matter. This book reminded me of that legend."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer is the first book I've read from Michael Connelly. When I finished, I was left to wonder why I hadn't yet picked up any of his previous works. This book was fantastic - completely captivating and nearly impossible to put down. The lead character, Mickey Haller, is a criminal defense lawyer who is called upon to defend a wealthy Los Angeles realtor accused of attempted murder. Connelly pulls the story forward with strong character development, with the reader drawn into a range of emotions and motivations that spans the character set. Although there are those out there who often view defense lawyers as being barely above pond scum on the food chain, Connelly is able to give Haller a human face as he tackles the moral dilemmas inherent to his work. Start to finish, this is a great story. Now, I'm off to tackle some more from Connelly that I have been missing."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Over the years, Michael Connelly has established himself as one of the best crime writers of our generation, with his Harry Bosch series and his excellent stand alones. With THE LINCOLN LAWYER, Connelly breaches the legalese for the first time and the result is utterly brilliant.We are given an anti-hero in Michael Haller, a lawyer who works out of his Lincoln Towncar (thus the title) and who has made his career on getting lowlife lesser sentences or completely off the hook. He is even still friendly with his two ex-wives: prosecutor Maggie McPherson and his secretary Lorna Taylor. And it's to Connelly's credit that despite Haller's faults, he is a brilliant attorney and a marvelous character. His latest case looks like a real moneymaker for Haller: defending a rich real estate mogul named Louis Roulet, who is accused of raping and beating a hooker. It looks like an easy ride until startling developments point to a previous crime in which Haller's defendant was sentenced to life for a similar crime, resulting in murder.No more on the story, it's way too complex to divulge. Suffice to say, this is marvelous writing, with compelling subplots, suspense, terror and pure narrative dynamite. THE LINCOLN LAWYER is hopefully the first in a series of Haller novels---it certainly deserves to be."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"After fifteen Harry Bosch mysteries, Mr. Connelly must have gotten tired ot trying to find another interesting story to fit into the same framework. It must be difficult to write story after story without beginning to repeat yourself. So in this book he breaks out to do something different.His hero here is a criminal defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln. Mickey Haller is an attorney that hasn't come close to making it in the big leagues. He's not got a real life, big paying client. Then guess what - a murder and close to home. And maybe the murderer isn't finished.The book is well done, the hero is the modern type with a full set of problems of his own (two ex-wives, I just have one and that's bad enough) thrust into a confusing situation with ethical, leagal and a full set of other problems. The only problem is that it's just such a break from a visit from an old friend like Harry Bosch. Let's have another Harry Bosch, but then maybe another Mickey Haller. I began to kind of like him."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read them all and I don't know how, Connelly keeps getting better. Of course the how is he is a great writer with a realistic imagination. He is obviously a hard worker and has certainly learned to pace his writing.All that said, this is a bell ringer of a plot. I was hoping for another 300 pages, but that would not have worked with the laconic excellent writing style.I can't wait for the next."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I hope The Lincoln Lawyer is not the last we read of Mickey Haller. He's certainly not perfect, but he's an appealing character and the type of defense attorney you would want in your corner. I throughly enjoyed this book.I've read all of Mr. Connelly's books and look forward to each new one. I also hope we haven't seen the last of Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael (Micky to his friends) Haller is the son of a famous LA defense lawyer who died when he was five. Despite barely knowing his father Micky decides to join the bar at a somewhat less lofty level than his reknown father. Micky is a \\"Lincoln Lawyer.\\" A lawyer who conducts his business out of his Lincoln while travelling between appointments. Micky has two ex-wives and a 5 year old daughter all of whom love him despite his shortcomings.His first wife Maggie McPherson, or as he affectionately refers to her Maggie McFierce just happens to be one of the fiercest deputy district attorneys practicing in the Van Nuys courthouse. Maggie is also the mother of Micky's 5 year old daughter who he has been largely ignoring. But Micky, recognizing his deficiencies as a father is trying to make up for lost time and is successfully managing to get more involved in his daughter's life.Lorna Taylor is Haller's case manager. And also his second wife. Earl Briggs is Haller's driver and is working off the fee he owes Haller for getting him probation on a cocaine sales conviction. Raul Levin is Haller's private investigator, a former police officer. Levin share a close professional as well as friendly relationship.The book opens with Micky landing a \\"franchise\\" client. A \\"franchise\\" is a client who can afford to pay the schedule \\"A\\" rates (as opposed to the lower schedule \\"B\\" rates he is usually willing to accept) and whose case demands many billable hours. Louis Roulet, a wealthy real-estate investor is such a client. He has been accused of brutally beating a call girl and attempted murder. And for once, Micky feels he may have landed that most dangerous client of all, an innocent man. But Haller soon discovers that \\"things are seldom as they seem.\\" The further he delves into the Roulet case the more evident it becomes that he may well be dealing with an innocent client - jut not Roulet!Haller, like all good characters, is a complex mixture of good and not so good. But on balance, Haller is a good man seeking the sort of redemption that only the Truth can provide. He finds himself the subject of a murder investigation that he strongly suspects his client Roulet has committed. He believes that despite years of defense work he has come into contact, for the first time, with the devil.The book takes many interesting twists and turns and is, all in all an enjoyable read, introducing yet another conflicted character (like Harry Bosch) that readers will come to know and love."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I am not going to go into the plot of this book, the other reviewers and synopsis writers have done all that. I am just writing to tell the other readers this is a great book. Every time I pick up a new Michael Connelly book, I think he can't possibly top the last one. But he does....this is one great book. It was a little slow to start, but it gives the reader a chance to really get to know the main character, and then it just takes off, the book is so hard to put down. Read it, enjoy it, and hope we will see this new Connelly character again."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is the best author of detective novels and legal thrillers going in today's America. He must be since he has gone from writing the Harry Bosch novels to writing about a new well-drawn character, defense lawyer Mickey Haller.Haller is a different breed of cat than Bosch. Bosch is a heroic figure who is fairly ethical. Haller, on the other hand, is an anti-hero who is often less than ethical. Haller works out of his car and defends riff raff.In the Lincoln Lawyer, Haller suffers from an uncharacteristic twinge of conscience. Also, a crime hits close to home. These events test his mettle as a defense lawyer almost as much as his oftentimes surly clients do.One thing that is constantly on Haller's mind is this wise sentence uttered by his lawyer father:\\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you [mess] up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.\\"It is this sentence that drives Haller's pursuit of justice and subsequently Michael Connelly's superb new novel The Lincoln Lawyer. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As this likeable, rough, flawed and intelligent champ of the common criminal with his own messed up life becomes enmeshed in seeking the real truth about his client, he gets in a little over his head. It moves from legal thriller, to dangerous thriller. I loved the book, but not sure if the author will ever really let this hero's character truly grow and develop in the sequels, or if he will become stereotyped. Guess I'll have to read another one to find out."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a great book. Had some interesting twists and turns along the way, which keeps the reader interested. Very much enjoyed it and would recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a good one, a really good one. Great characters, nice suspense. I was fully engrossed from beginning to end and it had me prepped to read the sequel right away. I have read a few books by Connelly and Lincoln Lawyer is my favorite so far."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"After years of reading John Grisham books I never really gave other authors a chance in this genre. However, the other day I saw the preview for this movie and knew I would love the book!So, I picked up my first ever Michael Connelly novel or should I say downloaded it to my iPad ;) I loved this book and can't wait to read other books by Michael Connelly. If anyone has suggestions let me know.I was hooked from chapter 1 and the fact that they chose Matthew McConaughy as Haller, the criminal defense attorney, and Ryan Phillippe as Louis, the Beverly Hills playboy, made it that much easier to visualize the characters. My fellow female readers will enjoy that bit of info. :)Overall, this was a quick, easy, and enjoyable read! I can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I read it after seeing a preview for the upcoming movie and thought I'd read the book before seeing the movie. It was a very good read! I had never read any of this author's books and now I am a big fan. I read the brass verdict after reading this one and have to say, that one was even better than this one! Great pace, easy read, entertaining. Would highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book is and the movie are my favorites at the moment. I loved the movie and bought the book afterward. The movie was so good and so is the book, however they are so close, that you don't want to read the book just after seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael (Mickey) Haller is a street-smart lawyer who runs most of his business out of his Lincoln Town Car (hence the title), with a driver who uses an iPod and its earphones to not hear conversations he is not supposed to hear (privileged conversations and all that). Haller has been a lawyer long enough to know it is not so much about the guilt or innocence as much about representing the other side of justice. He does however worry about coming across an innocent client and not recognizing that. The prosecution sees him as lower than scum, and there is a running joke about fish and lawyers that is funny, especially as it travels from one person to the other in the book. Haller is a likable cynic, who is on good terms with his two ex-wives. Imagine. Only a lawyer could manage that you would think.The plot starts to form, and almost immediately thicken, when Haller is picked to defend Louis Roulet, a rich real estate agent accused of assault and worse. Haller is looking at this as a \\"franchise case\\" - \\"A franchise client is a defendant who wants to go to trial and has the money to pay his lawyer's schedule A rates. From first appearance to arraignment to preliminary hearing and on to trial and then appeal, the franchise client demands hundreds if not thousands of billable hours. ... From where I hunt, they are the rarest and most highly sought beast in the jungle.\\" The case seems to crack wide open early on, and then starts to cracks back shut, trapping Haller in a life-and-death pincer grip as it does so. After that, there are a series of turns that leave Haller desperately trying to save his own life, his family's, defend Roulet, who has a darker past than he led on initially, and save himself from being disbarred.There are several other threads that run through the book, all of which are handled very well by the author. The trial itself covers a lot of ink in the book and is basically forms the climax of the novel, and is paced excellently.Haller may or may not have a franchise case on his hands in the novel, but Connelly, the author, certainly penned a franchise novel. There have been three more Haller novels since, the latest one being The Fifth Witness.An outstanding thriller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Normally I enjoy a book much more than a movie.

However, the characters were never introduced well. More needed to laid down before the first section tore off in such a hurry. The tempo of the plot was off. The first section was too fast, causing confusion, and the third section seemed like an afterthought. One plot point, Haller's relationship with his daughter was mentioned, but never developed.How he ended up with two ex-wives was never developed. New characters need to be developed. Plot spacing is necessary if you want the audience to folow twists and turns."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book was just average at best. Nothing groundbreaking at all.

Michael Connelly is a master at spinning a fascinating story that pulls the reader to keep turning the pages with the different twists and turns. I've read several other Connelly novels and this one delivered like the others. It is well worth your investment--time and money from my view."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I honestly think this was a great book. I hardly ever give 5 star reviews and I don't generally trust them. I don't think this book is 5 star quality. If you don't like reading about the process a defense attorney goes through to win a case you probably won't like this book. I think you have to really take pleasure in watching the strategy that goes into not only winning the case but setting up the ending of this book unfold to enjoy it.Some reviews complain about cliche characters in this book but I guess that doesn't really bother me. Mickey Haller is an interesting character. He is not a crusader for justice. He is not some idealist, or someone who has totally lost faith in the system. He is someone who likes the game and likes the money. He likes to win, and believes that everyone is entitled to a defense. And he takes pleasure in winning, even if his client is a scumbag.It was excellent and it didn't really slow down. But again, you have to like reading about the process and procedure of being a defense attorney. It actually reads a lot like an episode of Law & Order but from the Defense Attorney's side."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I've been fan of Micheal Connelly for a long time now, and read pretty much everything he has written. So I was naturally skeptical about his new character Mickey Haller. Do not be. Mickey Haller is truly a great character. Very believable, real, complex and interesting. Very similar to Harry Bosh's character, but tempting the law even more. I think that Connelly is actually using real people he met for his characters, unlike some other writers who make up their characters out of thin air and therefore become one dimensional and flat.Lincoln Lawyer has a great plot, excellent pacing, superb build up of suspense and lots of unexpected twists and turns. Connelly as always has very tight but at the same time relaxed and simple style of writing that just pulls you in no matter what he is writing about. Definitely one of Connelly's best works.I am so glad that I read this book, especially after my last few flops. Very refreshing to read something meant for adults. Read this book, I grantee you will not be disappointed.The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars, is because I reserve 5 stars for literary masterpieces and life changing works. It is the highest score and in my opinion should be reserved for such works."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"First time reader of Michael Connelly. Loved the book. Completely interested the entire time I read it ...and I am now working on my 3rd novel with him."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"We all know this writer. So don't need to go on about him. Tell you why I got this. Back in England I love to keep my foot in the States by reading the New Yorker. There was an article about the IPad, and also Amazon's version of the same, and the writer was talking about what he loves to read on these screens (give me a real book any day... I love the feel of the paper!), and he mentioned this book as something he \\"breezed\\" through. I like books I can breeze through. And yes, you are immediately grabbed. It reminds me of those perpetually moving seats on a ride at Disneyland. You sort of go on a moving floor that takes you at the same speed as the moving seats, and them jump in and you're off, with nothing stopping you. That's how his books read. This one was really fun, since he talks a great deal about Hollywood and what is called in the States as \\"the Valley\\" (my daughter used to say she was a \\"Valley Girl!\\"). It has that, \\"oh no... what did I get myself into\\" kind of feel. Bad part, it's very predicable. You know who is going to get killed, who is going to get double-crossed, who the bad guys and gals are. Once he sets something up, you sort of wait for the \\"twist\\", and then... there it comes. Like ordering something strange at a sushi bar. It may surprise you when the wiggling tentacles of Tako comes to your table, but you don't scream or anything, since you were expecting it all along. But is that a bad thing? I mean, while you are waiting for the big finish, it's fun to read. You like the characters. Come on. Fast food can be great.

However, as the story goes on his character changes. The book will keep you interested and even has a surprising twist or two."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I usually read the book first then see the movie, not in this case. I was pleasantly surprised to see I still liked the book better, which is usually the case for me.

The story was loosely woven and sometimes all the pieces did not fit. The ending was a disappointment, did Connelley just get tired of the mess he created and opt for an easy out? Often a writer will do well in the first half of the story and then, things just begin to either fall apart or at best, not fit together well.

For a list of his book by series and published date, go to wikipedia."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's knowledge for the justice system is evident in The Lincoln Lawyer, as he draws the readers in with a few heightened moments of twists and turns in Haller's case. The author keep us out of the loop for the answer until the book's conclusion, which always makes for a good suspsense. In The Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller is a sort of slick, cool defense attorney who has a knack for defending some of the rougher people in society. Through his years of experience, he has formed a sort of cynical philosophy of the justice system as a machine in which he plays a part--he is just a cog in the machinery that keeps it running and flowing, a \\"greasy angel\\" of the law both wanted and hated. He reasons that it is like a business where people get paid for performing a duty. The court system is rarely about justice, guilt or innocence because it is about making the machine continually run, so thinks Haller. However, when a tragic event directly becomes personal to him, suddenly this philosophy blows up in his face, and the \\"franchise\\" case that he had taken takes on a new, chilly perspective. Although Haller has a distorted view on the justice system and defends some low, shady characters, he still manages to be a sympathetic protagonist, an anti hero who you want to root despite his faults. This is probably because he has the street smarts to try to outwit the real villains out there.What I loved about The Lincoln Lawyer is Connelly's ability to keep you guessing and leading into some nice cliffhangers at the end of chapters, where we learn something critical to the plot. This really makes his book a page turner. I admit that it was fairly easy reading, very simplistic prose that won't wow you or give you literary goose bumps. Still, as a thriller and mystery The Lincoln Lawyer succeeds in keeping you on your seat wanting to see how events will be resolved, as Haller attempts to seek justice while not raising suspicion.This was my first Connelly book, although I have bought many for my dad, who is a big fan of his books, and I was quite impressed and looking forward to more from this author. I also look forward to seeing the film, hoping it will live up to the book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I had my doubts that Connelly could capture the legal world as well as he does the police world. However, my doubts ended by page 5. This is a great read and Mickey Haller is as compelling as Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I don't usually read legal thrillers, but I'm really glad I decided to try this one. The tension just keeps building thanks to engaging characters, snappy dialog and a fast paced plot with lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is about Mickey Haller, a sleazy but likeable defense attorney whose ex-wives are his secretary and a prosecuting attorney. Mickey is used to defending creeps but when he defends a rich realtor scumbag named Louis Roulet on an aggravated assault charge, he discovers his life and the lives of those he loves are in danger. I am at a loss for words on this one because it portrays the justice system in a very bad light. Some things were very disturbing to me but it is a good read. It has suspense, some mystery and some surprises."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have three confessions to make, first, I am a huge Michael Connelly fan and have been reading his Harry Bosch books for fourteen years and the second, I am a sucker for books that have been made into movies and always want to read the book first and finally, I enjoy watching Matthew McConaughey, so imagining the main character, Mickey Haller, in the image of Matthew McConaughey added points to Michael Connelly's book The Lincoln Lawyer.Mickey Haller is a busy, ballsy defense lawyer who while he doesn't have many scruples, doesn't look down his nose at anyone. He sincerely tries to do his best job for his clients and is up front and honest with them about there chances and will so advise them. He sees is job as defense lawyers as knocking down the spinning plates of the prosecution's case until he has no case left.Haller is quirky and has a great and interesting support group. He pretty much works out of his Lincoln limo which is driven by an ex-client of his and he owns three more Lincoln's which he purchased on discount and plans to use when the first reaches 60,000 miles.His support group includes two ex-wives, one who is a top-notch prosecuting attorney and the other runs his office, a retired LAPD detective, who works for him investigating cases and a bail bondsman who refers clients to Haller.Although, Haller doesn't have a lot of scruples he does need money and works hard to get it. When he lucks into a franchise case representing a high powered real estate agent in an assault and attempted rape case, he thinks that his financial troubles may be over, but little does he know his troubles are just beginning.Now if that doesn't hook you into wanting to read The Lincoln Lawyer, I don't know what I can do to entice you."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Fantastic book. Great read. Couldn't put it down till it was finished.Great writing. The story flows smoothly as does the writing. The characters are believable and sympathetic. You feel like you know themI would highly recommend this story to anyone looking for a great read, that never gets stale.Good job!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I guess this is a new issue of the original book with a new cover to plug the movie. I see from IMDB that it will be staring Matthew McConaughey and Marisa Tomei, who are both excellent actors and beautiful people. The book itself is not quite as dark as much of Connelly's work, which is good, and has a bit more of a twist in the plot than his usual mysteries, with his primary character experiencing even more torment than usual for MC.The story does start off a bit slow, and you are nearly halfway through the book before Connelly starts to twist your intestines and get you thoroughly involved in the story. Stick with it - it's one of his best. And that says a lot."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"\\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you [screw] up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.\\" Mickey Haller's father, a renowned attorney gave him this one piece of advice. He always remembered it and, of course, this is the base of his trouble.Michael Connelly, the author of Harry Bosch novels has created a new character that is likeable, has many personal problems, likes to stick it to the authorities when needed, and understands that a defense attorney is the man who puts up with shit from his clients, from the oppositon and anyone else who feels the need. We know not far into this book that Mickey Haller will do what it takes to win the case. He insists that his clients be honest with him, and he will go to the end of the earth for them. Most of his clients are drug dealers, homeboys or prostitutes. He defends them, insists that they play straight and will help them out however he can. He is upfront that he needs to be paid, and most of these people find the money somewhere. He doesn't make enough money to really pay his bills, child support and the two mortgages on his home. But he survives. He has an interesting office, his Lincoln Town car. As he states \\"Have Case Will Travel,\\" and he moves from one southern California city to another in his car. One of his clients who had no way to pay his bills is working it off by acting as his driver. The client wears his I-Pod and listens to his homeboys, like Tupac, when Mickey has a case to discuss over the phone or needs to listen to tapes. This arrangement works out well for both of them.Mickey's current client is a very rich real estate agent, Louis Roulet, who is accused of attempted murder to a woman he picked up for sexual attention. The entire case leaves Mickey with a queasy feeling, and he enlists his private investigator friend, Raul Levin in learning all about this man. What he finds out is not pretty, but Mickey is smart and at the same time he is defending his client, he is working up a scheme to have his client booked for another murder. One of his former clients, who is serving life at San Quentin, is involved surreptiously, and this case becomes one of the most fascinating mysteries I have read.Mickey Haller is the kind of attorney we all want to be on our side. He is divorced from the woman he still loves, They share a child together, and even though they are separated they are together in many ways. Mickey hopes that he will soon grow up enough to appreciate what he gave away.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a very clever play on words. Even though I miss Harry Bosch, I believe that there are enough similarities that there may be a relationship here between Mickey and Harry that will grow. Michael Connelly always leaves a few clues in his books that we need to follow up. I am fascinated with Mickey Haller and want to follow him more closely. Looking for the next book, Michael Connelly. Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a streetwise defence attorney who takes care of societies underdogs: druggies, motorcycle gang members, the poor and disenfranchised. Haller's job is not about truth and justice, but about keeping the wheels of the system greased and turning, hopefully to his and his clients' advantage. Whether his client is guilty or innocent is irrelevant, it is about using and beating the system and winning regardless of the truth. The defence attorney's world is a world without truth. One of Haller's greatest fears, however, is not recognising the innocence of his client. In fact he states at the beginning of the novel: \\"There is no client as scary as an innocent man.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer is a great story. Haller must defend a client that appears as though is guilty of attempted rape and murder. All of the evidence points to his client's guilt, however, Louis Roulet, the accused, is a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate broker, and is known by the law community as a \\"franchise\\", a client that can be milked for the highest fees, the golden egg, thus Haller believes he has hit the client jack pot, but as the case unfolds, the evidence becomes complicated and steers in a direction which Haller would sooner do without.The best parts of this book are the court scenes as they come across as wholly credible, as if we the readers' are actually sitting at the back, taking notes. Haller is in a difficult position, and he is playing a dangerous game, playing both sides against the middle. It's a juggling act on a grand scale, and one ball dropped could bring the entire case crashing down around him.As a criminal defence mystery, The Lincoln Lawyer does not reveal its secrets until the last few chapters, forcing the reader to plough forward in one sitting. This is a great read because the writing is credible, confident and riveting. Haller is a smart and practical individual, who knows the system backwards and forwards, using it to his advantage. His final plan to bring out the truth is brilliant, but can fail at every turn if one ball is dropped -this is clever crime writing and well at the top of the Connelly list of great novels, including all the Harry Bosch stories.I hope Connelly decides to write another Mickey Haller story, as he is a terrific character. Definitely a five star crime novel."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Scott Turow's endorsement of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" fills the back cover of the book jacket, which is appropriate, as this is the finest legal drama since Turow redefined the genre with his 1987 blockbuster \\"Presumed Innocent\\". While this may be new territory for the popular Michael Connolly, he knocks it out of the park with this authoritative, well-researched thriller.Mickey Haller is \\"the Lincoln lawyer\\", a defense attorney who practices his trade from the back of a Lincoln in order to more efficiently cover Los Angeles' far flung legions of drug dealers, outlaw bikers, prostitutes and common criminals who've been drawn to Mick by way of his yellow pages and bus-bench-back ads. Years of dealing on the lower fringes of the LA culture have made Haller an expert, if jaded, practitioner of the local legal system, a master manipulator of the obscurities of law to the benefit of his typically less-than-desirable clientele. Haller, who is in no short supply of potential customers, is driven by only by greed: those able to pay, preferably up front, are welcome. Despite this, Haller is a likeable guy, and not without conscience. In fact, principle is at the core of Connolly's masterpiece: Haller has become so adept at pleading deals for his clients that he questions his ability to detect true innocence. When a Beverly Hills real estate executive retains Haller to represent him in an attempted rape/murder charge that looks like a set-up, he jumps at this potential \\"franchise\\" account - a meal ticket that promises to generate Mick's biggest payday ever.What starts with the easy and enjoyable banter of relationships and plea-bargains within LA's system accelerates unexpectedly to an unparalleled thriller of twists and true terror. Connolly creates a cast of believable characters: the cynical but admirable Haller, LA detectives hardened by years of defense lawyer hating, the detestable defendant, a host of others. Combined with lean dialogue and engaging back-stories, the original plot rings true as it careens through LA's valleys and hillsides in the backseat of Haller's Lincoln.In short, probably the best book I've read all year, and I've read a lot of them. Don't wait for the paperback - get it now."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is an amazing author - each of his books is a prize, and The Lincoln Lawyer is no exception - Since my brother is a lawyer (a corporate one), I thought about going into law also, but thought about the same things that plague Haller - clients who give the illusion of innocence and the absolute face of evil and the consequence of doing the right thing - is stunning -For those of you that enjoy a good lawyer book, this is for you - for the psychological fans, this is for you - for the folks who want a stunning read - well, you know - Worth the hardback price - am looking forward to the next Connelly book already."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I \\"discovered\\" Michael Connelly last year, when I started reading \\"The Poet\\". I must confess I tried to read Concrete Blond, and for some reason just couldn't get into it.Well, that was then, and this is now. By reading the Poet, I got excited about reading again, the way I used to when I first starting reading in my teens. I stayed up nights, because I couldn't go to sleep until I read another chapter.Well, after reading the Poet I read the Narrows the \\"sequel\\" to the Poet, and then read Concrete Blond. My Dad, who I turned onto Michael Connelly said, \\"Read his books in order\\", and he was so right. I wish I hadn't read Concrete Blond before I read Black Echo and Black Ice, but everything he writes as far as I'm concerned is GREAT.So when Lincoln Lawyer came out, and it was a \\"legal\\" thriller, which I do like by some authors, I thought I would not be able to like it as much as I have his other books. WRONG. Its a great book, another night of losing sleep, because of his little twists and turns that he always has in his magnificent books. It is just another GREAT Michael Connelly book and now I hope he brings Lawyer Mickey back, because I could love him like I do Bosch.This book starts out with you thinking one thing, and then changing your mind about 2 or three times about guilt or innocence of certain people, etc. It still have that bit of mystery and it doesn't really have too many more court scenes than some of his other \\"mystery\\" books, its just another book about a lawyer instead of a cop, but a lawyer that only is different and edgy because of Michael Connelly's great characters.Yes, there are different Michael Connelly books that I like a\\"tidge\\" better than others, but I have NEVER not loved every book I have read from this great author. The great thing about him is I have my Dad and Mom, Brother and Sister, and other members of our family trading books, and then when we have a family gathering and talk about the books we have read. We all have VERY different tastes in books, but Michael Connelly has the ability to be one of those rare \\"universal\\" authors, that everyone loves to read.He is my favorite author (along with about 2 others), and thank you God, he is prolific, and I hope he stays that way.If you have read ANY of MC's books and Liked them, then you will love Lincoln Lawyer, even though I thought, \\"Oh, this might be a book I won't like as MUCH\\". Wrong, I loved it, because I realized that once again he is creating a character that I care about, want to hear how he is doing, and I'm hoping he's going to have another book about Mickey in the very near future, and I love his Bosch character and loved McCaleb.He just never disappoints. His writing and his books have made me truly love reading the way I used to, but as I kept reading, I got pickier and pickier, and knew immediately when I liked a certain book, and didn't bother finish reading these books.I have written to Michael Connelly for giving me back a \\"fresh\\"look at the mystery genre, which has ALWAYS been my favorite, but I LOVE reading again, and STILL have a few more books to read of Michal Connelly and my only wish is that he keeps writing as many books as he has been. PLEASE Michael, I needyour books, and thanks for letting me remember why I lovedreading, it is a joy and not something to just get through, and I love that feeling of not be able to sleep, until you finish ONE more chapter!So, read Lincoln Lawyer, its itching for a sequel, and I hope there will be one in the near future!Take care and good reading!Jillartnjill@earthlink.net"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I don't think I can add much to the details in the other reviews without giving away too much of the plot, but...I was shocked and had to put down the book to do some research about two-thirds through. And that's when I discovered that Connelly had laced the book's characters with *real people*! At one point, the trial has LAPD sex crimes expert Dave Lambkin as a witness. But Detective Lambkin is a real person, who really is an expert on these crimes! (See the book \\"Homicide Central\\", by Miles Corwin, for details on his career.)Then there's a pair of defense lawyers, also real people, mentioned in the \\"postcard from Cuba\\" chapter. And lots of real LA landmarks, e.g. Phillippe's french dip sandwich restaurant.For a contrasting view, check out the book \\"Ready For The People\\" by Marissa Batt, an LA prosecutor.I read the book in a single sitting, but now I have to research the whole book again to see who else I missed! Thanks a lot, Connelly! Of course, that's after I pry it loose from my daughter's hands - the original Connelly fan in our family.The Los Angeles background is very well done, as is the rest of The Lincoln Lawyer. I can recommend this book without reservation, even if you have not read the Hieronymous Bosch series before. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly does well with everything he writes including this one. I could not put this book down. I would strongly recommend to anyone but especially to the Harry Bosch fans."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read a lot, upwards of 20 books a month. I read for pleasure, and most of the stuff I come across is not bad. Ocassionally, there is a gem. This is one of them. Great writing, great story. The twists and turns in the plot keep on coming and you simply cannot put this one down."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was another great book by a great author. Michael Connelly has always been one of my favorites, and this book was no exception. The story moved at a fast pace and the characters were all very likeable. I hope that Mr. Connelly will write more books about Mike and the people around him. I love Harry Bosch but I sense from the direction of the last few book in that series that Mr. Connelly is thinking about \\"retiring\\" Harry. If that is the case then I would like to see him replace Harry with Mike, maybe Harry could be Mike's new investigator. I definitely recommend this book. Happy Reading"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I really enjoyed this legal thriller that I found more enjoyable and a lot more believable than some of the top Grisham novels! Michael (Mickey) Haller is a lawyer who is used to wraggling with the legal system to catch breaks for obviously guilty people. He persues this line of work because his biggest fear is that one day he will be faced with having to defend a truly \\"innocent\\" person. The reason for the fear is that if he ever lost the case then he will have to live with the fact that he let an innocent man go to prison.Mickey comes into a case just like that and takes the case because it offers him possibly the biggest payday of his career. What he finds is that everything is not what it seems and he may have already have been guilty of letting an innocent man go to prison.With tension that you can cut a knife with up to the very last page, Connelly has done a masterful job. Even the ending is not what you expect and Connelly does not cop out as many other writers of successful thrillers have!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly takes a break from the Harry Bosch series and rolls out a new character named Mickey Haller, a scrappy, colorful, witty, and busy defense lawyer who mainly works out of the backseat of his Lincoln as he trolls the courts of Los Angeles County. Whether the client is guilty or innocent is beside the point. Haller is used to his clients being guilty in his own mind most of the time, but is not bothered by it, as he uses his skills to get them off and gain their likely repeat business. In fact, what scares him most is an innocent client because of the extreme pressure to bring in a favorable verdict and the crushing effect of a guilty verdict. Nevertheless, Haller more than ekes out a living and the reader goes along for the ride as he defends a number of mostly low life drug offenders and bikers. Like Connelly's Harry Bosch character, Haller is extremely competent, but near the fringes of his profession and respectability. In having a defense lawyer as the main character, Connelly has departed from his usual detective story and general admiration for the police. In fact he has chosen the sort of lawyer who Harry Bosch would likely despise, but respect and perhaps even come to like a little at the same time. The profile of a defense lawyer at work and juggling his personal life is very interesting and reminds me of a John Grisham novel in many ways. Haller is always on the lookout for a \\"franchise case\\" that will bring riches in client fees. This comes early in the book and Haller soon has to face to face the demons of his past and a \\"franchise\\" client whose case tests his savviness and abilities to the utmost and also presents the extreme moral dilemma and a heavy dose of danger at the same time. Haller has both righteous and shady sides and finds himself concerned that the case will end favorably too soon and thus cut short the hefty fees. Or can he do the right thing and still get the money? The Lincoln Lawyer is exciting, interesting, and crisply told and Mickey Haller is a character I look forward to meeting again. Those disappointed not to get their Harry Bosch fix will find Haller to be a welcome diversion."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I know. It's hard to believe...and Mickey Haller only represents guilty clients, too! In fact, part of his problem, which haunts him from time to time, is that he has lost the ability to distinguish innocence. He's not sure he recognizes it when he sees it anymore. This was a great tale, one of Connolly's best - and one that stays with you. I, too, was sure there would be something Abraham Lincolnesque involved - and found it very clever on Connolly's part to give Mickey a squad of Lincolns - each operating as his office, until it reached 50,000 miles! I'm becoming more and more a fan of books written in the first person. Connolly was especially adept at putting me inside Haller's brain - I felt his frustration and desperation - but I wasn't able to guess how he would solve his problems. And, that's what made it such a satisfying read. Dontcha just love a good book? All that time spent was so worthwile!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This highly entertaining thriller is a true page turner.

The symbolism is apt as Haller's legal world is not one of pursuing truth and justice as much as it is one of shading evidence and deal-making with prosecutors. His clientele has mostly consisted of lowlifes, who generally are more stupid, weak, and unlucky than evil. Now a slick real-estate agent, Louis Roulet, wants Haller to defend him against charges of assaulting a prostitute. Roulet represents the rarity of being a \\"franchise\\" client and has a look of innocence.One of Haller's concerns is that he will not recognize innocence when he sees it. In other words will he be too concerned with the deal to see a greater truth? Years before, Haller negotiated a deal of life with parole for Jesus Menendez for the rape and murder of a prostitute. Similarities in these two cases now force Haller to not only reexamine his assumptions of truth and innocence but also to confront the possibility of malevolence at work.Most of Connelly's work has followed LAPD detective Harry Bosch, a gritty and sympathetic character. Though the reader begins to know Haller, he is not yet in Bosch's category. Haller has some of the same relationship troubles as Bosch, yet in a less intense way. The plot was not quite as taut as found in most of the Bosch series, and not especially gripping. The courtroom saga was all preordained.This book represents a nice introduction to a new character and a shift in environment, though this is not Connelly's first foray into courtrooms. It will be interesting to see where Connelly goes with Haller and Bosch."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Just when some thought the estimable Michael Connelly had peaked with his popular Harry Bosch series and might just retire to a tropical isle (his own, of course), he introduces lawyer Mickey Haller in a SUSPENSE driven novel \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\"It must be a thrill for a voice performer to have first crack at interpreting a character's vocal patterns, especially a character that's sure to be as well received as Haller.

The Lincoln Lawyer, however, is his masterpiece to date. The novel begins slowly. It is not ponderous or dull; Connelly is simply setting the stage very carefully. Once set, the action is nonstop. The courtroom scenes are masterful, the characters engaging, the ending satisfying. As a sometime journalist Connelly does not utilize legal nuance the way, e.g., Steve Martini does. As a journalist, however, he has a greater sense of place and the feel of the streets and the sweat beneath a damp collar. The architectonics of the trial--the traps set and then sprung--are beautifully wrought and the overall plot arc most impressive. Don't miss this one and don't worry about setting aside the time to read it. Once you begin you won't stop and you'll end with a thirst for more. This could be the start of a new series."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I say that this effort of Michael Connelly's is a pleasant surprise because I have been so used to the Bosch series and I have been disappointed when other favorite authors drop a series character and try a stand alone (Robert Parker is also an exception). Not so with the Lincoln Lawyer, in fact I think Connelly has created another potential series character as good as Bosch but from another profession and a whole new list of character flaws and quirks. I hesitate to tell too much of the story - besides other reviewers have done it well enough and why repeat what you already know. suffice to say, that I wouldn't be at all surprised it this one wins Connelly an award or two, he deserves it. The plotting is up to his usual above average standards, the characters are interesting, if not always likable and the writing is as good as you are likely to read this season in a genre novel. Advice: Don't miss it, you'll kick yourself."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Departing from his bestselling, Edgar award-winning Harry Bosch series, Connelly jumps into the crowded and mostly lackluster field of legal thrillers with a tightly plotted page-turner.Reasonably successful, but always scrambling to meet his child-support and the hefty mortgage on his house, L.A. defense attorney Mickey Haller operates out of the back of his Lincoln Town Car, one of a fleet given in payment by a grateful client. Mickey defends mostly drug dealers and other low-lifes with enough cash to afford him. Although widely reviled by police, prosecutors, and other upstanding citizens, Haller makes no apologies for exploiting any loophole, crack or cranny in the prosecution's case to keep his paying criminals on the street.Following in the footsteps of his successful, long-dead, defense-attorney father, Haller believes wholeheartedly in the universal right to a vigorous defense. \\"But the law was different now. It was grayer. Ideals had long been downgraded to notions. Notions were optional.\\" Becoming more cynical, Haller is conscious of negotiating a thin line, and finds jail visits uncomfortable. \\"Sometimes I'm not sure which side of the bars I am on. To me it's always a dead-bang miracle that I get to walk out the way I walked in.\\"Louis Ross Roulet is different from Haller's usual run of client. For starters he's Beverly Hills rich, what's known in Haller's business as a \\"franchise,\\" a client with deep pockets who can afford a trial and exhaust every appeal known to law, keeping his lawyer in Town Cars. Also, he's never been arrested before. Worst of all, he may be innocent.Haller subscribes to his father's edict: \\"There is no client as scary as an innocent man,\\" because if you lose \\"and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.\\" There is no negotiation or plea bargain possible with an innocent client, only a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Haller already has one case that haunts him; he doesn't want another.Roulet has been charged with attempted murder and rape of a prostitute in her home. From the start he has insisted it was a set-up, a staged crime looking ahead to a pay-off in civil court.Naturally it quickly gets complicated and Connelly zigs and zags through the law and the devious quick-witted workings of Haller's mind, parrying thrust and counter thrust, while heightening a sense of menace. The courtroom drama is sharp and full of clever surprises and Mickey Haller is a likable if not sterling character.While not up to his Harry Bosch novels, and not at the level of Scott Turow (whose next book - not a courtroom thriller - comes out next month), this stands well above most of the genre."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the story of a lawyer who has allowed himself to lose sight of his priorities. It is a very redemptive story on many levels and was a wonderful read that encourages one to focus on what is truly important.The typical legal novel has about as much to do with the real practice of law as does the typical Hollywood offering with real life. Here's the dirty little secret: most lawyers find the majority of their job horribly tedious. Mind you, there is a real distinction between civil and criminal practice--I've done both (in LA) and find that Mr. Connelly has done a fine portrayal of the So. Cal defense bar. Frankly, criminal practice is just more interesting; it moves quicker and most often deals with issues of far more importance than how much money is owed by one to another, which is the staple question of the civil practice of law.The Lincoln Lawyer presents a plausible story though it probably assembles the best war stories of several experienced defense attorneys. Connelly's genius is his characterization--the twists are wicked and refreshingly unpredictable but the story is about real people facing real moral conflicts. I especially appreciated the implicit theme that too many of the participants in the justice system are forgetting or ignoring their duties to society in favor of personal advancement. Our protagonist, Mr. Haller, rediscovers why his job is important just as he comes to appreciate the value of his family and the many other things that are good about the life with which he has become increasingly frustrated.Connelly's take on the defense bar is typical. Contrary to our protagonist, defense attorneys are quite comfortable in their ability to recognize innocence and understand that their efforts in defending the guilty merely insure that the guilty are appropriately punished--absent a fair trial the guilty will be set free. Connelly shows that the most dangerous of prosecutors are those who believe that they are entitled to bend the rules in order to achieve the \\"right\\" result because it can actually backfire and cause the guilty to go free. You can never give the state a free ride; power must always be put to the test to insure that it is exercised properly. The Lincoln Lawyer demonstrates that this is an ideal that could be more fully appreciated.The police grab and prosecute the wrong person far more often than is publicly perceived. But, in fact, most police and DA's recognize and appreciate the function of a defense lawyer more so than does, for example, Detective Lankford. After reading this book, I would hope that it becomes clear that society has nothing to fear and everything to gain from the first-rate efforts of defense lawyers.As with other of Mr. Connelly's books, the writing is consistently excellent and you will not be able to put the book down until it is finished."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Haller's life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car. His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey. Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch. In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter. His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along. Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees. In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket.Louis Ross Roulet dealt in LA property he was a rich playboy, currently booked on charges of ag-assault, GBI, and attempted rape, and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court. Mickey couldn't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook. This was all too easy, in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case. Just as he was on a roll Mickey's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just didn't sit right, in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil.This is the first time in a long time that I have picked up a book based on a court room drama; but this book is much more than just that. Michael Connelly has done a wonderful job; his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through; well written and easy to follow so you don't get lost in the jargon of law, especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the US law system. I'm hoping very much that Mr. Connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer Mickey Haller in other books going forward, Congratulations to Michael Connelly for a rollercoaster read.A.Bowhill"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer is hilariously and profoundly true. If you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a high-powered criminal attorney, this book will show you. I am a civil attorney, myself, and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law. (Not that civil trial law is without its warts either.)Put simply, this novel is about \\"The Client From Hell.\\" Every lawyer has had one at one time or another, but not like this. Connelly's depiction of the protagonist's slow descent into you-know-where is engrossing, hilarious, and true-to-life. The only bad thing about this novel is that it might discourage some readers from a career in law. Or maybe it will encourage others. Hard to say. What I can say is that this is a well-written and engrossing novel that I could not put down until the final moment. That is high praise indeed.This is a remarkably well-written novel that keeps the reader guessing until the very last minute. You will come to know and care about the characters in this novel. Not only is the plot in this novel interesting and even engrossing, but (unlike a John Grisham novel) the characters are true-to-life as well. This novel rings with authenticity.This is my first Michael Connelly novel, but it will not be the last; not by any means. This one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a really, really good thriller. I think it's better than 'The Closers', too. It doesn't insult your intelligence and it's fairly informative about the legal trade as well. It's a quick read and is enjoyable; no matter what genre you prefer."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"My first Connelly book and it won't be my last. Even as a practicing lawyer, i found the book fascinating - the way he captured the true essence of all the players, the judge, the clients who NEVER tell you everything and the absurdity of THE SYSTEM that grinds all who enter!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Astonishing may be hyperbole to some, but I find it amazing that Connelly can change genres and have such command with his story. I do not have the novel in front of me as I write this review, but I must say that a lot of credit must be given to the 3 lawyers that Connelly acknowledges at the end of this wonderful novel. He captures inticacies of the legal profession like a seasoned trial attorney. He had to have some great input.Other reviewers have already praised the intricate and exciting plot. Mickey Haller plays more like an Elmore Leonard protaganist than a typical courtroom novelist hero. But I love the character and look forward to more enjoyable Haller novels. I think Connelly has the best overall work of any novelist working today. He is that good."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I agree with the other positive feedback from other reviewers so will not add. Someone else may have already pointed this out, I didn't read every single review, but some readers may not have realized that Mickey is Harry Bosch's half brother. And Mickey, like his famous lawyer father before him has a soft spot for prostitutes (as was Harry's mother). So even if this wasn't a Harry Bosch, Connelly kept it in the family."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The whole legal thriller genre (eg. John Grisham, Scott Turow, et al) has never really caught my interest, and I've never been a big fan of films or TV shows grounded in that world. But Connelly's last book (The Closers) was so good that I was willing to give his entry in the legal eagle stakes a chance, especially as the protagonist isn't some kind of crusader or underdog type, but more of a trashy bottom-feeder. Set in Los Angeles, the story follows multiple-divorcee, child-support paying criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, as he runs his practice out of the back of his ex-gang banger-chauffered Lincoln, rushing from courtroom to courtroom trying to meet his monthly expenses.Where the book excels is in showing how the wily defense lawyer works the system, drawing on seemingly bottomless bag of tricks to get his scummy clients (crystal- meth dealing bikers, internet scam artists, etc.), lighter sentences than they likely deserve. It's also excellent at showing the various relationships between defense lawyer, bailiffs, DAs, judges, bail bondsmen, investigators, and freelance journalists. Finally, it's also very good at showing just how all the pieces fit together, the half-page yellow pages ad that costs $5,000 a month, the bus bench ads, the varying fee schedules, how prospective clients get screened, the business cards with different degrees of access on them, the use of word of mouth in the jails to drive business, and on and on. All of the above is excellent stuff which really takes the reader deep into Haller's world.The main plotline concerns the arrival of a so-called \\"franchise\\" client -- that is, one with deep pockets and complicated case that can result in a huge huge payday for Haller, something in the six-figures realm. Louis Roulet is a high-end real estate broker accused of attempted rape and murder, and Haller is shocked and delighted when Roulet insists that Haller defend him. Without giving too much away, Haller and his investigator Raul put together a defense in much the same manner the cops might put together a case. Lots of good procedural details combined with good pacing keep the story going. However, something niggles at the back of Haller's mind, and as one might expect, he's in for a surprise or two. Meanwhile, another subplot shows him easing his way back into his ex-wife's good graces, and working to become a better father to their 7-year-old.The book's got a lot to like about it, but it's far from perfect. One annoying aspect is that Connelly is constantly over-explaining, reminding the reader who characters are, or what already well-established dynamics between characters are. It's very irritating and clumsy, and you'd think after ten books or so, he'd realize that his readers aren't idiots. Another flaw is the unsubtle nature of the theme. Connelly really pounds home the notion that Haller has lost his way (\\"I was always worried that I might not recognize innocence.\\"), haunted by the words of his famous dead father: \\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client.\\" All this agonizing about his profession and innocence gets exceedingly tiresome and simply gets in the way of a page-turner of a story. And like far too many crime writers, he tries mightily to be cool by having Haller down with gangster rap, knowledge about Tupac, Biggie, and so on -- all of which comes across as rather forced and cheesy.However, these are relatively minor sins, and the book is well worth reading for the intimate detail of criminal defense lawyers. It must also be said that the climactic courtroom scenes are virtuoso stuff, brilliant in pacing and tension. It'll be interesting to see if Connelly continues this as a series, and if he does, what other tricks of the trade are left to be shown."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michaek Connelly is known for his taught, suspenseful and intricate thrillers. For years, he has been pleasing fans of the detective genre with his Harry Bosch series. But this time around, Connelly tries his hand at writing a law thriller. That's right. His main character is a lawyer. There is a lot of courtroom action. And the result is as amazing as one could imagine, and much better than anything Grisham or Turow have written in years.Mickey Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, a name that refers to the car he loves to drive around. He is a criminal defense attorney who defends the worse of the worse. So when he meets Roulet, a young man accused of assault and attempt rape, it's just another day on the job for him. Only this time, the payout seems to be more lucrative than ever before. Before long, money signs are flashing before his eyes.But as Haller begins his own investigation, as he discovers secrets about his client, he realises that his worse fear has come true; that he is representing true evil, and that, in the past, innocence has slipt right through his fingers. And now, because of him, an innocent man is in prison.Haller soon finds himself in a very fine situation; Roulet is his client and there is very little he can do about the incriminating material he finds about him. And that is the masterstroke behind this novel; although you have an idea of what is going on, you never actually know where the book is heading. Connelly has many tricks up his sleeve and never ceases to impress the reader.The dialogue is brilliantly written. The suspense intense. The trial scenes realistic (it's amazing that Connelly doesn't have any background in procedural law, this novel seems like it was written by a pro). But what I liked most about this novel - and any Connelly novel for that matter - is the strong caracterisation. No one is perfect in this novel. No one is fully good either. Haller has his flaws, flaws that never truly leave him in the end. Sure, he says that he wants to quite being a lawyer as he gets in deeper and deeper, but we all know he is doing what he does best; lying. Haller loves the game way too much for that. We love to hate him and hate to love him.I also liked the fact that the other side of the table also has a lawyer you feel sorry for and yet hate. Haller is surrounded by great vivid characters that all have their play in this story.Although the sub-ending is a tad weak, I so enjoyed reading The Lincoln Lawyer that I can't wait to read it again. It is truly a wonderful page turner that proves, once and for all, that Connelly is today's master of suspense. Another winner from a great author."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Of the few audio novels I listen to a year, this one was pure pleasure. Not only was this a good legal thriller, but the reader was smooth. His voices for each character was recognizable and done with a skill few narrators have.A great story that was done well on audio.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"A really pleasurable book; a cut or two or three (or four) above the usual \\"Grisham\\" lawyer-focused mystery. Connelly is a very fine writer, both on the level of the sentence and of the plot. In this well-focused novel, he adapts the \\"noir\\" hero -- ironic, beaten down, but with finer aspirations -- to the popular conception of the sleazy criminal defense lawyer. His character, Mickey Haller, manages to finesse the distance between these two images, which interestingly links him to the Lincoln obliquely referenced by the title (literally, the title refers to the protagonist's office in a town car). The pragmatic populism of Abraham Lincoln helps to define this character and to give him some historical depth, though Haller, perched in an overpriced house on a hillside about to crash into the abyss, is cast onto the godforsaken landscape of So Cal and Hollywood. His reluctance to give up his estranged wife and their daughter gives the book an intriguing romantic interest and makes the hero even more appealing. I'd have given it five stars if I didn't have even higher hopes for the next book in what I hope is a new series for Connelly. I like Haller even better than Harry Bosch, the beguiling police office hero of earlier Connelly books."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I just finish reading The Lincoln Lawyer, and boy was it GOOD! The author introduces readers to Mickey Haller, a shady lawyer that does whatever he has to do personally and professionally to keep money in his bank accounts. He fights tooth and nail for his clients even when they're guilty.He doesn't have an office but instead conducts his legal affairs and business in the back of his lincoln. He has two ex wives, one who is just as shady as him and plays the part as his assistant.When Louis Roulet is referred to Mickey by his jail bondsman friend things take a turn for the best and the worst. Mickey is more than happy because with this client he has a chance to triple his bank accounts. Mickey and his client take readers on a rollercoaster ride as Mickey fights to prove his client's innocence. But will he lose the fight and sacirfice his freedom instead or will he get victory for his client and put himself in danger?This book was a pageturner for sure and the author did an excellent job keeping me on the egde of my seat. Michael Connelly is now one of my favorite authors. He tells a story so good with colorful details you'll never want it to end!*Definitely recommended to crime and legal thriller fans!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Been a long time fan of edge of the seat novels, but have never read him. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I instantly connected with the characters and the story. Looking forward to reading more of his novels."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have been a follower of Michael Connelly's work for a long time and have thoroughly enjoyed most of his detective thrillers. It had been a while since I last read Connelly so I picked up \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\" And wow, I thought this was his best work yet.Moving out of the precinct and into the courtroom, Connelly creates his new character, lawyer Mickey Haller. An attorney who routinely works the system to defend guilty clients, Haller believes he has hit the financial jackpot when he is hired to represent a wealthy client accused of attempted murder. Though Haller believes his client is guilty the case becomes more complicated when he becomes a suspect as well. No spoilers here. Just a promise of an elaborate plot that will fascinate you.The action is brisk with sudden unexpected turns. Throw in a bunch of intriguing characters with witty dialogue and you have book that steamrolls right over you. If you haven't read Michael Connelly, start with \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I just returned from my non-virtual book club discussion of The Lincoln Lawyer (by Michael Connelly).Among the six of us, the reaction was largely positive. 4.5 stars would work best.Some ranked the book quite high- a 98/100 was one score! Now this is the guy who has said that \\"only Sherlock Holmes merits a 100.\\"He and all of the members enjoyed the book's description of legal strategies and the courtroom repartee. Personally, I love books that provide an extensive dialog of lawyers examining witnesses. For me, it all began with the Perry Mason when I was in the 8th grade! At least 9 of the authors on my favorites list write books about lawyers. BTW, I prefer legal drama (Perry Mason) to legal thriller (The Firm), but I like them both. Id say that The Lincoln Lawyer falls about midway on the continuum between drama and thriller.None of us work in the \\"justice\\" system and can claim the ability to judge the realism in the book, but most of us had the feeling it was accurate. Unlike Perry Mason, Connelley's criminal defense attorney almost never has an innocent client. Indeed, that became the crux of the problem for the lead character who must face the mistake of contributing to the incarceration of an innocent man.Some interesting plot twists: the attorney's investigator gets killed. Gosh! The author killed his Paul Drake!In the final twist: we find out how the \\"bad guy\\" is able to move undetected across town to commit murder while wearing an anklet alarm system. OK, the author had me fooled, but my peers in the discussion group had figured it out in advance. You'll have to read it to find out yourself.Most of the difference of opinion about the book revolved around the central character. Some of us did not feel sufficient attraction to the character. It was suggested that defense attorneys created by J. F. Freedman were more likable/attractive. Other participants liked the development of the character through the book; as the book opens, the attorney is thoroughly jaded and seems resigned to perform a service, no matter how low he must stoop. By the end, he seems just a bit (thus, realistically) reformed by the crisis he underwent with the two principle clients featured in the plot. At the very least, the crisis brought out his more noble side.The group also exchanged views on the credibility of the client and his mother. This led to a reflection on the different mental states of murderers, including Jeffrey Dommer and Charles Stuart.I felt the book was a solid \\"B\\" and others in the group had no trouble giving the book a solid \\"A.\\" Our next book is listed on the TheMysteryBookClub blog."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I've enjoyed Michael Connelly since he wrote the early Harry Bosch stuff, Black Echo and Black Ice and so forth. I especially like some of the later Bosch books, and The Poet and Blood Work are among my favorite detective novels of the last 20 years or so. Sometimes I think his off-Bosch stuff only sort of works (Void Moon was only OK, Chasing the dime more mediocre) but generally I'm happy with one of his books. The Lincoln Lawyer falls into this category, not as bad as Chasing the Dime, probably about on the level of Void Moon and maybe a bit above it.So the main character here is a bit different, and so is the plot. In this case we have Mickey Haller, a somewhat sleazy lawyer (what they used to call an ambulance chaser). He bought four Lincoln town cars so he could get the fleet rate, and uses them until they have 60,000 miles on them, then sells them to a friend. He has a driver, a former client who's working off his fee by driving for Haller, and his \\"case manager\\" is an ex-wife. The other ex is a prosecutor.So we start the book and he's called to defend a Beverly Hills real estate salesman who's something of a playboy, and who's been accused of attempted rape. Haller is desperate for the case, thinking that it will be a \\"franchise\\", a case that goes on for a long time and will result in large fees for him. When things go wrong and someone close to Haller is killed in the course of the investigation, he has to figure a lawyer's way out of the predicament he's gotten himself into. The result is amusing, to say the least.As I said, I enjoy Michael Connelly a lot, and while this isn't a Bosch book, it's pretty good, and fun. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The main character: Inventive, cynical but decent.Plot: Nicely twisted.Ending: A bit melodramatic, but well prepared for.Style: Readable, funny, clever."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"My copy of this novel is festooned with accolades such as \`a crime writing genius', \`brilliantly plotted....expert, exciting and absorbing' and such like. Well, every single compliment is fully deserved because for me this has been one of the most entertaining stories of the past couple of years and it was just a shame that it had to end. One of those few occasions when you close the last page and wonder how on earth you can top that next time round. It really is a novel of the highest quality, an absolute must-read for lovers of courtroom drama as well as those who like crime fiction and legal thrillers in general. It has it all.No Harry Bosch though - this is a stand-alone told in the first person, the central character being Mickey Haller, a 40-something twice-divorced LA criminal defence lawyer who instead of having an office works, in effect, out of his chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car. The central storyline is his defence of wealthy estate agent Louis Ross Roulet who is charged with the assault and attempted rape of a woman in her own apartment. Of course, defence attorneys are often not the most popular of people, seeing that they sometimes prevent the guilty from serving any prison time, but in the case of Mickey Haller it's difficult not to root for him even if you grow to despise his clients. To quote from the novel, \\"You're a sleazy defence lawyer with two ex-wives and an eight-year-old daughter and we all still love you.\\" And this was said by a woman who stands on \`the other side of the aisle' as a prosecuting attorney.Indeed Haller still has deep feelings for Maggie, the first of his ex-wives and mother of the said daughter Hayley, and these emotions are played out with sensitivity and authenticity and with just the right exposure relative to the main plot-line. All in all a near flawless piece of story telling and it's got me adding the entire Connelly portfolio to my Wish List. Unhesitatingly and unconditionally recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I bought this book after the reviewer for another book I liked spoke well of it in passing. And I liked it. The book was very well plotted and the dialog and details seemed to be true to life (as far as I could tell anyway). It was easy reading.There were only a few problems. There were a couple very small bits of political correctness A silly judge into his irish heritage who makes something of it on St. Patrick's day is reflexively labeled a racist. And the main character believes he's gaining understanding of his black clients' lives by listening to rap music, which would be a bit like me thinking I understand Irish life because I listen to Van Morrison.But, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the lack of any greater philosophical or aphoristic content.

The fun of this book was trying to figure out how Micky was going to outwit a truly evil client while still doing his job as a defense lawyer. I won't tell you how he does it but of course you know that things will get fixed by the end of the story. I can't wait for the movie. I was pysched to see the movie but it was more important for me to see Michael Connelly's vision for this story because once a book ends up on the big screen you never know what to expect."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller, a cynical defense attorney who works out of a Lincoln Town Car (license plate: NT GLTY), is a seasoned expert at manipulating the justice system to free his guilty clients. He does this either by getting them off on a technicality or planting reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors. As his ad in the yellow pages says, \\"Reasonable doubt for a reasonable fee.\\"He makes for a compelling narrator in this story involving a client, Louis Roulet, accused of attempting to murder a woman he picks up in a bar. He's been a lawyer for fifteen years and he knows all the ins and outs of what he calls \\"the machine.\\" He describes the way each judge operates, the bail system, lock up, and finishes with a day by day account of the court case when Roulet goes to trial. The novel is packed with details about how the criminal justice system works, filtered through the experienced, jaded eyes of Haller.Haller works out of the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car so that he can make court dates all over Los Angeles. He's constantly on the move in order to earn money to pay off his mortgage on a house in the Hollywood Hills, where he seems not to spend almost any time at all. His chauffeur is a former client who owes him money and his administrative assistant is an ex-wife who works out of her apartment. He also works closely with an investigator and a bail bondsman. The setting is the familiar one of twentieth century American crime fiction, a Los Angeles of drug users, prostitutes and crazy rich families which we've seen before in works such as The Big Sleep and Chinatown.In the beginning of the story Haller has a very cynical view of the justice system, taking it for granted that all of his clients are guilty and it's up to him to negotiate on their behalf to get the best possible outcome in return for his fee. This could mean getting his clients their freedom on a technicality when the police have messed up or it could mean making a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty. Right and wrong, guilt and innocence don't enter into it; it's all about striking a deal for him.At first he sees Louis Roulet as a particularly lucrative client he refers to as a \\"franchise client,\\" someone who wants to go to trial and can afford to pay for the thousands of billable hours it will take Haller to prepare for and try the case. Indeed, Roulet lives in Holmby Hills, deals in real estate and drives a Porsche. He was arrested in the San Fernando Valley apartment of a woman he met in a bar and it appears as though she set him up in order to sue him for damages. The woman's background as a prostitute and Roulet's clean record makes Haller think that Roulet may be his first innocent client and in his philosophy of legal practice there is no client as scary as an innocent client because there's no negotiating possible, he has to get a not guilty verdict or he'll be scarred for life.The novel follows this case as Haller prepares for and goes to trial but it also shows how he reacts to his discovery that he really has had an innocent client. He develops into a person capable of seeing victims who need a system to help them and he comes to see his clients as people, not just opportunities to make money.This novel is an exciting thriller with unexpected twists, interesting characters and a complicated plot which unfolds against the backdrop of the great noir city of Los Angeles. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Loved it! I have not read anything by Michael Connelly before and this book did not dissapoint.

I can't even imagine what seeing it on the big screen will be like."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is always wonderful and the book's a must if you follow him. However, I have to say I was disappointed by the ending which was too much like that of an earlier book in the same series.

It had a good plot, interesting characters, and was well paced, but I felt a little let down that there wasn't a final confrontation between Haller and Roulet.Perhaps Hollywood has permanently damaged me when it comes to endings (in that the good guy and bad guy have to fight at the end), so when I neared the end of this book I was expecting at least be some type of final confrontation, but it just never happened."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Slow start with, in my opinion, too many facts thrown at you too soon.

Not the outcome itself, but the way that, after a few hundred pages of intertwined stories and plots, everything just sort of ended in the space of 20 pages.

Both are great!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw the coming attractions for the movie and since I usually prefer the book over a movie, I decided to give this one a read.

The result is fresh, surprising, and continually fascinating.Mickey Haller isn't your usual criminal lawyer: He's mostly concerned that he not be hired by an innocent client. Why? He's not sure he would know what to do.He lives the kind of high-profile life that prominent defense attorneys aspire to: public notoriety, a trophy home, great car (one of four Lincolns he bought to get a discount), and a chauffeur (a client who owes him money). Beneath the exterior, life isn't quite so good. He can barely afford the home; he's been divorced twice (but is still friendly with both ex-wives); and he has no personal life. Hope springs eternal. He feels like a good-paying defendant could solve all of his problems.As the book opens, that fond wish seems likely to be fulfilled when Harold Casey asks for Haller after being booked for aggravated assault, gross bodily injury, and attempted rape. Naturally, there are some problems, starting with Casey's snooty family lawyer, and whether the case will be pled or go to trial (there's not much money in getting a plea agreement).

Before long, Haller is looking into earlier crimes . . . and wondering some more.By the middle of the story, you'll wonder what Haller has gotten into . . . and how he can possibly deal with it.Before it's over, The Lincoln Lawyer combines a crime story, a courtroom drama, and a police procedural into one delicious tale.After you read this book, your only regret will be that Michael Connelly doesn't write more courtroom dramas featuring defense lawyers."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly takes into the life of a criminal defense lawyer in a way you've never experienced before.

This book's central character isn't as fascinating as Harry, but the book's a good read none-the-less. And the perspective of the central character -- a gritty, pragmatic and clever defense lawyer -- is unique. One that most people will have difficulty sympathizing with, but the author manages to carry it off anyway. Which always makes a book more interesting."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"My husband and I buy and read every Michael Connelly book featuring Harry Bosch, a world class fiction detective.This is a change of genre, to a court room thriller, and you will not want to stop reading it. Harry Bosch does not appear, as the author introduce a new main character.Mickey Haller, criminal defense attorney, has a harrowing tour in these pages. I enjoyed every minute of being along for the roller coaster ups and downs, as Mickey struggles to build his career, remain friends with his two ex-wives, become a better dad to his little girl, and mostly: to stay alive and out of prison, as he is set up to take a fall.Not only is this novel stellar, but I look forward to reading The Brass Verdict, where Mickey and Bosch will star, this October.This review written by the co-author ofA Scrapbook of Christmas Firsts: Stories to Warm Your Heart and Tips to Simplify Your Holidays"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's mystery/thrillers have always satisfied my appetite for urban crime stories. His Harry Bosch novels focus on a lost soul trying to make sense of the chaos in Los Angeles, and stop killers along the way. The Lincoln Lawyer came as a surprise - because there is humor and a fine eye for the absurd in Mickey Haller, the trial lawyer protagonist referenced by the book's title. The novel is a page turner with rich characters and twisted motives that will haunt you long after you finish the last page."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As usual Mr Connelly managed to entertain me with every page. This is one of his best. Love the new character Haller and looking forward to seeing him in future novels."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"It's kind of funny. My wife and I will ask how each other's book is and we will turn to the cover and quote one of the reviews, you know the ones, \\"A real page-turner!\\" \\"Riveting!\\" \\"A Gripping Yarn!\\" On the spine of my paperback of The Lincoln Lawyer, the one word quote from the Chicago Tribune is \\"Smashing\\" This sums it up nicely. Connelly is not my favorite author, but with this book he moves up my personal list of favorites. Both in his Bosch series and in this book, he takes you deeper into his characters than many writers will. I find myself wanting to know what makes these people tick and Connelly reveals it to the reader just a little at a time drawing you further and further into the lives of these people. The Lincoln Lawyer brings you into the life of a defense attorney and weaves several cases into one fantastic story.I am not one to throw around the five star review lightly, but this book deserves it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"With this book, Connelly delivers another page turner even though, unlike his Bosch novels, there is more suspense than mystery here. Connelly's strength is in developing readable plots with enough twists to make them interesting, and then moving them along with dispatch. In this respect, Lincoln Lawyer doesn't disappoint. I must also applaud the fact that he writes with what I call \\"efficient economy\\". In this type of book the development of too many characters could get in the way, so he focuses on the protagonist and leaves the other players in a workable two-dimensionality. Also, he strays from contrived and prolonged climactic scenes, or gimmicky last minute confessions and keeps most of the action at the cerebral level, much more appropriate for this type of story. The one flaw that cost him the fifth star is that, like too many other modern authors, he can't resist from injecting some disguised social commentary and pay homage to the gods of political correctness. This by itself would not necessarily be a significant flaw if it didn't result in the inevitable generalizations according to which all illegal immigrants are victimized, the underprivileged have no way out from a life of crime, while most rich white people are corrupt or evil. Still, compared to Pelecanos, whose stories are more excuses for social commentary than mystery or suspense novels, Connelly focus never strays too far from what it takes to move the plot along. As changes of pace go, this one beats \\"Chasing the Dime\\" by a long shot."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly writes spell binding character driven novels, and he's done it again in his legal murder mystery, The Lincoln Lawyer. Criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller's father. a legendary lawyer, died when Mickey was five. Haller never knew his dad whose clients included gangster Mickey Cohen. In fact, Mickey has inherited a gun that belonged to the gangster which plays a key role in the plot twists. One other thing the senior Haller bequeathed to his son is the notion that the scariest client a lawyer will ever have to defend is an innocent client because if you screw up, an innocent person goes to prison and it'll scar your life.Over the years Mickey has become jaded as a defense attorney and is afraid he will no longer be able to tell an innocent client when he sees one. This fear is heightened when a wealthy Los Angeles realtor Louis Roulet (Mickey's franchise client because he can pay whatever the fee is) who is accused of sexual assault and attempted murder asks Mickey to represent him. This is a step up for Mickey who's usual client list includes drug dealers, homeboys, and motorcycle thugs. But as Mickey begins to find holes in Roulet's story and also begins to believe Roulet is guilty and a psychopath, Haller remember's a former client, Jesus Menendez, convicted of a similar crime who's now languishing in San Quentin. Mickey comes to believe he wasn't able to tell when he had an innocent client, and that client isn't Roulet, but Jesus Menendez.I recommend this book. The characters are well drawn, the plots twists happen at a dizzying rate, and the moral question is compelling."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I had put off reading this offering. So many times when an author varies from his/her normal fare, it is not nearly as good. This time, it is at least at good, if not better... I am sorry I waited so long..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As an avid fan of theHarry Bosch series, I began this book with a bit of trepidation. At best, I was being forced to wait another year for a Bosch novel; at worst, Connelly's just decided to change genres for good. I quickly found out that Bosch is just taking a rest, and I couldn't be happier for giving this book a shot.The plot and pace will be fortunately familiar for Connelly's loyal fans. It manages to be quick and twisting but somehow gives you a day-to-day look at the character's life. What impressed me the most about this novel was the way the reader is introduced to the workings of the legal system. It is presented in a way that is both explanatory And feels natural in the way of dialogue and action. You don't necessarily feel that the author is going out of his way to bring you up to speed; you just feel in the know because of the writing. Very well done! I love my Harry Bosch, but I wouldn't mind a little more Mickey Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly took a break from his popular Harry Bosch series to write about lawyer Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller who does most of his work from the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car. He ususally represents lowlifes that can barely pay, but hits the jackpot when he gets a well-heeled franchise client (read: a big case with a paying client) in the person of Louis Roulet. Louis is accused of beating up a prostitute. It's not long before Haller decides that the cash that he got from the Roulet case was far from worth it.Michael has written a book I haven't enjoyed. I loved this new character even though I wonder why he doesn't have a thriving law practice in with a real office since he seems like one hellava lawyter. The plotline was paced well and very suspenseful. This was one hard book to put down. The most exciting thing is that Connelly is obviously preparing to write about Harry Bosch and Michael Haller in the same novel since they share a father. I can't wait. (12/22)"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When I first picked this book up I thought it was another Grisham novel because the title had the name \\"lawyer\\" in it. Only when I started to read it did I realize it was a Connelly novel, only not about Bosch the retired detective, but about a new character who is a criminal defense lawyer. To my great surprise and reading enjoyment, Connelly has not let us down, despite the great number of best sellers he has written. Unfortunately, this has happened to too many formerly great writers as they sacrifice good writing for the scared dollar.Let me tell you that Connelly has written a masterpiece legal/crime novel in a way that Grisham could not come close to writing. I literally could not put the book down, it was filled with several twists to make it unpredictable and interesting yet very believable to read. I could very well imagine substituting Bosch as the character for the defense attorney instead of Mickey Haller.I have been a big time Connelly fan for years and cannot wait for his next book. Maybe he feel Bosch has been a bit overworked and we will see more of Mickey Haller. I hope so!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read somewhere that Mr. Connelly was concerned that leaving Harry Bosch even briefly would leave a bad taste in the mouths of his army of followers. He shouldn't have given it a second thought.The salad days of \\"The Concrete Blond\\" and \\"The Black Ice\\" are back. New character; new ideas; new profession (kind of); same Mike Connelly.Hard to not talk about Bosch. Like Harry, Mickey Haller believes in his role. Like Harry, Mickey Haller will do anything to give his client a fighting chance. There's a line from the movie \\"The Untouchables\\" (Costner) when Sean Connery asks Costner regarding pursuing criminals in prohibition Chicago, 'how far are you willing to go?' Both Harry and Mickey would nod their heads affirmatively and say, 'as far as it takes.'Here Mickey spends a lot of time travelling between courts. Like the old Paladin business card (Have Gun Will Travel) Mickey's reads 'Have Case Will Travel.' Mickey knows and reminds us that as a matter of philosophic irony, in the stage play of Justice and the ensuing trial, truth or innocence plays second fiddle to the evidence. In every circumstance, can he beat the evidence?He runs into Louis Roulet, a wealthy client every lawyer dreams of because Roulet will pay Mickey anything. Mickey believes his ship has come in. Then as his own investigator Raul Levin generates more and more information, Haller isn't so certain and he's beginning to question his own creed.Great writing as we always get with Mike Connelly. 5 stars. Like Lehane who broke away from the Angie and Patrick series and Robert Crais with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, Connelly shows he's not afraid to bet on a dark horse. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is what's known in legal circles in the US as a \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" i.e. he works from the back of a huge Lincoln town car where he keeps his records and a lap top. These lawyers who don't operate from commercial premises are felt to be at the bottom of the legal food chain, with most of them barely scraping a living, so when Mickey receives a call to represent a Beverly Hills rich boy in a case, he's sure that his luck has changed. The rich young man, Louis Ross Roulet is the pampered son of an extremely wealthy realtor, a mother who has given her son everything that money can buy, but not much of herself. Roulet is accused of savagely beating a known prostitute, a claim that he vehemently denies, leaving Mickey to wonder if this is his first genuinely innocent client. As the investigation progresses, other incidents of violence emerge around this young man, muddying the waters in what Mickey had hoped was an open and shut case and a source of large money. I loved this book as the hero has a bit of the larrikin about him which reminded me of the Mickey Spillane type adventures. Michael Connelly is a splendid writer and one whose writing is very easy to read(which is not always the case)."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Being a true Connelly fan,enjoying most,if not all his works,I found this book to be his best in quite a while(although \\"The Narrows\\" was good, this is better).

As in \\"Chasing The Dime\\", he gives the reader another first person perspective from a new player:,seedy defense lawyer Micky Haller(hopefully a return character).The turf, although,is his usual LA back door nitty,gritty stuff; treading recent unbelievable \\"not guiltys\\" with a lawyer\\"s perspective (Grisham fans should like it,I did).

A good book is always better than the movie and this was no exception."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION:I enjoyed this. I was engaged throughout which surprised me. Normally I find most mysteries formulaic (slowly uncovering clues). This story felt different. I liked the process along the way. Mickey was a clever con man at times. For example, his client was worried about the press. So Mickey called over the man videotaping the courtroom process and asked what he would sell his tape for. Mickey then bought the tape for $1000, which impressed the client. The client didn't know that Mickey had a relationship with the video guy, using a code word between them to set the price. I loved the way Mickey's investigator checked out details for Mickey, and then someone was dumbfounded about how Mickey knew what he knew.During the middle I felt some frustration about a good guy being framed plus threats to kill his daughter. It's not a good plot device for me when there is too much of a \\"helpless\\" feeling. So there was some negative due to the helplessness. Of course by the end he pulled out of it which made it better for me.CAUTION SEMI-SPOILER:I had one other problem which was minor, but it still bothered me. A wanted B to testify in court with a lie. A asked C to convince B to do it. We never learn what was said to B or how B was convinced to do it. I also wondered about a potential blackmail threat that C could hold over A's head in the future - because of this false testimony.STORY BRIEF:It's told in first person by criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller. Louis is charged with beating a woman. Louis hires Mickey to defend him which is the main plot for this story. Some side stories include a prostitute who Mickey represents for free each time she's in trouble, and Jesus who Mickey defended two years earlier. Mickey has a great private investigator working for him. Mickey has interesting relationships with his two ex-wives: Maggie a prosecutor and Lorna his secretary.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 11 hrs and 39 mins. Narrator: Adam Grupper.

Gave it three stars because at least it got most of the legal process correct."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is not his best work. The story starts off slowly, becomes interesting about 50 pages in, and then offers up the bad guy threatening the good guy's family stuff that has been overused to the point it's a turnoff. I read no further. The thing of interest in this offering, the part I read, is how a defense attorney opperates, at least the one Connelly created. His lawyer is most interesting, but this time the story Connelly has to tell is a little too familiar as if he's been watching too much television, or reading other bestsellers."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The title annoyed me. Couldn't he have come up with a better title?But overall, it was a really good thriller.

What a disappointment! It wanders around for the first 90% of the book, the plot obvious and the characters wooden, then picks up in the court sessions but can't sustain it to the end, which is melodramatic in the extreme. There are 2 or 3 pages of insight into lawyers' psyches, but the rest is, uncharacteristically, made up of ponderous dialogue and irrelevant and boring subplots."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The only thing that kept me from giving this book 5 stars was Cliford Irving.

Why?I am a crime fan but I don't enjoy legal books at all and this book was the perfect example.The story introduces a new character (sadly, I can see the character being a permanent series character) called Mickey Haller who drives a Lincoln and practices defence law. He is not particularly pleasant and may be borderline dishonest. He is out for number one right through the book.He is given the chance to defend a seemingly innocent man who (as luck would have it) is loaded. Haller sees the chance to make a mint off the trial and further his career at the same time.The book moves along and we get to see that the innocent man may have a dark side to him.Ok, this is not too bad, but the thing that gets me is that the lead character has an answer for everything and seems to conduct a trial as if it is a game and what he is doing is putting the pieces into place at the right time for him. Everything in the book seemed to me to be too pat and that the author (one of the very best of the best) was trying to be too clever.Bring back Harry Bosch!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"not sure why or what I expected, but wasn't up to my expectations"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Everything is there: the plot, the characters, the legal fireworks, the unexpected twists and (as it is usually the case with Michael Connelly work) a chance to figure most of it out.Also this book leaves a funny feeling about criminal justice lawyers and generally people living in LA.Why would anybody in his/her right mind would like to be a criminal defense lawyer: you have to slave through a law school, you have to work your legs off, the work environment sucks, and at the end even a modestly successful lawyer could barely afford a house?Why would anybody in his/her right mind would like to be a prosecutor? It is even worse than being a defense lawyer: the environment is the same, the money are even worse, in addition there is an office politics and on top of it all it is a dead end job, with no prospects of doing better over time.Why would anybody in his/her right mind would like to live in LA where even lawyers cannot afford decent housing, where a rich man has to compete with a day laborer for the attention of a prostitute, with drugs, crime and smog are covering everything in sight?"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Micheal Connelly used to be a great writer......just the way Stephen Hunter was and Janet Evanavich and others used to be until the flame just ran out. Hate to say it but the man has no other stories left in him I believe.Of course he will continue to write more stories and they will become more sanctamonious as they go on and the characters will put everyone to sleep even faster.

It was the first time I've read Michael Connelly and it will certainly be the last. In comparisoon with other authors like Vince Flynn, Lee Child or Brian Haig, Connelly's story and character development are without punch or interest.

Mickey Haller is a bottom feeding attorney that luckily gets a big case or was he set up?

Disconcerting....but keep reading because this is an excellent book!The characters and the story draw you in for an incredible ride!Haller gets a chance at big fees when he gets a very wealthy young client to defend against charges of attempted rape and murder. Almost home free with his defense, the case suddenly spins out of control....and what a story."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"First published in late 2005, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" in Michael Connelly's 16th novel. Although, like the majority of Connelly's other books, it is set in LA it is only his fifth not to feature Harry Bosch. Instead, it introduces Mickey Haller, a Lincoln-driving defense attorney.Haller has two ex-wives, both of whom appear in the book. The first, Maggie McPherson, is the mother of Mickey's daughter and a prosecution lawyer. Not only did this keep their marriage lively, but it also contributed to her nickname - Maggie McFierce. His second, Lorna Taylor, plays a smaller role - she continues to work as his case manager and bookkeeper. Haller doesn't have any false illusions about the legal system or his role in it - in the early part of the book, there was very little I found admirable about him. He acknowledges the law isn't about truth, but rather about negotiation and manipulation. He realizes how unpopular the legal profession is, but chooses to see himself as a 'greasy angel'. More hinestly, he generally doesn't care about who committed the crime - so long as he can either get his client off or cut, what he feels, is the best deal possible. The events of this book do have an impact on his thinking though...Louis Ross Roulet appears to be exactly what Haller has been dreaming about - his first franchise client in a very long time. (A franchise client is one who wants to go to trial and can afford to pay the lawyer's top-of-the-line fees). Tipped off about Roulet by Fernando Valenzuela, a bail bondsman on Van Nuys Boulevard, Haller's new client has been charged with assaulting Regina Campo at her apartment. It's a charge he vigorously denies : he makes no secret of meeting her at a bar and arranging to meet her later at her apartment. However, he claims to have been stitched up, the victim of someone hoping to make a small fortune from a subsequent civil case. The more and more Haller and his investigator Raul Levin look into the case, however, the more and more dangerous it appears. It also makes Haller increasingly uncomfortable on a personal level. Two years previously, he'd represented Jesus Menendez on a similar charge - in that case, though, the victim had also been murdered. Menendez had always insisted he was innocent, but Haller barely even cared. Haller cut his client the best deal he thought possible - no death penalty and the chance of parole - but that involved Menendez taking a guilty plea. The Roulet case has now raised some doubts and woken Haller's long slumbering conscience.This is a very enjoyable book, and - after Harry Bosch - features Connelly's strongest 'hero'. There's also a nice twist that'll please Connelly's fans. Haller was only five years old when his father died, and although he doesn't know much about the man, there appear to be some similarities between them. Mickey's father, J. Michael Haller, was a very famous defense attorney. The bar also requires all lawyers to carry out some pro-bono work. One of our hero's pro-bono clients is Gloria Dayton, a high-priced prostitute. Mickey also discovered, browsing through the account books of his father's old law practice, that Mickey Senior also had something of a \\"soft spot\\" for LA's prostitutes - he, too, had defended many and charged few. This \\"soft spot\\" also means that Mickey Junior has a half-brother he doesn't know about. (His mysterious half-brother, by the way, is called Harry Bosch). Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"A great book! I will read others by this author."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I would probably give this a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. It's an interesting story, but not that well written. I just don't think Connelly is technically a good writer. I think he might be a better writer for screenplays. One of his sentences, for instance, went something like. \\"I talked until I was through talking.\\" He also gives details that are just have nothing to do with the plot."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Though the movie is very close to the novel, I have few issues with the movie. The movie failed to show the dissimilarity between the two assault victims, one was hit on the right side and the other on the left side; signifying the key aspect of Roulet's modus operandi."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"i like this, but not the best book ever. Nice characters.If you like this, you'll like this one.Caribbean Moon (A Manny Williams Thriller)"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book is the best. I mean it. Of all the books in the entire universe, this book is the best. Hmmm. That might be a slight exageration. Is that how you spell it? Is there a spell check on this thing? Anyway, its better than average I will say. Stick to the non-Bosch books and only joy will come to you."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was engaging reading, I am not going to deny that. I am just tired of lawyer novels. If you aren't then you will probably like this. Reminded me a bit like a light beer version of John Grisham. A good light beer, but still not as complex a storyline as Grisham. A tighter writer than Tanenbaum, though."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Like the movie this was a terrible read from the start to finish!

I have yet to read a Michael Connelly novel that I did not like.

I am a 3L and can appreciate the courtroom scenes as well as the excellent storyline.Is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Holds interest with character and twist. Above all, a well developed story. Good starting novel for the new year."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I am normally not a fan of legalese but this thriller was a pleasant surprise. A lawyer takes on the case of a rich youngster who is accused of beating up a sex worker. He discovers that the case is more complicated than it seemed at first. At the same time his fear of becoming too cynical and mistaking an innocent client for a guilty one is severely tested. That's really the theme of the book. This is also a well-balanced book that is neither pro nor anti-lawyer. There is lots of action and interesting technical information about the legal profession. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm a sucker for characters who don't see the world in black and white. I'm also drawn to characters who get in way over their heads and struggle to keep it intact. So when I read the back blurb of the Lincoln Lawyer, I was intrigued by the title character's flexible morals and supposedly money chasing attitude towards his craft. This is where my problem starts. When I started reading, I learned he is the legal profession's equivalent of Don LaFontaine, a well-known voice over actor who's frequently heard in movie trailers - he is so much in demand he actually has a limo going around the city to shuttle him between projects. He is not the struggling lawyer I was led to believe.So I got over it and tried to enjoy the rest of the book. Almost. The story itself lacks the suspense and the page-turning associated with previous Connelly novels, Bosch or non-Bosch. It is a pretty standard legal thriller, most disappointing is the villain. Supposedly devious and fear-inducing, Connelly tries to imbibe a Lecterian-like reputation, he comes off as boring and disappointing instead.Still, I feel the characters and settings of the Lincoln Lawyer is a good foundation for an enjoyable series, if not a television series. Hopefully, Mickey Haller's subsequent cases would prove to be more interesting and more intellectually complex as Connelly's other franchise characters."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book is simply Awesome, There are no other words to describe it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was my first Connelly book (I went out and bought a few more today, so that says something about the quality of writing).In the lawyer/court type genre this was a very good read, far better than anything Grisham has put out in years. As for being up to the same level of Turow, well that's pushing it a bit, Turow just has character building and solid plots down pat.This book was a bit predictable (not totally though, a few suprises) and some what melodramatic, however I'm being extra critical here as I did give it five stars and couldn't hardly put it down while I was reading it.Anyway if you like this type book, you'll want to read this one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The best book that I have ever read, no wonder it is on the New York Times Best Seller List! I loved this book and could not put this book down! Deffinitly a must read!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is an excellent story, expertly crafted, clearly written, with its many threads woven together neatly by the end. I thoroughly enjoyed the read and, while I wanted to know what was going to happen, I found myself putting the book aside because I didn't want to blow through it too fast. There's much to savor in The Lincoln Lawyer. There are no dull passages.The evil in the character of Louis Ross Roulet is chilling. His cold, calculated scheming is frightening to behold. As is often the case with evil, one wonders how good will ever be able to overcome it. Mickey Haller, a criminal defense lawyer, is called upon to defend Mr. Roulet in an attempted rape and murder case. Roulet insists on his innocence, but it soon becomes apparent to Haller that this may not be the case. As the story develops, we read about Haller's fears that in the smarmy world in which he works he may not recognize innocence if it ever presents itself to him. We learn that clients of lawyers like Haller are almost always guilty and it's the job of their lawyer(s) to get them off (which is why such lawyers are not very sympathetic characters).Haller struggles with increasing disenchantment with what he does for a living, his continuing love for his first wife, attorney Maggie McPherson (McFierce, as she's known to some), his love and concern over the well-being of both Mags and their daughter, Hayley, as the plot thickens. Then the real horror hits. He discovers he has faced innocence and, not only did he not recognize it, he was responsible for the destruction of a man's life. Can he change things? Can he prove what he needs to so an innocent man can go free and the guilty party be put away forever? Will he, himself, end up in prison for murder?You'll be holding your breath a lot in this one!Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'll admit upfront - I'm one of the few readers who doesn't care for Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series. Connelly simply takes too long to tell a story, for my taste. But after reading the great reviews for this book, I picked up the audio version at the library, and was initially hooked. The reader does a fine job with the voices, the pacing is good, and the main character, defense lawyer Mickey Haller, is a complex individual with many layers. Mickey may be willing to help the guilty go free, but it's not out of cynicism that he does so - someone has to defend them; someone has to oppose the power and resources of the state. Mickey may hang with scumbags most of the time, but he has a decent and sympathetic side as well - he loves his little daughter, he's on good terms with his two ex-wives, he has a soft spot for the occasional lost soul, such as the prostitute he regularly defends for free.When Mickey lands the job of defending a wealthy mama's boy (Louis Roulet) against an apparently bogus assault charge, he thinks he's hit the jackpot - an innocent client who's wealthy enough to pay whatever it takes. Mickey sees himself making mincemeat of the prosecution, winning fame as well as fortune. Unfortunately, Mickey discovers fairly soon that his client is evil. It was at this point I found myself thinking there was still half the book to go - focused on the evil Roulet, and I wished Connelly hadn't revealed him as the bad guy so soon. In addition, unlike Mickey, who's a well developed character, Roulet seems one-dimensional. I found my interest flagging, and didn't finish the book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read everything that Connelly has put to the page and over all would say that he consistantly pours out great novels. Over the last couple of years he has kind of gone down hill with his Bosch books. I say that because they started to go way over the top and read like a hollywood script for the next big budget action thriller with tons of explosions and little plot. So its nice that Connelly once again puts aside Bosch and starts a new character with Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer.The first half of this book is 5 stars all of the way. Haller has considerable depth of character and you will find yourself confronted by a legal world that Grisham could only dream of writing about. The story revolves around a 'franchise client', a client who will set up Haller with huge paychecks and elevate him for years to come through the publicity of the trial.PLOT SPOILER- This book falls apart when the 'franchise client' turns out to be the evilist man ever to walk the face of this earth and starts to play against Haller. First he kills Haller's best friend and associate investigator and then threatens Haller's family. What gets me is that Haller does not retaliate right away but instead calmly goes about the business of getting the client off. It's still well written, but I can't think of anyone who would have gone about his or her actions in a similar manner to Haller once the chips start to fall.END SPOILER-So with all of that aside, this book is well written throughout, my only fault is with some far fetched plotting by Connelly for about the last third of the book. Because of this its not his best work and if you have yet to read Connelly, I would point you in the direction of one of his other seminol books like 'Blood Work'."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller has spent all his professional life afraid that he wouldn't recognize innocence if it stood have been on the watch for was evil.Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer, a criminal defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, traveling between the far-flung courthouses of Los Angeles to defends clients of every kind. Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers--they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence---it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice.A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream. what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest of his career.Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal--this time to save his own life.The Lincoln Lawyer is a stunning display of novelistic mastery--as human, as gripping, and as whiplash-surprising as any novel yet from the writer Publisher's Weekly has called \\"today's Dostoyevsky of crime literature.\\""},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I listened to this book while traveling on business and was totally engrossed in the story. I love the Harry Bosch series, but I think that Connelly's greatest strength is actually his non-Bosch tales. Mickey Haller's development of conscience as the book progresses is obvious; his struggle between right and wrong is palatable. The story line is credible and exciting; it's refreshing not to have to suspend one's connection with reality in order to go along with the story.One slight caveat with listening to this book in the car: I have been driving for 32 years, and I got my first ticket ever while listening to \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\" If you do listen while driving, don't forget to look down and check your speedometer occasionally!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly steps off the streets of LA, and into it's court houses, writing a taut page turning legal thriller that brings to mind the best of Scott Turow or early John Grisham. Micky Haller is a criminal defense lawyer who will do whatever he needs to to get his clients off. However he gets more than he bargains for when he's faced with a client who might not be all he claims he is. Consequently, Micky finds himself struggling to defend himself, before he loses not only a case, but perhaps his life as well. A great read that manages to top even some of Connelly's fantastic Harry Bosch novels."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"If you are a suspense, mystery, and murder buff, this book is for you. I was so impressed with the writing of the author and he just had me guessing the whole time. There were so many different twists that I just kept getting shocked when my plots were so far off! I did not see the movie because I feel they always ruin the book. Movie can not do the justice a book can. This book lets your mind imagine and explore. I enjoyed the character of Mickey Haller and want to read more of his series. The other positive thing is that I got to think of Matthew McConnaughey which was very pleasing!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the first Michael Connelly book I have read. I really enjoyed it, and look forward to reading more of his books. The characters are easy to follow and to like. The ending was a surprise that I didn't see coming."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a great book. Much better than the movie which is usually the case. Always nice to be delivered to your Kindle so no problems with delivery."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is best known for his Detective procedural's revovling arround Harry Bosch and I've enjoyed that series pretty well up to the point I had read so I was interested to see what he could do with a story revolving around a lawyer and I have to say I was pretty pleased for the most part.I would have probably liked the story even more, in fact, if I had not read the Harry Bosch novels because there are a few too many similarities that makes it lfeel like this is a slight retread of one of those stories from time to time although the overall effect doesn't detract too much from the book.That being said, I thought the story was strong and the mysteries kept me guessing for the most part and I enjoyed the main character in this story about us much as I did Harry from his other series.All in all, this has all the strengths (and some of the weaknesses) of Connelly's other books and if you've enjoyed his books before, there's no reason you shouldn't thoroughly enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As soon as I started reading this book, I could totally picture Matthew McConaughey playing this part and this was well before the movie came out. It was amazing how much it reminded me of John Grisham and ALL the roles McConaughey has played.Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller is a sleazy defense attorney. His ex-wife is in the prosecutor's office and his second ex-wife is his secretary. How does he do that? Even though there is much to dislike about him, you can't help but fall for his charm.Haller is hired by a man accused of rape and murder. That case soon leads to the trail of a serial killer and ties in with another, older, case of Haller's. What I at first thought was going to be run-of-the-mill lawyer thriller turned into a story with more depth than my aunt's lasagna and with just as much spice.The entire book is one mystery within another that can only be solved through Haller's genius court skills, and it's doubtful he can pull the whole thing off. The book is at times humorous and sad but always full of action and suspense and left me with some hope for Haller in the next book (there has to be another!) And, like all good books, I doubt very much the movie can compete with such a great story."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was terrific! The person who does the reading does such a great job. You need to listen to it more than one time because you listen differently once you know what is going to happen. There are certain sections of the book that you will pick up the sarcasim and humor. Better than seeing the edited movie. The reader, when you give yourself time to think about it, does a fabulous job of changing his voice. Sent it to my brother after I read it & he told me it was his first time using audio book. He stayed up late because he had to finish the entire book. Really extraordinary & entertaining Connelly makes you feel like you are experiencing the book in real time."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw the movie before reading the book and of course the book was way better then the motion pictures in so many aspects. You go more in depth about the characters and deeper into the plot, Connelly does an amazing job writing this, I recommend this to everyone its a must read had me staying up late because I was so interested in it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"CD/Unabridged/Legal Thriller: So after listening to the craptuaular \\"Overlook\\", I put off listening to this one. I can't believe it was by the same author! This book is done in first person and Adam Grupper does a great job reading the narrative.The story is about a California defense lawyer, Mickey Haller, who has the job of finding a man not guilty of beating a prostitute. There are lots of twist and turns and our hero must do the right thing without getting disbarred. Mickey is smart and experienced in the courtroom and his antics bring a lot of entertainment to the story.I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I got this book when it was a kindle daily deal special and am I glad I did.......it held my attention thru out the entire book, as a matter of fact after reading The Lincoln Lawyer I HAD to get the other three books in the Mickey Haller series and the second book The brass verdict was AESOME...I usually can get pretty close to who did what...BUT in these books it was a SHOCKER to find out who the real culprit was...Mickey Haller is great... and Matt McConaghuey plays him perfectly in the movie which I plan on purchasing........."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Probably better than I thought since there is now a movie based on this novel. I found to be a bit tiresome in spots. Only MY opinion."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I don't normally read this genre, but was looking for something a little different recently and tried a few crime thrillers that I'd seen advertised with swooning reviews about how wonderful they were.But I couldn't read any of them. The writing quality was so poor it drew attention to itself, and the characters were unrealistic and unbelievable I just couldn't care or get involved.But this book ... this was the first (and, so far, only) keeper. The characters are realistic and believable, and the writing is good. Just as importantly, of course, the story itself is fantastic and exciting, despite not having a lot of physical action. I enjoyed the legal thought processes and maneuvering [thank goodness for spell check ...] and appreciate the fact that the author respects the intelligence of the reader. The mix of different cases going on at the same time made it seem more realistic, made me feel more as if I were riding along in that Lincoln.There is also a nice subplot with the ex-wife. When the ex-wife was first brought in I thought \\"Oh, no, here comes the soap opera\\" but to my surprise this aspect was actually very affecting. (There is another ex-wife as well, which for me was one ex-wife too many.)One weakness of the book for me was the scent of condescending racism. When a person of color is suspected of wrongdoing they end up being falsely charged, and even the ones that do a crime, well they \\"are just trying to get by, just to live with what they're given\\". Whereas a white person deserves the label of being \\"pure evil\\". Seems to me that there are good and bad people of all races.I will definitely check out more of this author's books!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read The Lincoln Lawyer by Michael Connelly after watching the movie. I haven't dipped into the mystery/crime thriller genre in a long while and thought it was about time! Both the book and movie impressed me both in characterization and plot organization.So, Mickey Haller isn't your typical male hero that comes in to solve the crime or save the day. He is a defense attorney - he fights for the bad (*ahem* allegedly) guys. When the case of a wealthy realtor falls in his lap, he thinks things are finally going his way. He gets a case guaranteed to make him a big pile of money and he thinks - for once - his guy might even be innocent. Of course, as I've come to learn, in the worlds that Michael Connelly writes in things are never what they seem - you have to go through a constantly twisting and winding journey to see where Mickey's case will eventually take him.So, even though Mickey doesn't come off as the type of guy you'd typically root for - I dare you not to fall under his spell just the same (and this isn't just a Matthew McConaughey movie flashback either). He does have his own special set of ethical guidelines - and even when he is skating legal and moral corners you can't help but be impressed by him. This man is wily. He is also a sucker for his daughter and ex-wife (sorry - make that ex-wives). He wants to be a family man but that role didn't work out for him since his woman of choice is a prosecutor that ultimately couldn't handle him fighting on the \\"wrong\\" side.As for the plot - Michael Connelly certainly delivers on that front, y'all. Not only do his books keep you in a constant state of anticipation, but the mysteries are engaging. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, it would be pretty much impossible to foresee all of them. Impressive stuff.So anyway, I read through the entire four book Mickey Haller series in a row - couldn't get enough! Can't wait to see where it goes next. I highly recommend both the movie and the book. I actually watched the movie first - which might have even made me appreciate the book's intricacies (and different ending) more. Definitely worth checking out, even if it isn't your normal genre!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I usually think I am pretty good with guessing the ending or the plot of a book or movie.

I HAD to find out what happened!I think I am going to start reading more Michael Connelly books!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Very good read.

There was something that went wrong in the translation to movie and I'm glad the book version picks up the slack and brings it home. The ending has a much better closer too."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The first of the Micky Haller series of courtroom dramas, the books that are destined to become a phenomenon.A typical Connelly mystery - tough, gritty and so realistic you have to watch over your back as you read just to make sure you don't end up on the witness stand.Truly. Great. Stuff."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This story was good and enjoyable, but I kept thinking that I had read it/heard it somewhere before. It is VERY similar to a Scott Turow novel. I can't tell you why without giving away the ending but you'll know once your done."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is Connelly's best book by far. It deserves the praise it gets, and he earned the loot it brought him. I loved it, and as one who dabbled for a while in criminal defense work, I would say he has nailed the critical contradictions of our adversary system in a highly readable way. By the way, in my opinion the movie is one of those few that doesn't butcher the book and is excellent in its own right."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Audiobooks must be examined in two ways, the strength of the writing and the strength of the narration. Lincoln Lawyer is one of the best legal thrillers to be released in some time. The writing is tight and the action engaging. As a plus, the book gives a pretty accurate description of life as an attorney, particularly a criminal defense attorney. The book moves at a great pace and the tension builds in a predictable but satisfactory manner.The narration by Adam Grupper is professional--meaning it's excellent. Rarely have I listened to an audiobook with such a compelling and interesting narrator. He manages to convey male and female characters without sounding foolish (very difficult for male narrators) as well as adding subtle differences to the speech of the characters. It's a fabulous audiobook for an engaging legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read a few Michael Connelly books and enjoyed them all. This was the best yet, in my opinion. Connelly doesn't use gimmicks or excessive adjectives to prove that he's a great writer; he just creates great characters with interesting plots and writes entertaining thrillers! The Harry Bosch books are written from an LAPD detective's point of view, and this book was written from the perspective of a defense attorney. He obviously does his research, giving us insider tidbits throughout the book that only a defense attorney would know about. Plain and simple, it was a fast-paced, entertaining book and it's gonna make a great movie!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer is a wonderful book.The story is enjoyable and the book is easy to read. What makes the book special are the small details that the author has inserted throughout. As a point of journalistic integrity, I must state that I have never practiced law in L.A. or in California. However, I've been a practicing lawyer in Ohio since, well, forever, and, over the years, I have represented (and prosecuted for legal ethics violations) a great many lawyers. So, if I may say so, I think I have a pretty good insight into the way the legal system (Mr. Connelly correctly refers to it as a \\"rusty machine\\")really works -- or doesn't work, depending on your point of view.Anyway, Mr. Connelly's numerous little details are right on target.For example,a lawyer who seeks a favor from a Sheriff's Deputy by seeking to show they know each other, while misstating the Deputy's name in the process (\\"Ouch!\\" I've seen it happen many times), seeking a delay in a case so that the search for a key witness (\\"Mr. Green,\\" i.e. payment from the client)can be found (I've heard about \\"Mr. Green,\\" many times), fee plans A (the fee the lawyer really wants and probably deserves) and plan B (the fee the lawyer, at a slow economic time, is willing to accept even if it is less than the lawyer probably deserves), secretly and illegally paying off bailbondsmen & others (yes, this really happens -- it stinks but it really happens)to direct potential clients to the lawyer, and on and on.Second point of journalistic disclosure, I practice almost no criminal law and I have not and never would violate any of the Ohio rules of legal ethics.(I think we can all agree on that one.) But I have eyes and ears. I see things. I hear things. And much of what I have seen and heard are in this book.If you want to have some fun and gain some real-life insight into how the legal system sometimes functions, read this book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is definately a great read! I just hope they haven't ruined the book for the movie. Very few movies equal the books, but I'll give the movie a shot.

This book proved impossible to put down between chapters as it maintained a high level of continuity throughout.

Definately a book worth buying."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Creating a new major character after Harry Bosch is a brave and successful move for Connelly. The challenge is to make a lawyer who's interesting given most are piranhas, and he pulls it off with the slightly unlikely but immensely appealing idea of a lawyer who works out of his car. The character's a little too dignified for a real bottom feeder, but apart from this it's a fine novel."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book was fantastic. Read it in 2 days...could NOT put it down. And this from someone who works with criminal defense lawyers!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was an enjoyable and fast paced read. It kept me glued and wondering where it was going to go next, although some parts of it you could figure out before they got there. The climax to me seemed to come more towards the end of the book and then just get wrapped up too quickly with things between Haller and Roulet. I think there could have been more twists and turns at that point and it could have been taken just a little bit farther. I was a tad disappointed with the ending, I felt that after all Michael Haller went through, he should have made a better career choice at the end ( hope I'm not giving too much away ). Now that I've read the book, I'm definitely ready to see the movie and I truly hope it lives up to the book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read this book just before the movie was released. I was(am) under the impression that making a movie out of this wonderful story will be quite challenging. Have heard great reviews about the movie too but I think I would love the book than the movie even if I have watched it. Definitely a page turner, it has got everything, some romance, family, suspense, mystery... everything you want in a legal thriller. I am going to follow Michael Connelly's work after this, have already collected few :-)"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When this book came out, Michael Connelly had written eleven Harry Bosch mystery novels beginning with The Black Echo in 1992 and ending with The Closers. The Lincoln Lawyer was his sixteenth novel and his first legal thriller. His mysteries have won numerous awards and been immensely successful. This terrific novel will only add to his reputation as a crafted storyteller.As an Abraham Lincoln fan, I admit that my first thought at reading the title of this book was that it was somehow linked to our 16th President. I was wrong. The novel focuses on criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, a \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, traveling between clients and courthouses in and around Los Angeles. His driver is a former client who is working off his legal bill after Mickey got him probation on a cocaine sales conviction.Mickey is a familiar figure to those who read legal thrillers - the clever but downtrodden criminal lawyer who defends society's misfits: con artists, drug dealers, bikers and thieves. Mickey is a tough, seasoned and thoroughly cynical lawyer at the beginning of the book. He still has some integrity left and always does a good job for his clients. Mickey knows that in criminal court it's not always about whether the client is guilty or innocent. More often than not, it's about what the state can prove and what advantages a lawyer can gain through negotiations and working the system.Mickey's plight of primarily representing low or even nonpaying clients is about to change. A rich Beverly Hills playboy is arrested for the attempted murder and rape of a woman he picked up in a bar. For reasons that aren't initially clear, he chooses Mickey to defend him. The case appears to be a defense lawyer's dream - a franchise case, one that's easy to win and has a high-paying client. Mickey explains it this way:Every attorney who works the machine has two fee schedules. There is Schedule A, which lists the fees the attorney would like to get for certain services rendered. And there is schedule B, the fees he is willing to take because that is all the client can afford. A franchise client is a defendant who wants to go to trial and has the money to pay his lawyer's schedule A rates. From first appearance to arraignment to preliminary hearing and on to trial and then appeal, the franchise client demands hundreds if not thousands of billable hours. He can keep gas in the tank for two to three years. From where I hunt, they are the rarest and most highly sought beast in the jungle.Naturally, everything about the case soon goes wrong. Someone close to him is murdered and Mickey suspects his new client is behind the killing. The case he so cherished having is introducing him to an evil he's never experienced. Soon, both his career and his life are on the line.This novel is colorful, fast-paced and filled with clever plot twists. Connelly spent several years, on and off, hanging out with lawyers in LA, and a judge allowed him full access to her courtroom to see how hearings and trials were conducted. As a result, for those who insist that legal thrillers should be as authentic as possible, the courtroom scenes are credibly presented and impart a good understanding of criminal procedures.This book would be the perfect thriller to read on a lazy summer day at the beach - or (more likely here in Maine) by a warm fireplace on a cold winter. Either way, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have not been a long time fan of Michael Connelly as have many of the other reviewers, so I can't compare this to his other books. I can say that I read legal thrillers all the time and this one is certainly excellent. I like the character of Mickey Haller and the other primary characters around him. Connelly did a great job of describing Louis Roulet, Mickey's main client in the novel, as pure evil. I could actually see his evil grin in my imagination by his description. The interplay between the two, especially through the second half of the book, was electric. The tension was built steadily with many different people and events interweaving more significantly as things progressed. All good thrillers so this and Connelly did this well bringing all of it to a satisfactory conclusion. The prologue tied up questions that I would otherwise have been left asking, yet also left me looking forward to the next Haller book. I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who likes any kind of thriller or suspense fiction."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I admit, I'm a Michael Connelly fan. I discovered him only in the past few years, after having read all the Elmore Leonard and James Lee Burke books available, and searching for a new mystery/crime writer who could actually write.Connelly is great at characterization and plot--never predictable or formulaic as, unfortunately, most other series writers in this genre often are.As much as I've enjoyed Connelly's other books though, I was blown away by The Lincoln Lawyer. This new character is so real, it feels as if he could walk right off the page. What can I say but, bravo? Looking forward to more."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Other than the Harry Bosch Novels, this is Connelley's best work ever. I was certainly impressed with the story and I believe you will be also. A real hard to put down book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As a first time Michael Connelly reader I was expecting the book to immediately hook me in. Unfortunately I found the first half of this book a bit slow, and the characters initially seemed predictable and unoriginal. However, I persevered and it started to seriously pick up pace around the half way mark. I found the second half of the book very enjoyable and hard to put down, and although you can guess at what the ending will be, the author keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how Mickey will get his plan to work. This is an easy, enjoyable read and if you like a good legal thriller then I would definitely recommend this book. I have given this book 4 stars, but my true rating is 3.5 - a faster start and more original characters would have bumped it up to a genuine 4, and the fast paced second half kept it from being a 3."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Abraham Lincoln is revered by lawyers everywhere for his courtroom skills and practical wisdom. The Lincoln Michael Connelly refers is not Abraham, but rather the automobile.Mickey Haller, son of an original Los Angeles superstar lawyer, owns several. At times the limousine business seems preferable to his own. But finally he gets, to his eternal regret the \\"franchise case\\", the kind of case that not only pays the bills but causes other clients to want his services.A young rich real estate broker is charged in the attempted murder of a hooker. His insistence in his innocence causes Haller to realize he may have what he has always dreaded, the actually innocent client. But he finds his defense efforts in disarray as the case sours, and he himself becomes a murder suspect.Non-lawyers usually do not write good legal thrillers. Michael Connelly, a former reporter and America's best mystery writer, is the exception that proves the rule. He has a great ear for the courtroom and a sense of the professional and economic dilemmas trial lawyers face.I will say this, however, in real life no matter how secret the client confidence, lawyers are ethically able to access the expertise necessary to know how to respond to any dilemma in an ethically sound way. The real Mickey Haller would have picked up the phone to the Bar's hotline for an ethics opinion. That simple act would have destroyed a helluva tale.I hope we will see more of Haller. He has his demons but he is not as dark a protagonist as Harry Bosch. The reality is, in his first legal thriller, Connelly has produced a book every bit as good as John Grisham's A Time To Kill. That is saying a lot."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a dirty-shirt criminal defense lawyer who cleans up well. He has a narrow life that is lived within the parameters of the criminal justice \\"machine\\". His friends are investigators, bail bondsmen, and other lawyers. His principal challenge is finding enough clients to enable him to make the mortgage payments and otherwise cope with the high cost of living in LA. That focus predisposes him to cut some ethical corners, ignore some people who should be more central to his life, and put aside questions about purpose and the higher good. It's all about the buck.The buck is all Mickey sees when he lands a wealthy client accused of assault and attempted rape. He worries that the case will be too easy, and his chance for a big score will evaporate in an early plea or a dismissal. However, that turns out not to be the case as Mickey's \\"franchise\\" client leads him through a troubling hall of mirrors that both continually distorts the truth and leaves Mickey staring at reflections of himself that he would rather not acknowledge.This novel is well written and imaginative, and contains some surprising plot twists. It also has some story elements that just don't hang together. There's no credible explanation for why exactly this case fell into Mickey's lap. The surprise climax left me saying, \\"aw, c'mon!\\" In the end, the solution was a lot short of what I stayed up until 3 in the morning hoping to see revealed.But then again, the story did keep me up reading until 3 in the morning. That doesn't happen often. Despite its flaws, this is a book to recommend."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This novel is definitely on a par with the best of the fifteen stories in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series; any initial disappointment that might be experienced by Bosch's fans when they discover that Connelly has at least temporarily abandoned Harry in favor of Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney whose seemingly guilty clients often benefit from police errors, will almost immediately be replaced by the recognition that Connelly has created another character at least as complex and interesting as Harry. Mickey's persona is almost the opposite of Harry's, for him the law is about the art of the possible, his clients are often individuals who are down on their luck and on the wrong side of the law. Harry concentrates on identifying the guilty in order to provide justice for the victims and their families; Mickey is afraid that some day he will be hired to defend a client whose innocence he will be incapable of recognizing and thus he will simply pursue the \\"best deal\\" as opposed to throwing all his effort into gaining a \\"not guilty\\" verdict.The story opens with Mickey receiving a telephone call from Fernando Valenzuela (no, not the pitcher, but the bail bondsman) in his office while on his way to a court hearing for Harold Casey, a member of the Road Saints motorcycle gang who is awaiting trial on multiple drug and weapons charges. (The Lincoln Town Car which is his office is an integral element both in his life and also eventually becomes an important detail in the particular case which is at the center of this story.) Valenzuela alerts Mickey to the possibilty of a potential \\"franchise case\\", a big money case involving a high profile client who has been booked for aggravated assualt, gross bodily injury, and attempted rape and who is interested in having Mickey represent him. As Mickey investigates the case, he quickly decides that his defense of Louis Roulet, a Beverly Hills real estate salesman, will be one of the easiest cases of his career and in fact it may never even get to trial and thus deprive him of both the big payday and the publicity which he had hoped to receive. Several unexpected twists quickly occur, and when one of Mickey's good friends is murdered he realizes that instead of worrying about failing to recognize innocence when it confronts him, for the first time in his career he may instead be in mortal danger from the pure evil which is apparently behind the attack for which his client is on trial. All this is foreshadowed wonderfully very early in the book by the following brief injection of Mickey's mental commentary (the story is written entirely in the first person);\\"Much of society thought of me as the devil but they were wrong. I was a greasy angel. I was the true road saint. I was needed and wanted. By both sides. I was the oil in the machine. I allowed the gears to crank and turn. I helped keep the engine of the system running.But all of that would change with the Roulet case. For me. For him. And certainly for Jesus Menendez.\\"And during the rest of the story, as Mickey defends Roulet and we gradually discover who Jesus Menendez is and his relevance to this case, we watch the juxtaposition of guilt and innocence and the clash of good and evil as the assumptions at the heart of Mickey's existence are threatened. As the title of Part Two so deftly summarizes , Mickey has entered \\" a world without truth.\\"We also are gradually introduced to the important people in Mickey's life - his dead father (a lengendary defense attorney), his two ex-wives (both with central roles in this story) and the young daughter who he has neglected due to the press of his caseload. As the book proceeds, Connelly's meticulous research provides the reader with the same type of interesting detail regarding the legal system which the Bosch series provided regarding police procedures. (And as a bonus, Connelly's knowledge of detective work makes that aspect of this story very realistic.) Furthermore, the explicit and implicit observations about human nature and the human condition which are embedded throughout THE LINCOLN LAWYER added immensely to my enjoyment of the story. Several of Mickey's small time clients not only prove essential to the Roulet case as it unfolds but are intesting in their own right.So this book is highly recommended, both for Michael Connelly fans and as an introduction to his work for new readers. Whether Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller eventually meet or the two series remain on totally independent tracks, It appears that the author has created interesting enough characters to form the basis for many future bestsellers. For the past several years my favorite legal procedurals are the series created by John Lescroart involving lawyer Dismas Hardy and detective Abraham Glitsky. These novels successfully combine background case development and courtroom drama with truly interesting characters (Abe, Diz and their associates, friends and families) whose lives are an integral element in the stories. This book is on a par with the best stories in that series, and should be very enjoyable for fans of both Connelly and Lescroart and in fact for all readers of legal thrillers.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller seems to be a good man. Like anyone, he has his flaws and he does what he can to make a living as a defense attorney. He confides that his father, who was also an attorney, had a place in his heart for helping the less fortunate. Many of these clients were women who resorted to prostitution as a desperate choice to survive. Mickey tries to follow his father's example.Mickey does much of his work from the back seat of his Lincoln. His driver, Earl, is working off his fee for Mickey's successful defense in a case against him.As the story progresses, Mickey is asked to defend wealthy real estate agent Louis Roulet from the accusation of aggravated assault and attempted rape against Reggie Campo, a woman Roulet met in a bar.From the start, Mickey is skeptical of Roulet when he catches him in a number of lies about his past. Then, when Mickey sees a photo of Reggie, she bears a close resemblance to a young woman that Mickey's former client Jesus Mendez, was sent to prison for killing.Mendez maintained his innocence and now Mickey wonders if Mendez could really be innocent. Mickey visits Mendez in jail and brings a number of photos, one of which is Rolet. What Mickey learns is that he's now dealing with a truly evil person.The novel proceeds as the author, Michael Connelly, sets the parts in motion as if he is directing a play. Roulet is able to create a special reason for Mickey to win the case and set him free but he also admits to things in his past. Since there is an attorney-client privilege, Mickey cannot use this against Roulet.To say that the award winning novel was well done is an understatement. The reader becomes involved in the story as if the reader was sitting in the front row of the jury box. We observe Mickey and wonder how he will provide justice for Roulet, a man he is defending."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly has written the perfect courtroom drama, this book is every bit as good as anything John Grisham wrote, back when he was on top of his game. Fans of Connelly's acclaimed Harry Bosch series will not be disappointed with this deviation away from Mr. Bosch. Connelly is demonstrating once again his fertile imagination and gifted story telling ability.The Lincoln Lawyer is the story of a defining case in the life of a defense attorney surfeited by the excess of lowlifes around which his entire practice as been maintained. Twice divorced and cynical attorney Mickey Haller is that lawyer, and his biggest self-described fear is that he won't recognize an innocent client when hired by one. Somewhat of a contradiction, Mickey is in fact a principled lawyer who plays by the rules. The fact that his clients are all guilty doesn't seem to trouble him as much as mistakes made by the legal authorities, who arrest, investigate, and prosecute. Haller likens the prosecution's case to a set of spinning plates precariously balanced atop a thin dowel. In his mind, all Haller needs to do is knock one of those spinning plates down and the whole prosecution case crumbles with it. In Lincoln Lawyer, Haller believes he may have finally found an innocent client, not only that, but a wealthy client actually able to pay for a first class defense. Once committed to the defense Haller slowly discovers that unlike the bumbling rogues, scallywags, and ne'er-do-wells of his past, his new client may well be the very essence of evil, a man to truly fear. Not only is Haller's life in danger, so too are the lives of those closest to him.Expertly crafted plot with characters that are well defined. This book flows seamlessly from one scene to the next and keeps you in the story with short intense chapters that make it impossible to put aside. And if just one measure of a good a book is how satisfied it leaves the reader, then this book is certainly one of the year's best. It is a book of suspense and drama that literally personifies the genre."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When I learned that Michael Connelly had determined to pen a legal thriller, I was more than a little worried. Here was the author who had delivered superlative Harry Bosch novels like The Closers, now stepping onto ground trodden nearly lifeless by the likes of Grisham and Martini.To my delight, The Lincoln Lawyer turned out to be an excellent, gritty and powerful novel. Twice divorced and haunted by ghosts of lost cases past, cynical and ethically indistinct criminal lawyer Mickey Haller is a fine invention, at once fascinating, witty and sympathetic. I rather hope this unique character becomes Connelly's next Harry Bosch. (Promisingly, Haller is Bosch's half brother.)The writing here is equal to or perhaps even better than Connelly's previous works, at times lyrical and nearly poetic, yet never encumbering superb storytelling. Mickey Haller's behind-the-scenes manipulations add sparkle to the courtroom drama, and a highly inventive twist is The Lincoln Lawyer's piece de resistance.If you enjoy the richly researched detail and beautiful prose spun around the fabulous pageturner that is The Lincoln Lawyer, I also highly recommend Connelly's The Closers and The Poet as well as Mute by newcomer Brad Steel."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book by talented author, Michael Connelly, kept me pinned to my seat all Saturday night. I intended to go to a movie with friends, but couldn't put this book down long enough to dress.I really like GOOD books about \\"lawyering,\\" especially when they're woven into other aspects of the community so well. This is a psychological thriller that you won't want to miss.An outstanding, original concept by a master writer.Buy it! You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have long been a fan of Michael Connelly. As far as I'm concerned Connelly is in the top five of modern-day mystery writers. With each book I say to myself that \\"he just can't top this one.\\" And I continue to be wrong. And The Lincoln Lawyer is no exception. It just has to be the absolute best Michael Connelly novel ever!Criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer; meaning he works out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car. He's never sure if he would be able to recognize innocence if it stood in front of him. And he's not necessarily concerned whether his clients are innocent or not.A wealthy Beverly Hills realtor is arrested for attacking a woman in her home. This type of client is what Mick Haller calls a 'franchise case.' It's a big payday and the case appears to be an easy one. But after someone close to Mick is murdered, things become murky before they clear up. Mick is facing down pure evil and he'd better be at the top of his game if he wishes to get out of this case alive.Armchair Interviews says: The Lincoln Lawyer has everything; great characters, scintillating plot, action, evil, gritty issues, ex-wives and a hero who is unlikely. It is a 15 on a score of one to ten!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is one of those novels where the reviewers on this site simply give too much away- you will enjoy this book so much more if you don't read all the detailed reviews and let the twists and turns surprise you!!!Its a great, fast-paced, exciting legal novel with all the elements for a fun and enjoyable read that you won't be able to put down!As a litigator, I usually shy away from reading this genre (as you can tell by my reviews, most of which are historical fiction), but this wasn't too far-fetched and he clearly has a grasp of the legal system, detective work, and the way things \\"go down,\\" so to speak. This was my first Michael Connelly novel and I am pleasantly surprised- really looking forward to reading more from this amazing writer."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read over 150 mystery/thrillers in 2005 and I considered this to be the best one I read that year.In this legal thriller, Connelly does everything right -- plot, characters, everything. I practiced law in Los Angeles for six years, and I consider the legal procedures in this novel to be highly realistic. This book is gritty, but so is criminal law in real life. This beats anything by Grisham or Turow. The trial scene at the end of the book is tremendously well done.In particular, I recommend the audio version of this book, read by the excellent Adam Grupper. This is, quite simply, one of the best audiobooks that I have ever listened to. I normally don't enjoy audiobooks, but this one was first-rate.Highly recommended to anybody who enjoys legal thrillers or thrillers in general."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"He gets the attitude and the fears of some of the defense bar right.

Well done."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I was worried this might be a bit of cheesy beach read -- but it is much better than that. This book is clever, actually says something about the legal system without completely hitting you over the head with it, and pretty much dead on with some of the courtroom and attorney/client dialogue. (I'm a trial lawyer in Los Angeles, as well.) Although I have liked the few Turow and Grisham books I have read, I think I like this book better."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have to admit...I was hesitant about reading this book. I debated about buying it a while before actually purchasing. And then I bought it soley out of my growing respect for Michael Connelly's excellent attention to detail and his obvious knowledge of police procedures and investigative techniques. Simply put, this guy knows his stuff. So I bought it despite the fact that I'm not to big on legal thrillers. And I have to say, Connelly strikes again. I never should have doubted him. His Mickey Haller is every bit as witty, dark, and human as the legendary Harry Bosch. This was a fully fleshed out character from start to finish. No central casting here. And the biggest pleasure that I got from the book was getting an insiders view of courtrrom procedure. Definitely and eye-opener..and very clever. A+++"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have loved the Harry Bosch books over the years. This time Connelly takes a break from the Bosche character, but comes up with another classic anti hero in attorney Micky Haller. 'The Lincoln Lawyer' is about the eccentric Haller, who operates in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, and instead of an office he does business out of his Lincoln Town car. Mickey does not follow accepted legal ethics operating on the outskirts of the law, which puts him at odds with the establishment. Micky's courtroom scenes are when the fireworks really fly! And his behind the scenes manipulations make for a great page turner. Connelly has a gift for developing characters which make his books more interesting to read then the typical thriller. If you like the Harry Bosche books then should like 'the Lincoln Lawyer!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Read the book and loved it - BUT - I found out after-the-fact that this book is not Kindle enabled...meaning that I can not share this book with my daughter who is also a Kindle user.

Although there were a few holesin the story they didn't spoil the ride."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer was the first book I have read of Michael Connelly and I will definitely look for his books again. As so many others have indicated, I thought that Mickey Haller was just a sleazy lawyer, but as I read, I felt that the thing he liked best about the law was less about getting his clients off with the best defense, than about outwitting the prosecution and making them stay on their toes. He liked to poke holes in the prosecution's case. He was almost caught in his own trap and ultimately had to rely on the prosecution to understand the underlyingfacts to save his own skin. I have always enjoyed mysteries, but this was about the best I have read to date. The characters were complex and never revealed too soon. I really liked Mickey and hope to read more about him in the future."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Defense attorney Mickey Haller isn't sure anymore what he wants, except for more money. After 15 years in practice, he's lost sight of many of the ideals that attracted him to the law in the first place. Now he's reached that point in life where he begins to take a long, hard look at himself, and finds a few very large flaws. But one think Mickey still believes is that every defendant deserves his day in court with competent representation.Hired by the wealthy, spoiled son of a real estate dynasty to defend him against rape/attempted murder charges, Mick is thrilled to finally have a chance to make the big bucks. What he doesn't realize until it's too late is that this is the case of his life, in more ways than one. In the three months from arraignment to verdict, Mick must come to terms with himself, his little daughter, and his own ethical foundation. And he risks all.This would have been rated 5 stars were it not for the difficulty I encountered trying to get into the heart of this book. On or about page 150, I was hooked, and raced through to the riveting conclusion. So if you find your mind wandering at first, keep going. Your perseverance will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The most interesting thing about The Lincoln Lawyer is that the cleverness of the plot idea strikes you as soon as you get to the end of the book. Not to reveal any spoilers but Mickey Haller is not quite the venal legal practitioner he appears to be up until that point; and you knew he had a \\"plan\\", you just didn't know what it could be. I was quite impressed at Connelly's presentation of the lawyers/judges thought processes and behavior in and out of the courtroom. He presents what seems to be a very realistic portrait of the criminal law profession, even though his own background is in journalism, not law.The bad guy, Louis Roulet, was truly a scary character because he was superficially such a normal guy, but you knew that under the surface a hideous monster lurked ready to break out when things didn't go his way, or his psychosis broke through. The ending of the book was also a surprise, though I think it would have been even better and more suspenseful if Roulet had been stalking his prey at the end and been foiled by Haller or by Maggie, rather than how the novel actually ended.The book was quite heavy on dialogue and this being the first Michael Connelly novel I've read, I was impressed by the fact that his writing is quite spare of the metaphors and lengthy \\"colorful\\" setting descriptions many other more literary writers of crime fiction use. He just tells the story - period. He does, however, crank out a pretty good story that keeps your interest until the end."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I bought this book because I read all of Connelly's other books and was impressed. This book is no different. It introduces Mickey Haller, a lawyer who operates from the backseat of a Lincoln. Haller is portrayed as unscrupulous and just cares about winning cases, however, later in the book, he is seen as a devoted father and likable ex-husband.The story is centered around Mickey and his client Roulet who is charged with assaulting a working girl. Upon investigating the case however, many truths about Roulet come to light and a past case haunts him as well. The plot development of this story is excellent and Connelly takes us through many twists and turns and ends the story with a bang."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly has put aside, for the moment, his Harry Bosch novels and stepped into the world of the \\"legal thriller.\\" I'm sorry he waited this long to do it.Mickey Haller is a \\"Lincoln lawyer.\\" That does not mean that Lincoln was his idol or that he was elected to some prestigious group. What it means is that Mickey uses a Lincoln Towne car as his office and his mode of transportation amongst the various court houses in the LA area. After 15 years of practice, whatever high ideals about the law he may have had have pretty much gone by the wayside. In his opinion \\"the law is a large rusting machine that sucks up people and lives and money. I am just a mechanic and I have become expert at going inside the machine and fixing things and extracting what I need from it in return.\\"In this artfully crafted story, Haller is retained to represent a young man who is alleged to have assaulted and attempted to rape his victim. However, as he investigates the case, doors from the past open and he is eventually confronted with one of the most delicious legal delemnas an attorney can confront. To try and outline the story here would only spoil it for you later. The writing is powerful and the court room action is authentic.This is a tale which will hold your attention from beginning to end and leave you looking for Mr. Connelly's next excursion into this type of fiction."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Don't let the name fool you.

However, all is not as it seems. Louis is not as innocent as he claims and as Mickey's relationship with his client deteriorates, bad things start to happen to him. Suddenly Mickey realizes that he has seen an innocent man, a man he represented two years prior, who is now serving life in San Quentin but Rolet realizes it also.Not even the mention of Harry Bosch in The Lincoln Lawyer and yet The Lincoln Lawyer is still a compelling novel that ingratiates itself into your psyche. The Lincoln Lawyer is the sixteenth novel by Michael Connolly, a prolific and novel, mystery novelist.

But Roulet's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens Haller because, despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not, Haller becomes convinced of his client's innocence. He recalls his deceased father's advice to other lawyers, \\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client.\\" Haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man.It's only when Haller recognizes the startling similarities in appearance between the victim, Campeau, and Martha Rentoria, the victim of Jesus Menendez, one of Haller's former clients (who is now cooling his heels for life in San Quentin for that particular murder) that Haller begins to scratch his head and investigate Roulet's case more deeply. All is not as it seems as Haller not only wrestles with legal ethical dilemmas but even finds himself in the disturbing position of being investigated as a suspect for the very assault for which he is defending Roulet. Even his family has been threatened and Haller must take action to protect his daughter and ex-wife, to resolve his ethical legal dilemmas, to clear his own name as a suspect, to free Menendez from what he now knows is an unjust conviction and, in the bargain, to snag the mastermind behind the whole twisted mess! A tall order indeed but Connelly has proven that he is up to the task. He's also tossed in a beautiful plot twist at the very point where a reader would be convinced all was in hand.It's difficult to expect much more out of any crackerjack suspense novel.Characters are marvelously developed - the baddie in the piece is portrayed as truly evil and abhorrent (in fact, you can almost feel the shivers going up and down your back when Haller recoils from his simple touch); Fernando Valenzuela, the bail bondsman, and Raul Levin, Haller's crack investigator, are wonderfully down to earth and realistic; Maggie McPherson, Haller's ex-wife, is portrayed as a skilled competent prosecutor but also frequently lapses into a man's stereotypical bitchy ex-wife. Even Teddy Vogel, a top lieutenant in the Road Saints motorcycle gang is colourfully portrayed and jumps completely alive off the page! Dialogue is realistic and credible. Connelly's expertise in the legal field is obvious as he gives us an extraordinary insider's look at the procedural machinations of both the defense and prosecution sides of the law system as well as the official police and unofficial defense investigation of a crime.Grisham, Baldacci, Tannenbaum - look to your laurels! There is a new star in the firmament of legal thrillers and his name is Michael Connelly. It will be a sad day indeed if Connelly doesn't reach the decision to bring Haller and his team back again for our enjoyment.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I loved this story. Connelly grabs the attention of the reader on the first page and invites them into the life of one of L.A.'s most reputable defense lawyers, Michael (Mickey) Haller. Haller is a street-smart, hard-hitting defense lawyer. He knows the professional ropes and which way to pull them. Haller is a Lincoln man with a whole fleet in his garage. Connelly grips the wheel of a Lincoln and takes the reader on an intriguing journey through the back street, court room, jail and into the life and lifestyle of a brilliant defense attorney.Connelly has an intriguing writing style that pulls the reader into the plot with Haller until you feel like you're cruising the streets of L.A. in the Lincoln with him. Haller captures the reader's loyalty by revealing his inner-most thoughts as he maps out legal strategy that unfold precisely like a delicate silk hanky. And like that hanky, wrinkles are inevitable even in the best laid plans. Haller finds this out when someone he is close to is murdered as the plot thickens. Haller has no clues to the murder, but the one the victim leaves.Haller works hard to secure the best possible outcome for all his clients. Like a quantitative analyst, he measures the options and weighs the outcomes of each possible course of action to take in determining the best defense strategy. Many of Haller's clients professed to be innocent, but Haller could always see through them. He's a meticulous lawyer who is methodical and successful at removing emotion from his professional decisions. He knows his strengths and his weaknesses. With all these qualifications, Haller has a fear of not being able to recognize an innocent client, until one day he discovers there is something far worse-not being able to recognize an evil one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first Michael Connelly novel and I was not let down. Connelly's prose is dynamic as each chapter is cleverly woven into the next.Mickey Haller is a successful LA defense lawyer highly regarded by others in his field and somewhat despised by the DA's office and LA police. In this fast paced thriller Mickey defends a \\"franchise client,\\" one who has more than enough money for legal costs, on charges of battering a local prostitute. Upon investigation, Mickey soons learns his client may not be so innocent, in fact, perhaps maybe be evil incarnate.Once you get into the book it will be difficult to put it down."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly novel. I thought it was an outstanding story with well developed characters, a plot that draws you along nicely, and plenty of good suspense. I'm an attorney and I'm comfortable saying that the courtroom scenes were also well done. Connelly's writing is hands down superior to that of Grisham, who tells a good story but is by no means gifted in use of the English language."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a stand alone book for Michael Connelly and what an outstanding effort it was. Because of my profession, I have no sympathy for defense lawyers; but I put my feeling on hold for this book. Mickey Haller was a really good guy. Still loves his two ex wives but especially Hayley, his daughter.What deep feelings you must have (besides the money) to defend the slugs of the earth, is beyond me but someone has to do it, and Haller does it well. Admittedly, I was not hooked until after I read a third of the book. Then, something happens to absolutely hook you for the rest of the book. Each chapter ended with the impetus to read the next one.The courtroom scenes were outstanding and one really gets a taste of its functions. I didnt catch the 'hook' until Mickey did and I loved it. I was too engrossed with the mystery to see it coming. A bonus for me!!I will read Michael Connelly's others from time to time. Robert Crais also does stand alone's wonderfully too. A truly worthwhile book; well written, intense and justice does prevail - eventually. What a trip!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the author's first foray into the legal thriller genre. He has already proven himself a master of the police procedural with his marvelous Harry Bosch series. This novel introduces California criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, a man with two ex-wives and an eight-year-old daughter named Hayley. Mickey is known as a sleazy lawyer who lives on the edge, barely managing to make ends meet by defending drug dealers, junkies, and an occasional accused murderer.To Mickey, \\"the law was not about truth. It was about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\" It is a good day for Mickey when he gets a guilty client off on a technicality. He enjoys punching holes in the prosecution's cases and the cops and district attorneys hate his guts. Mickey's most deep-seated fear is one that he inherited from his father, who was a prominent lawyer for almost thirty years--the fear of failing to protect an innocent client from being sent to prison.Haller, who does much of his work out of his Lincoln Town Car, is now busier than ever. He has a new client named Louis Roulet, who was arrested for aggravated assault and attempted rape, and the suspect's family is filthy rich. When Roulet asks Haller to represent him, the lawyer immediately sees dollar signs dancing before his eyes. This might be the big score, or as Mickey likes to say, \\"the gift that keeps on giving,\\" with legal fees that could climb well into the six figures. Little does Mickey know that by taking this case, he will be jeopardizing his career as well as his life. The unexpected fallout will change the way that Mickey views himself and the law forever.Connelly does a masterful job of setting up an intricate narrative that features believable characters, crisp dialogue, and compelling courtroom scenes. \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is funny, brash, cynical, suspenseful, and at times, shocking. I have some reservations about the plot, which has gaping holes that are never filled. However, this is a book with bite. It is an entertaining, thought-provoking, and immensely satisfying novel that is sure to be huge hit."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of The Lincoln Lawyer since Connelly's last novel (The Closers) made its way to the bookshelves in May of this year. I was a late-comer to Michael Connelly and his detective series and had spent the beginning of 2005 reading all of his work after stumbling into The Harry Bosch Novels: The Black Echo, the Black Ice, The Concrete Blonde. I was quickly hooked. Naturally, I ran out and purchased The Lincoln Lawyer upon its release. It did not disappoint.The Lincoln Lawyer is a man who goes by the name Mickey Haller. He is a criminal defense attorney (or criminal defense attorney) whose father had been an esteemed defense attorney himself before his death. Mickey's law office is not in some posh high rise office building - he works out of his Lincoln towncar, in which he's escorted around the streets of LA to defend a multitude of hustlers.Mickey lands a \\"franchise client\\" when he agrees to represent Louis Roulet. Roulet has been accused of attempted rape and murder of a prostitute, but proclaims his innocence. While digging deeper into the case, Mickey is haunted by the memory of Jesus Menendez - a man Mickey had represented. Mickey believed Jesus was innocent, but he was convicted and sentenced to prison. See, to Mickey, the system wasn't about guilt or innocence, it was about working the case and figuring out how to get a desired result: reasonable doubt. But all of that was about to change.While investigating Roulet's case, one of Mickey's colleagues is murdered in his home - a murder that sends the case into overdrive and threatens the lives of Mickey and his family.Connelly, as always, does a fine job of bringing his characters to life in this, his first attempt at a legal thriller - his first attempt at dealing with crimes from the other side of the aisle. Harry Bosch has shown us the criminal justice system from the 'order' side, and now Mickey Haller lets us take a look at the system from the 'law' side.Connelly's pacing is superb and the twists and turns of the story are perfectly paired with revelations about Mickey and his past - one wrought with uncertainty, guilt, and a couple of ex-wives. Connelly is a master of character development and with Mickey Haller (as well as the numerous secondary characters) there's no exception.The attention to detail and inclusion of such details - like the role of rap music in the LA streets and how Mickey listens to rap to familiarize himself with the world in which his clients live - is fantastic (and expected from Connelly).As with Connelly's other works, I did not want to put this one down. My only complaint (if I had to lodge one) is that the ending was a bit on the anti-climactic side, but that is necessary to keep it believable.I give The Lincoln Lawyer five stars and hope that Mickey Haller will emerge as Connelly's newest 'series' character. The Menendez case would be a great second novel in the Haller series..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Connelly proves he can do no wrong with a legal thriller that blows Grisham, Martini and company out of the water. This has all the authenticity, grit and soul of the Bosch series, it's just presented from the other side of the system.[...]"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Overall, this book was a quick and easy read with some enjoyable passages. The storyline was a fairly standard one for crime thrillers - a defense attorney is handling multiple cases which he discovers are related and which he must solve without the help of the police. A couple plot twists prevent it from being overly unoriginal, but I still felt the story was too predictable. I never really had a genuine feeling of suspense.Mickey Haller is a defense attorney who makes a living in Los Angeles mostly from defending gang members, drug dealers/users, and prostitutes. He's been in the business long enough to be jaded, with an attitude of being in it just for the money. One of his two marriages didn't last because she is a prosecutor who can't understand how he can defend criminals for a living. His business has its ups and downs; he is presented with a wealthy client who could be a \\"franchise\\" - one who pays him enough money for his services for him to live off of for quite awhile. Louis Roulet is a real estate agent whose mother owns the agency; he is also accused of rape and attempted murder by a prostitute. With the help of Raul Levin, a close friend and private investigator, Mickey has to work on solving the crime because the police already assume they have it all pinned on Roulet.Things get much more complicated when Mickey notices some similarities between this case and a murder case he worked years ago. Before long he realizes who the killer is and his life becomes threatened as well. Somehow I never truly felt the threat against Mickey and his family though - it just seemed like a foregone conclusion they would be fine. Some characters were better fleshed out than others and perhaps if they had developed the killer more, the threat would've felt more credible. One of the characters likened the killer to the devil, but that description didn't hold up for me. Maybe if the descriptions of the killer along with his motivations (or lack thereof) were more detailed, it would've felt more real."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As a practicing criminal lawyer for 32 years, I have routinely been disappointed in books about lawyers (and sometimes by them as well) where the rules of procedure and of ethics are ignored to \\"create\\" an interesting story that could simply never happen. Mickey Haller is a believable character and his \\"team\\" of consultants coached him well enough to please even me. If you can swallow the possibility that a talented defense lawyer can successfully get along with two ex-wives who still care for him, it is a short hop to believing that he can conduct his practice out of his small fleet of Lincolns.Beyond that, this was a good story about a character who is \\"fleshed out\\" well - even in a book that moves briskly. Thank you, Mr. C."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer is a fast-paced, thoroughly entertaining read. I was genuinely stunned by the twist, having not yet been spoiled by movie reviews or promos. The story and all the wonderful characters, the virtuous and the not, were believable. OK there was a little predictability here and there, but not too much and there was nothing to jar attention away from this exciting story. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Amazon is usually really good at recommending books to me. I go a recommendation for this book about two weeks ago, I love court dramas, growing up in a family affectionately known as \\"Law & Order\\" does that for you. I got the book on cd, because there was quite a wait list for it at the library, sorry, if I don't know the author, I don't buy the first book I read. Wow! That is what I can say about this book, wow! There is such a depth to the characters that I could actually find myself thinking, this or that character reminds me of the judges and attorneys that I know. This book never got boring, and I kept waiting for it too. I have never really thought about the other side of defense attorneys, my sister is the PD in my hometown, Mickey Haller, is a favorite. And I am now, buying Michael Connelly novels, because I think he is a very engaging writer. There is action, lots of suspense, and the always so necessary \\"WHAT THE ??!!\\" moment, which is requisite when writing in this genre. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book hooked me from page one and I ended up devouring it in 3 days. Smoothly and vividly written with a couple of wicked twists, and a great character in slightly amoral, but likeable, defense attorney Michael Haller. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Lincoln Lawyer has an element that can turn an ordinary mystery into a classic book: a character who grows. Attorney Michael Haller's essential goodness emerges in the course of the story. Not an easy thing for a writer to handle believably and naturally. Michael Connelly does it wonderfully well and without boring us for a single page. I don't remember many of the mysteries I've read. I remember Lincoln Lawyer fondly. [Edited review:] I've now re-read Lincoln Lawyer several times, with enjoyment. I've read all the classics - Crais, Parker, Chandler, Joseph Heywood (underappreciated!), etc., and consider Lincoln Lawyer the best mystery ever written."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"How do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you've ever read? This was a well-paced, highly entertaining story, but the book's real success is its longevity. You continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it. Hands down, this is Connelly's best novel. Few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end.Mick Haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works. To him, it's a machine, and he's the \\"greasy angel\\" who keeps it well oiled. Even though Haller's cynicism is a constant source of amusement, his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence. Then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client, who can pay top dollar. Accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman, Louis Roulet hires his services. What first seems to be a straight forward case, will ultimately test Haller to his limits: his family will be threatened, he will be accused of a crime, and someone very close to him will die. Not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system, the writing is first-rate."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book was EXCELLENT. It kept me interested from beginning to end; you will not want to put it down. All the characters played excellent roles in the book; you know exactly what their purpose is for without any confusion.

The twist, suspense, everything keeps you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I picked up this book at random one day, looking for a new author. I was more than pleasantly surprised. This is now one of my favorite books and authors. It is now the standard that I judge other books against.There are a few spots in this book where the author managed a plot twist that totally surprised me, and it's been a long time since I read any other book that did that.Pick this one up. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This stand alone featuring Mickey Haller as L.A. criminial defense attorney is nothing short of terrific from first page to last.The novel moves at a refreshingly fast pace with every page seemingly containing action or important information pivotal to the overall story.It is a riveting thriller, a great police procedural and courtroom drama nothing short of what could be real.In the end, once you close the book, you want to pick up another novel at least as good as this one, and hope it delviers. This one's a benchmark. (BTW, I chose another of Connelly's, The Concrete Blonde, which I am thus far enjoying).Connelly does it right and on The Lincoln Lawyer, he knocks this hit out of the park. If you like thrillers with a great story and sharp characters, don't hesitate getting The Lincoln Lawyer."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is a very good writer. His plots flow, he knows how to keep you reading with lots of twists and turns, and his research is impeccable. Unfortunately, while this book is a great look into the life of a not-always-ethical criminal defense lawyer, there are big gaps in the logic of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\" Without giving anything away... our hero is threatened by a bad guy, and the hero then proceeds to do nothing about it, even though it's clear the bad guy could show up again at any time. Also, there are many characters introduced in the first third of the book who have great potential (bike gang, Earl the Driver) but who never go anywhere. I will continue to read Connelly's books because his writing is far better than most of the soggy mess that passes for mystery fiction. But this isn't a 4 1/2 star book (as the current conglomeration of reviews on Amazon shows)."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thought the book was great. I hated to end it!

I have read most of his books and this one is a little different and is a very good read. You can be assurred that you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"It's a shame that an author with such a fun story to tell, and who wrote the first half of this book so well, decided to put so little effort into his courtroom scenes towards the end. Let me put it bluntly, and without spoiling anything: the trial scenes are just awful. No experienced trial advocate would ever act like Mickey Haller in court, especially on cross (Rule #1: you never ask an open-ended question on cross. Rule #2: you *only* hard-lead when you're crossing a cop. Rule #3: in case you didn't pick up on this, you do not ask a \\"why\\" question on cross). Connelly obviously didn't even take the time to run a draft of those chapters by somebody who's been in the game. What's worse is that he didn't need to: books on trial ad are easy to find. I get making your protagonist unconventional, and that there's very little consensus on the \\"best courtroom style,\\" but there are tactics and then there are basics.While that's easily the worst thing in the book, it also spotlights all the other little things that would otherwise be easy to ignore (like the fact that neither lawyer seems to have any problem with the other leading their own witnesses during direct, even though never objecting to it when it's constantly happening makes the judge think you're asleep at the wheel). I know it's his first legal thriller, but still.I got to Chapter 28 really engaged, and then I just had to put the book down. It yanked me so hard out of the story the book was hard to pick it back up. Hopefully they hired a consultant for the movie."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The plot is good. But, other than feeding the ego of an L.A. Judge and a couple of cops, this book is factually inaccurate. The language is inaccurate, the procedures (which the author spends a lot of time on) are alien to L.A. County Courts. It's very frustrating to work in the system every day, and have something portrayed as factually correct when it is so far out in left field it makes the rest of the read annoying."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Great read for a vacation or long plane trip. Have put this author on my list of great mystery writers. Kept your interest throughout."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Connelly is usually very good. His Bosch books are first-rate. This one starts with Connelly's usual flair and finesse, but falters, haltingly, after about one-third of the way. The plot becomes fairly predictable, and the \\"twists\\" are forced and strained, with the confluence of coincidences making \\"suspension of disbelief\\" unsustainable. Additionally, his courtroom stuff in this book, as in his others, is weak. (Connelly should stick with the police-procedurals at which he is so skilled.) If Connelly wanted his hero to be a skilled trial lawyer, they both fail. As for the prosecutors/antagonists, they are mere foils who would not find work in a small burg in the middle of nowhere, not to mention a mayor city like Los Angeles ... oops, what am I saying? I take that back. The O.J. Simpson trial showed that Connelly's bumbling Los Angeles prosecutors are mirrors of reality. OK, I've gone up one star for that. All in all, what started out very well done, petered out page-by-page. Sad."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I broke away from Grisham to see if Michael Connelly might offer something different in the justice/suspense adventure. Every move seemed obvious."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have not read this yet with other magazines and books to read but other micheal connely books have been good in the past.I have gotten behind on my reading because my mother got sick with cancer and passed away from it in 2010."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"So for starters -and this is not a SPOILER- the DA who goes against a shark in a courtroom is as green as grass and his boss wants him to win the case.Somewhere in the story you'll have a snitch, is he telling the truth?When you know who is the bad guy and what he did you don't have to read nothing about the trial because you'll know what's true and what's a whopper. This is the biggest mistake a writer can do - to show you the bad guy before the trial- and MC did.The other blunder MC did is that this book ends exactly the same way as the previous one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This review is for the audio version read by Adam Grupper. The plot is cleverly crafted and engaging, and Mr. Grupper does a great job. He pulls off multiple voices with believable changes in accents and intonations, and all are easy to understand and recognize. I highly recommend this version of the book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Fairly intense drama based on a defense lawyer's client who turned out to be a serial killer. He forces the Lincoln Lawyer to free him from the charges against him. Arm chair gripping to the end."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the second Haller story I have read by Michael Connelly and the Lincoln Lawyer was a rollicking good ride with some good suspense. Haller is a nicely developed character whom you get to know through his first person banter. Neither prosecutors or defense lawyers come across looking too good in Connelly's LA lawyer world. Connelly has definitely got a great style to his writing. Others have told you all about the story and I'll just add that it is well worth the read--great entertainment! I think my next Connelly book will be 9 Dragons. Connelly really can tell a story that reads quickly without getting too verbose or contrived. I have yet to read Connelly's backlist but I'll definitely read some of his earlier stuff."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"SynopsisAs a criminal defense lawyer, Mickey Haller has spent his entire professional life in the shadow of his legendary father, known for his brilliant defense of both famous and infamous mobsters and high-society icons. But all that was about to change, when Mickey is hired to defend a wealthy Los Angeles real estate magnate.Louis Roulet is Mickey's first \\"franchise client\\" - willing and able to pay any price for a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Throughout his career, Mickey has not been concerned with the guilt or innocence of his clients, only with presenting the evidence of the crime in a manner which would be in the best interest of whoever was paying the retainer. Manipulating the facts to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury was his stock in trade.For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence -- it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice.A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a \\"franchise\\" case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career.Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal -- this time to save his own life.My Two Cents WorthIt is difficult to believe that this is Connelly's first legal thriller. The courtroom action is as vivid and compelling as any Grisham I have read, and the action is well paced and true to life.As a reader, it is all you could ask for - a great story told by a consumate professional. It was fresh and original and kept me guessing until the last page. While it's not the most cureent Connelly novel, do yourself a favor and read The Lincoln Lawyer."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I am a huge fan of Michael Connely, ever since my days as an undergraduate, procrastinating with his other masterpiece (The Poet) in the middle of exam period (true story, I almost flunked BioChem-II!). Since, I had enjoyed every single one of his novels, some more than others, yet nothing managed to approach the crescendo intensity of his peak moment with the Poet. Until now that is.It is a story about lawyer, Mickey Haller. A ruthless yet likable defense attorney with his own short-range focus code of honor, trying to carve a living and escape the long shadow of his famous father. The father may have been dead ever since Mickey was five but when he was alive he rubbed elbows with the likes of Mickey Cohen and managed to dispense a lifetime supply of advice. And a wise warning: beware of the innocent client.Said lawyer keeps no brick & mortar office but operates out of four Lincoln Town cars he alternates, bought at discount fleet prices. Said lawyer has a daughter and two ex wives who, for some reason, still love him. Said lawyer will defend anyone for the right price but will hope for a franchise case, a complicated and protracted case of a rich client charged with something serious enough to pay him premium prices and keep him in style for a long time. But one should be careful what he wishes for.As if a malicious genie granting a wish, Mickey lands a rich client charged with sexual assault. When the client insists on his innocence (and wants to avoid the civil court implications of accepting a lesser charge) the trial is inevitable. And then his father warning comes back to bite him.I hate spoilers so I will stop here. But get ready for a roller-coaster of a ride, full of unexpected turns and fast ups and downs. To be honest I would have gone for a slightly different ending - yet the annoyance was minor and did not steal away any of the enjoyment.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a great suspense novel and a real page turner about criminal defense attorney Mickey who takes the case of Louis Roulet, who is charged with attempted murder, and rape. After taking the case Mickey soon discovers that Roulet (who is very wealthy) is not only a possible serial killer, but also someone who murdered a call girl whom one of his previous clients is in prison serving a life sentence for. At first, Mickey believes that Roulet is a dream client who can pay well for his services, but soon realizes that Roulet is a nightmare- someone who can put him in danger of being disbarred.I'm glad that I didn't pass this one up, because once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. I mean I read this every opportunity I got. That's just how well written, and suspenseful this novel is. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"one of the best authors out there right now, much more deserving of \\"best selling author\\" status than many others.The Lincoln Lawyer is not as thrilling as some of his others because much of it is courtroom drama, and that can tend to get boring. But still, it's a very good book.Connelly is a good author because his books are easy to read and the characters are likable and real. You care about the characters, because if you don't, then the book isn't interesting, it's just a series of events. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the protagonist in this story, it seems such a waste to write a one off book with such a well developed character.This is a must have for Michael Connelly fans, but his last book, the Closers might be a better one for those who have not read him before."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"In the Lincoln Lawyer, Michael Connelly introduces us to Mickey Haller, an LA attorney who will represent anyone as long as they can pay. Jaded by \\"the machine\\", he fails to recognize the innocence of one of his clients until it is too late. The appearance of another innocent client allows Mickey to finally redeem himself.Haller's daily lawyer routine and personal life are fascinating. Regarding the law, the author really appears to know what he is talking about. The first half of this book beats anything Grisham ever wrote. It is no surprise that a sequel has been written. However, I felt the story ended up being a bit bland. Some of Haller's actions in the latter half of the book didn't seem to be consistent with his character. Despite these flaws, this is a great character that we will hear more from."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Am I the only person in the world who had no idea what a \\"Lincoln\\" lawyer was until I read this book? I thought perhaps he lived in Nebraska or else had studied the great works of that famous president Abraham. What a surprise it was for me to find out that the word \\"Lincoln\\" had to do with the car in which this lawyer was chauffered around. Not only did he get driven around in this car, it was also his office. He handled his cases out of the backseat. I guess there's not a lot of overhead for these attorneys.It's great not only to read a good book but to also learn something along the way. I've never thought of Connelly as a teacher before but he taught me something new in The Lincoln Lawyer and kudos to him for doing so.In this book, we're introduced to a new character, Mickey Haller, attorney at law and attorney who has a fleet of Lincolns. There's no one better at character development than Michael Connelly and the reader is immediately drawn to Haller and, not only understands his way of working, but respects it as well. I just love it when an attorney has that moment in court where he's able to corner the witness -- it reminds me of having the best hand in poker and your opponent doesn't know it yet. This seems to be Haller's forte and Connelly gives Haller ample opportunity to show his wares and reward the reader with the outcome.This is Connelly's first foray into the defense side of the law. Fans of his Harry Bosch series are used to being on the prosecution side and credit Connelly with writing great police procedurals. This is the author's debut legal thriller and, with just one book, he has proven that he is now a master at both sides of the table.Another thing I learned from this novel is the importance of a \\"franchise\\" case. This is a case that will bring in so much money enabling the attorney to be working in the black.....and some. Thus is the case with Mickey's newest client Louis Roulet, a real estate agent but, more importantly, a rich \\"Momma's boy\\" . One of Haller's nightmares is that of having an innocent client and not being able to get him acquitted. Louis Roulet, accused of assault and rape, might just be that innocent client Mickey has dreamt about. But believe me when I say, Connelly will not allow it to be this easy. This book is masterfully intricate and the ending is the grand finale to these proceedings. If Mickey had nightmares before this case began, he clearly won't be getting any sleep when all is said and done.When I finished this book, I was excited to hear that there was a second Connelly book featuring Mickey Haller and picking up where we left off with The Lincoln Lawyer. That was great news to me. What was even better news was the fact that Harry Bosch would team up with Mickey Haller in this next book, The Brass Verdict. As I'm typing this, I'm one hundred pages into it and am just as satisfied as I was when I started The Lincoln Lawyer. There's nothing better than being enmeshed in a great book and I'm convinced that any book, with the name Michael Connelly on the cover, is going to be a winner. He's one author who has NEVER disappointed me. Ooops....I forgot about Chasing the Dime. Oh well, only disappointed once."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have to say this book was my favorite by Connelly. I would recommend it to anyone, whether u like books about lawyers or not. LL had me readin it til like 3 in the morning. Awesome characters and an awesome story. I'm waiting for The Brass Verdict to be in paperback so I can read another story with Mickey Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"By far the best I've read in a long, long time. Hope Michael Connelly decides to build this into another series. Definitely better than Harry Bosch. I want more Haller!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read many of Michael Connelly's novels, and aside from \\"The Poet,\\" \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" has been the most satisfying.Connelly is a fantastic writer, and the prose is always clear, concise and taut.This is somewhat of a departure for Connelly, getting away from the police procedural/ detective type of story and focusing on what comes after arrest--the trying of a criminal.The characters are vivid and elicit empathy, and the story is interesting and gripping throughout.What suprised me most was the courtroom scenes, which were as exciting as any scene in any of Connelly's other novels.In the end, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" comes highly recommended by this reviewer, and is hopefully not the last departure by Connelly in to the realm of legal thrillers."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The audio CDs added a new dimension to this incredibly written novel. It was an easy read, but the narration made it even more of a nail-biter."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Well written mystery with an interisting protagonist. A criminal lawyer who wil take any client who can afford him and beliefs his clients are all guilty. Not a real whodoneit more a how and why. Good airplane read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book was a page turner that kept my attention from start to finish. Few courtroom dramas give the reader such an intimate glimpse into a (defense) lawyer's witness-by-witness strategizing. Few thrillers keep the reader in such suspense until virtually the last page. These positives outweigh the mountain of implausibilities that allow the plot to proceed and, ultimately, to be wrapped up with such a bang. The protagonist, Mickey Haller, is a defense lawyer who has eschewed fancy digs in favor of a rotating fleet of Lincoln Continentals. He has a wonderful rapport with both of his ex-wives, one an ADA, the other his secretary/bookkeeper/conscience. He enjoys --- and exploits --- the enviable loyalty of his long list of miscreant clients (one of whom is paying his fee by serving as Mickey's driver). Mickey freely shares his many imperfections with the reader, but deep down, he has a core of nobility and bravery, even in the face of imminent danger --- or so we are to believe. A really good read if you don't over-analyze!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first Michael Connelly novel and I am just amazed. where have i been? cover to cover it was an amazing ride full of twists and turns. I really enjoyed reading it and highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a thriller full of drama, suspense and mystery."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is exactly what a legal thriller should be. There's a high stakes crime, court room scenes aplenty, and an engaging cast of heroes and villains to propel the story along through the various plot twists and predicaments that come along. This book takes the best parts of Richard North Patterson's books (the courtroom scenes), John Grisham's ealier yarns (the break neck pacing), and Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent (DA vs. PDefender politics) and combines them all into a rip-roaring read that'll have you turning pages long after you should be sleeping.Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I had heard good things about Michael Connelly before giving a try to one of his novel. I bought this one because the reviews were great and the main idea looked interesting and original. I was also curious about discovering this mystery writer. Well, it was worth every penny I spent on THIS AWESOME BOOK !The plot featured in the book is so well-paced, one of the most well-builded I have read. Usually, it takes me a few weeks to get throught this kind of novel. This one surprised me so much. It is so fascinating to read ! I was almost sad it was over after a few days. The main character, Michael Aller, is a fascinating, pretencious lawyer with a great evolution to discover along the story, and a few funny jokes to laught about along the chapters. The intrigue is great and with plenty of rebounds !I am definitly looking toward buying another of Connelly's book. He will certainly take a place in my TOP 3 favorite authors !"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"One thing that I have found in common with the books I enjoy most is that I relate well to one or more of the characters. Or that I like the character as a person.At times, Mickey Haller seems to represent what we all dislike about criminal defense lawyers. Slick, slimy, and about the money. Worst of all is they frequently see to it that criminals never serve any time in jail. Not ever studying the law, I don't have an appreciation for \\"the legal process\\". I want to see criminals behind bars. Mickey Haller finds holes in the District Attorney's cases and exploits them to get his clients free.Throughout the book though, we find that Mikey is more complex and has a likeable side. Michael Connelly seems to be the king of characters that I am never sure I really like or not. Both Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch have redeeming characteristics. They are smart, pragmatic, and persistent. But at the same time they are not the kind of guys I would just sit down with a beer and talk about the world.Nonetheless, I am convinced that I would want these guys on my side if the proverbial poo ever hit the fan.As a frequent visitor to Los Angeles (but never a resident), I also enjoy reading about LA and can relate to many places where scenes in the books take place and that I have also been.Lincoln Lawyer moves along at a brisk pace. If I am losing sleep to try and get a book finished, then it is a good book. There are some good twists and turns and the book keeps you on your toes. I like the Harry Bosch books and am waiting on the next one, but I hope that Connelly will bring back Mickey Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite author's, and this book does not disappoint. I love it!!!! For those of you who like legal thrillers, you won't be able to put this book down, it grabbed me from the first page. Connelly's character of lawyer Mickey Haller is colorful, witty, engaging, and has a street intelligence that doesn't quit. And the other characters are just as entertaining, especially some of his clients. If I (or any of you out there) ever need a criminal lawyer, this is the guy to look for. And, I think this would make an excellent movie - if they let Connelly have creative rights so the story stays the same. I can't wait for the next Micky Haller installment!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm always in the mood for a good legal thriller, and I had the pleasure of reading Michael Connelly's latest, The Lincoln Lawyer. An interesting story of right, wrong, and ethics...Mickey Haller is a defense attorney that is very good at what he does... giving his clients the legal defense they are granted by law. And while his clients are not really the cream of society, he takes pride in his services. He stumbles into a \\"franchise\\" case, one in which the money is large and the benefits will be long-term. He only has to prove that his rich client didn't savagely assault and nearly murder a prostitute. And initially, it looks like the client really *is* innocent. But the facts start to show that not only did he do it, but he's done it in the past. And a client that Haller forced a plea-bargain on many years ago may have been a victim of this same person. Haller has to start balancing his legal and ethical obligations to his client against what is truly \\"right\\". And one misstep may mean that he's on the hook for a murder he didn't commit, but that his client has him framed nicely for...This was really an excellent read. The good guys and bad guys are all just shades of gray, and often what's right isn't what's legal. The story paces nicely and accelerates towards the end, with a few twists that are just enough to keep you guessing as to the outcome of it all. While Connelly isn't an author I get on library wait lists for, I'm always entertained by his writing..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book was so well written and kept you guessing throughout. It was one of the best I have read this year. Michael Connelly knows what being a defense lawyer is all about. His observations of the court system made this a book come to life."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"All the usual hallmarks of Connelly's work are here; interesting characters, excellent dialogue, strong sense of place, and a fast-moving, gripping plot. Add to that an interesting look at the defense side of the legal system and you have a very good legal thriller. I particularly enjoyed the character of Mickey; he's not as dark as some, but he believes in what he does and is growing as a person. I love an author on whose work you can rely, and Connelly certainly is that."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Taking over for the usual Harry Bosch character, Mickey Haller handles the starring role perfectly in The Lincoln Lawyer.Connelly captures the big-time defense lawyer perfectly, from his ruthless collection of fees to his absorption in his work. Haller may not be a warm, fuzzy or even righteous man, but he's never dull. Especially when his newest jackpot client, a young and wealthy real estate broker, hires him to fight assault charges.It's not easy to love a defense lawyer, and Haller is no exception. Connelly does a fine job in creating a story where the main character is fascinating, and the reader is pulling for him, even if he is flawed. Reader ambivalence doesn't always help a story, but in this case it really keeps things humming.This is an exciting book, with an exciting character. Mickey Haller could support many other mysteries, and it should be fun to see if he appears in more books to come."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"If you love John Grisham's brand of lawyering, you will go nuts with this one.It's funny, touching and sad. It has fast paced courtroom drama and a wild suprise at the end, which we all should have seen coming. (Because it's so well done, it's a plesant surprise.)Some things were left a little unclear, but in all it was great fun.The characters were believable and they changed.. they actually learned from mistakes and successes. The protagonist went through a painful rebirth and guess what? Not everything turned out to be perfect. Our man was left with disappointments and regrets. I like that sort of thing -- real life mixed with improbable fiction.It was like a hybrid of Carl Hiassen and John Grisham but ramped up to a \\"literary\\" take on some ugly characters and situations. I loved the honesty and vulnerability of the tough old, \\"seen-it-all\\" lawyer.Great book.MM"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm not a literature snob, but I thought the characters in this book are flat and that the plot was not very exciting or suspenseful."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The desire for me to read Michael Connelly has been for quite some time. Just one of those things where I wanted to simply wait for the right title to come along and catch my attention. It seems that \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" caught a lot of attention, and for good reason. I didn't know what to expect. Would it be choppy? Perhaps sloppy? Would I want to read Connelly again? Nothing at all sloppy in this, just some darn great writing! Don't take my word for it, pick it up and determine for yourself. Hey, maybe I personally think that a car such as a Lincoln is one of the ugliest suckers on the block. I do. I think that a Lincoln car is U-G-L-Y! I'm an import man. But then again, maybe an author such as Michael Connelly can make this look somewhat handsome. I'm glad I took my chances.I just said that I think Lincoln cars are ugly. In this book, that isn't the only thing. It GETS ugly! Hey, Mickey Haller is a darn good defense attorney. His tricks up his sleeve are worth the price he charges. You might even say he's somewhat of a hustler for the common criminal. Now he takes the case of a real estate boy, a man named Louis Roulet (pronounced Roo-Lay, by the way) who wants to be cleared of a despicable crime! You stick with Haller and eavesdrop on a few conversations with Roulet, you might see some deception going on. And whatever you do, don't mess with Louis's mommy! Mommy says he's innocent, then you believe her, right? Tee-hee!You can smell the foul play in this! You know there is innocence, but where? What do you do? How to you know where to turn when all that is offered are sharp twists? A lot of good twists, I might add. Take that, add a couple of ex-wives, and even add Fernando Valenzuela (yeah, the bondsman, not the baseball pitching star!) to the equation, and see if you can figure this out! I bet it just might have you hooked.Hey, I can't stand Lincolns, but I liked this. I guess that gives me a reason to check out Michael Connelly in the future. I'll be on the look out!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a Los Angeles defense attorney whose client list runs the gamut of typical low-life lawbreakers. Suddenly he acquires what he defines as a \\"franchise\\" case...a client who can afford to pay big bucks for a defense. Complications soon arise and Haller finds himself in dire straits. I am not a big fan of lawyer stories, but I have enjoyed all of Connelly's previous detective novels so on the basis of the Connelly name, I decided to give this one a try. Mickey Haller is an interesting character. He is not a saint, but tries to do the right thing when faced with the intricacies of the law. The pace moves along at a good clip and the twists and turns held my interest throughout. I still prefer the Harry Bosch books, but this one made for a nice change of pace."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This guy is one of the most consistently well-written authors in the business.

I devour them the minute they are released."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm not going to reveal the story line or tell you the ending but I am going to tell you this is a book you should get.

Happy reading kids"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw the movie first and that movie started me reading all of Michael Connelly's books in order of their published dates. I am now in 2009 published books and love the way Mr. Connelly connects the characters from other books or mentions other crimes from other books to bring everything into sight and perspective."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The title really made me think it was going to be about a layer like President Lincoln was -- I was surprised but it is as always a good Connelly read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I checked out this movie from my local library. The film is 119 minutes, and the director is Brad Furman--super job!Although I'm not a Matthew McConaughey fan, I truely enjoyed this movie. It had my heart jumping at almost every scene. The climaxes were suprising and shocking.I don't want to give away the climaxes, plots, nor the story line, but the title cleaverly refers to his Lincoln Continental. This emphasis is placed on the car because he is an extremely troubling character who drinks heavily.He's a very financially successful criminal trial lawyer who has lost his morality because he defends shady defendents, criminals, and gang members. He has lost his drivers license and has a very colorful driver who has access to both the legitimate world and the criminal world.In an unorthodox fashion, he conducts business deals from his Lincoln because he only wants to meet these shady characters on his own terms. He is known for his winning looks and immoral manner. His ex-wife still adores him, but his drinking tears their marriage apart.Merisa Tomei plays a terrific supporting role as his stable, understanding, and accepting ex-wife. You immediately hate this guy and the scum he defends, but then you begin to warm to him as he remembers why his went into law in the first place.The plot is full of surprises you don't see coming. The character is well developed, and the supporting actors give very strong and convincing performances. This is a winner with a little eye candy for the ladies. Although he's a drunk, he always looks pulled together."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the first Michael Connelly book that I have read. I picked this up on the recommendation of Lee Child from a recent interview where he laid out the writers he liked and the ones that he didn't. After reading this book, I can see why he put Connelly in the favorite category.For what it is worth, this book was very tightly written. The dialogue was very good. There were no hidden tricks pulled on the reader, meaning, you could have definitely figured out the mystery from all of the clues given.To me, everything came across as plausible. Which is always a big question in these kinds of books.Despite being a somewhat densely written book, for a mystery, the book moved very quickly."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every page. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a thrill ride in the mind of trial lawyer or crime thriller period."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"But loved the book.

If you haven't seen the movie, don't read the book first."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read this before I even knew it was going to become a movie. I loved the story and loved the reality of the main characters. The story was one that kept you stopping the read because you wanted to see what was going to happen next. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Connelly shows us the slimy underside of the US legal system (to put it mildly). Given the rampant corruption inherent in any system where rules, by-laws and procedural regulations run rampant. This analogy becomes clear early on, when Haller likens the justice system to a machine, with his job to find the cracks (i.e. get his clients acquitted on technicalities or anything else at his disposal). And he is incredibly skilled at what he does. Despite having over a decade of experience in the courtroom, however, there are certain \\"icebergs\\" he cannot evade when the evidence is too overwhelming. Although his goal is invariably to attain the best outcome for his clients, the consequences run deeper than he initially thought. Fear creeps in as we learn more about his past and his broken marriage (which led to a convenient conflict of interest between Mickey and Maggie McFierce). Connelly has done a profoundly successful job making his characters believable, complex and interesting. There is little repetition, and the flashbacks and expositions are always pertinent to the greater picture.While many of Connelly's novels feature blurring lines of right and wrong, The Lincoln Lawyer begins with a simple and unequivocal axiom (no client is as scary as an innocent man). The novel shows how easy it can be to become jaded and disillusioned with humanity, even when having such an almost upbeat edict as your guiding principle.The writing is always sharp, frequently witty, never dull and occasionally sprinkled with f-bombs. This last quality does not detract from the experience (except possibly for extreme prudes), and the investigation scenes are often as gripping and tense as the vicious back-and-forths that occur in the courtroom.I did find the \\"big expose\\" at the end to be a little too obvious, however, and it was hard to see how Haller couldn't put it together. That's a minor quibble in the big picture, though, and I highly recommend this novel. This got me hooked and I finished the other three Haller books in a few weeks."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Kept me entertained. I enjoy Michael Connely's books.

Even though Haller did not know his father, he ultimately ended up following in his old man's footsteps by becoming a defense attorney.Here is a joke for you: What is the difference between a catfish and a lawyer? One is a bottom feeding shit sucker while the other is a fish.Michael Connelly tells the story of law as though he had been a practicing lawyer all his life and with an authenticity and creativity that actually kind of makes you want to go back to school and try your hand at law. The one thing that would stop me from becoming a lawyer however is the same that thing Haller was afraid of for his entire career, having an innocent man come to him for defense and he not be able to see it. Which is what ends up happening and now Haller must find a way to get the innocent man out of prison and find a way to put the newest client, an evil son-of-a-bitch behind bars for the rest of his life."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"one of the best authors out there right now, much more deserving of \\"best selling author\\" status than many others.The Licoln Lawyer is not as thrilling as some of his others because much of it is courtroom drama, and that can tend to get boring. But still, it's a very good book.Connelly is a good author because his books are easy to read and the characters are likeable and real. You care about the characters, because if you don't, then the book isn't interesting, it's just a series of events. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the protagonist in this story, it seems such a waste to write a one off book with such a well developed character.This is a must have for Michael Connolley fans, but his last book, the Closers might be a better one for those who have not read him before."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first Michael Connelly novel - am ready to jump into more! The characters were very well developed and I like that Connelly keeps it simple by not introducing too many details about \\"non-essential\\" characters.Working in criminal defense for 10 yrs and being married to a defense attorney for 15, I can say that Michael Connelly's THE LINCOLN LAWYER is very accurate and actually quite good. I liked that it is written in 1st person. Of course, a real-life lawyer would have handled the ethical conflict of the situation differently, but not much a story there!One thing that did purturb me was the use of all the analogies to describe either attorneys or the criminal justice system itself, i.e., spinning plates, razor, slingshots, etc...... that got to be a little trite. But, overall a very good novel and a recommended read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I LOVED the Lincoln Lawyer, probably because I know a lot of defense attorneys and work in a local District Attorney's Office. Everything was clearly written and believable. The personal issues of the characters in the novel were also REAL and believable.Mickey is the typical defense attorney (marital issues, money issues, issues in general)who doesn't really want to know if the client is guilty or innocent, because long ago he became jaded and did not think he could recognize innocence when he saw it. Hint...an old client tells him of his innocence and he did not believe him and this is crucial later in the story. The story is cleverly written (600 pages which felt like only 100)and moves at a fast pace. I don't think the mystery in itself was complicated, I could figure out who the real culprit was, but the writing style and plot was what made the book so enjoyable. If you are remotely interested in the Criminal Justice System, you will love to see how it really works behind the scenes. The good and the bad. Read this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Criminal defense lawyer Mickey Haller works out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car, driven by a client in exchange for his fee. One ex-wife books Haller's clients for him while his other ex-wife is a prosecuting attorney. When a bondsman recommends Haller to Louis Ross Roulet, a man accused of assaulting a prostitute, Haller is eager for the job. Roulet is what Haller thinks of as a franchise: a rich man whose defense will result in high fees. But Haller's investigation into the charges against Roulet lead him back to a former client, Jesus Menendez. Even though Menendez swore he was innocent, Haller convinced him to plead guilty and deal on a murder charge. As Haller's investigation deepens, he begins to think the one thing he has always feared has come to pass: that he helped put an innocent man in prison. And now, the real killer is playing games with Haller's life.Michael Connelly has written an exceptional thriller here. Tight writing, a slithering plot, and filled with suspense. The reader will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I believe I read that Michael Connelly has been nominated for an Edgar with this book. If not, he should be.

This is by far my favorite of all his books, and that is saying a lot because I have loved each and every one of them ... I hope we see Mickey again -- he is an awesome character with his own little set of unmatched \\"baggage\\" that endears you to him from the moment you read about him spending most of the winter eating mixed nuts out of a tupperware bowl ... The story is brilliant - fresh, crisp and beautifully detailed and layered, perfectly crafted by a master storyteller. Congrats, Michael, this one is awesome!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As much as I love Michael Connelly, and I have read and loved him from the first, it was with some trepidation that I picked up his latest non-Bosch effort. I need not have worried. LINCOLN LAWYER is not only a great stand alone effort but I hope it launches a new series. Connelly's anti-hero is the most unlikely \\"sympathetic\\" character I've met in some time. What a ride. Damon Runyan would be proud."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Good book - fast paced and keeps your interest to the end. The reader is excellent, changing his voice for each person so that you feel involved in the storyline. Only complaint I had was they end and start each CD with music which almost blocks out the speaker's voice."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have read every one of Michael Connelly's books and, unlike Grisham and Cornwell, he just keeps getting better. The main character, Micky Haller, is an LA defense attorney whose greatest fear is that he won't recognize innocence if he sees it. He doesn't ask if his clients are innocent or guilty and he doesn't care. It's \\"The Deal\\" that excites him. He finally gets a \\"franchise client\\" who insists he is innocent of a brutal beating and attempted rape and murder. The story takes enough twists and turns with enough surprises to keep the reader intrigued. Michael Connelly is a master of character development. He can actually make sleazy characters likable. This is an excellent read for anyone who likes a good murder mystery. Be prepared to stay up late."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"What I have found in this novel is a blend of a deep knowledge of the subject, (the application of Criminal Law and police procedural) and a brilliant and poignant easy fast writing style plenty of colorful quick dialogues and images that makes this book a lighting bolt from the front to back covers.The above features are skills the author acquired step by step from his past experiences creating his Harry Bosch seriesThe central character, Michael Haller, a criminal defense attorney who uses as office his cell phone and the back seat of his Lincoln car, has many dimensions and seems to pop out of the pages, a very funny heroeIt is interesting to know that the author know the ropes around the legal system, the cops and the gang world and what it is noteworthy is that the Lincoln Lawyer plays his cards employing his wide knowledge not of the Law but of the \\"tricks of the trade\\", and also makes bright spicy observations every step of the way (for the reader) about how you have to deal to accomplish your goals (get a non-guilty verdict for what you well know is your client guilty.)The ending brightly conceived crowns this excellent read and does not disappoint in any way"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This review was used to review th efilm version of The Lincoln Lawyer as well.Yes, I know, everybody, everybody including Richard III, I think, who uttered some variation of that idea in William Shakespeare's play of the same name, hates lawyers. Hates them until old justice time comes along and everyone, including this writer, hopes to high heaven that their lawyer is up to the task of representing them zealously, and in some desperate cases more than zealously. And that combination of sentiments, that hate/love thing, is what drives this film which according to my usually reliable sources follows the Michael Connelly novel pretty closely.Needless to say, except for the thugs, pimps, dope dealers, hellish motorcycle angels, bail bondmen, public servant grifters and grafters and a bewitching lawyer ex-wife (played by Marissa Tormei) nobody, no viewer anyway, is suppose to like the Lincoln lawyer at the outset. (Named the Lincoln lawyer, by the way, not for his ethical resemblance to Father Abraham but because he rides around in a chauffeur-driven Lincoln.) His wheeling and dealing just this side of the law is what makes him the darling of that rogue's gallery of characters listed above (except, of course, the fetching ex-wife, and maybe her a little too) and the bane of the District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles Police Department establishment.That deft and ruthless maneuvering is what also draws him to the attention of a vicious killer of women, women of the night to use a quaint phrase, and a surefire way to commit the \\"perfect murder\\" and like so many before him said murderer thought he was scot-free as is the usual case once the Lincoln lawyer was on the case. But see, said Lincoln lawyer \\"got religion\\" along the way after he and those around him were slated to take the fall if that vicious killer (a mommy's boy to boot) got tripped up.So you know damn well pretty early on that our trusty Lincoln lawyer is not taking the fall and, moreover, is going to see that an actual piece of real justice occurs in the process by the freeing a framed man who was sitting in stir through his negligence (and disbelief in innocence) by seeing that that vicious killer gets his jolt up at Q. Therefore you see we had it all wrong. There is some rough justice in the world. And one had better not kill off all those lawyers if there is going to be even that amount. The twists and turns getting there, although fairly well-worn by now in movie-dom, are what make this film one to see."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"M. Connally enters this world of L.A. court house law with an interesting character who buys three Lincoln Town Cars just to get the Fleet Rate. Good investment when he dodges a loose killer who traces this lawyer's every step; like a walnut shell game in L.A.'s MacArthur Park on a sunny April day .... irresistable!Plenty of excitement, some great looking, cosmopolitan women, the work-a-day underside of West L.A. and the hustle of Southern California is captured in each chapter.

And when I am done with my 5.99 paperback I can give it to a friend to read. Why do we pay more for digital books when it is far less expensive to produce a digital book than a printed book? The author......and the book are excellent. I cannot give the 5 star review out of principal, why are we paying so much for kindle editions?"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a well written parable of greed and conceit, basically everything we expect of lawyers. Mr. Connelly fills his book with every rationale and every deceit the lawyers in LA live for and with every day. I liked the book even though I hated the character, despite his obvious intelligence he can't seem to get out of his own way. And as the book stumbles to it's inevitable conclusion wherein the hero brings the villain to \\"justice\\" he does so with little grace and wit.

The story isn't bad but the writing style is mediocre at best."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer appears to be the first in a new series - or at least a recurring character - for this author, of whom I am a big fan. The new protagonist, Mickey Haller, is a criminal defense lawyer that in many ways fits the sleazy stereotype - the guilt or innocence of his client is irrelevant as long as he or she can pay Mickey's fee. Haller works either in the court-room or from his Lincoln Town Car because time is money.Mickey has sources and schemes working all over town to draw in clients and he is always on the look-out for the franchise client; one who is able and willing to pay whatever his defense will cost. Mickey is twice divorced - but yet both of his \\"exes\\" still like him and in fact one works for him. Haller is also the very absent father of a darling daughter - who misses her Daddy.Early on in the book Haller lands a \\"franchise client\\" with deep pockets and a slam dunk case. The plot thickens though as this current case ties into Mickey's past. He soon begins to question his current client's innocence, while second guessing his defense of a previous client - which he may have mishandled - who is now serving a life sentence without parole for a crime - it now dawns on Mickey, he may not have committed.Haller is not accustomed to such self-reflection, let alone caring about his clients' culpability - but with each twist and turn Mickey's franchise client - even with all his money - becomes a bargain with the devil.Sounds simple - or at least predictable - but in this author's hands that's just the beginning.As Connelly's books are character driven - with such complex protagonists as Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb - Haller as the sleazy lawyer, i.e. a predictable character, could prove to be a handicap. Even in this first book, the reader can feel the tug of war going on within the writing, whether to portray Mickey as a rascal or scoundrel - a fine line but a distinct one. We readers will have to wait and see what Connelly decides. That being said, The Lincoln Lawyer is still a very good book and I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is the best, and this new direction will hopefully going to continue. Good Read!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"You will not be able to wait to turn the next page in this humorous legal mystery. Brilliantly written, surprises galore, and a poignant look at a wanna be big time crimminal defense lawyer at work. He believes he has a \\"franchise\\" rich client accused of rape and murder, but gets much more than he bargained for. A great insight into the games and cheating of prosecutors to gain a conviction, and \\"scum sucking\\" defense lawyers milking their clients dry."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer was everything I wanted for a fast-paced, gripping, action-packed novel. Connelly does everything right in this book all the way through...kept me up til 2am trying to finish it. It is smartly written but not too complex to be confusing. Go for it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first Michael Connelly book and it certainly won't be my last. I get easily frustrated with legal thrillers. But this book is, to me, near-perfect. In addition to capturing many realistic and horrifying aspects of the criminal justice system, it also has maybe one of the best, most intricate, and most clever \\"legal thriller\\" plots I have ever read. Holy cow, this man can plot. The twists and turns are amazing, and none of them were in the least bit predictable, yet all of them held up, and were more fantastic than any of the guesses you might have been making about where the book would go as you were reading. I don't know about you but that's my favorite kind of mystery.In this book, there are a few technical problems. For example: it's hard to buy that a great defense attorney would ever turn over a fantastic piece of exculpatory video evidence to the prosecutor the way Mickey does early on in this book. Any defense attorney half as good as Mickey would know that a prosecutor like the one he is going up against (who we are told time and time again is extremely ruthless) would not recieve a piece of evidence like that and say, \\"Oh, wow, you're right. This tape shows your man is innocent! I'm dismissing this case immediately and please accept my personal apologies.\\" No, that prosecutor would use the tape to his own advantage at trial, so turning it over that far in advance would be a terrible idea. I think a good lawyer (as well as most readers!) would know this. There are a few other things like that in the book were a little unrealistic for a smart defense lawyer to do. However, a reader can forgive them, because most of them are just a necessity to a great plot and the way it needs to go.Despite a few of these plot \\"cheats\\" Connelly has clearly done his research and he captures this lawyer brilliantly. Overall, this is one of the most accurate (if dramatic) portrayals of certain aspects of the criminal justice system that I've seen in awhile.One thing I wanted to add - in response to readers who said that they didn't like the protagonist here as much as other characters they've read - my answer is, I don't think you are supposed to completely like this main character in that way. Mickey is clearly, in many ways, an ethically challenged, flawed guy. He tells you so himself. But I think the genius of Connelly's work here is that he makes you like and respect and root for Mickey in spite of (or maybe because of!) those flaws. Anyone can make a John Grishamesque, ethically heroic lawyer likeable - but I think a guy who can make you like someone like Mickey the way Connelly does has got to be a darn fine writer. (and, for me, the reading experience had more depth and the character was more interesting to explore because of it.)So - genius plotting, great characterizations and psychological portraits, and truly a thrill to read. This is the best legal thriller I've read all year and might rank in my top five ever. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Thank you for an excellent read Michael....I enjoyed your characters and their flaws. Your book kept me up nights..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book rocks. I don't need to recap the plot as everyone else has done a bang up job.This was my first Michael Connely book and I am a believer. One of the slickest suspense novels I have read in a very long time.Long live Micky Haller!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thought this was a great twisted plot and how would a lawyer feel if he were in this position. It is one of the better books I've read in a while"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is the 2nd Michael Connolly book I've read in a month. He has quickly gone to the top of my list of thriller writers. This is a courtroom drama (I'm told it's his first) and it holds you until the last page.Mickey Haller is a defense lawyer without an office, working out of the backseat of his Lincoln (thus the book's name). He has 2 ex-wives, a daughter, and a collection of low life , scumbag clients. Haller lands a \\"franchise\\" case (a big money client) that will test his legal deftness and his moral courage.This book is everything a legal thriller should be - a fast paced drama with colorful, well drawn characters that keeps you turning pages long after you should have gone to bed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I really enjoyed this legal thriller that I found more enjoyable and a lot more believable than some of the top Grisham novels! Michael (Mickey) Haller is a lawyer who is used to wraggling with the legal system to catch breaks for obviously guilty people. He persues this line of work because his biggest fear is that one day he will be faced with having to defend a truly \\"innocent\\" person. The reason for the fear is that if he ever lost the case then he will have to live with the fact that he let an innocent man go to prison.Mickey comes into a case just like that and takes the case because it offers him possibly the biggest payday of his career. What he finds is that everything is not what it seems and he may have already have been guilty of letting an innocent man go to prison.With tension that you can cut a knife with up to the very last page, Connelly has done a masterful job. Even the ending is not what you expect and Connelly does not cop out as many other writers of successful thrillers have!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"A defense attorney, Mickey Haller, is born into the business, as it were, as a son of a famous lawyer who finds himself defending a wealthy individual who will pay what it takes to be properly defended since he is innocent, or so he proclaims in a manner similar to Haller's other clients. And the wealth perhaps colors the perception by Haller.And during preparing for the trial, Haller begins to see different things and begins to question things and what may be going on. The twists and turns begin fairly early on in the book, and it is no secret in general what is going to potentially happen. Who is innocent. Who is guilty. What are the choices to be made. All of it is fairly standard legal thriller book type scenarios. But this book is more. Though seemingly in the usual mold, Connelly is able to make the twists and turns take you along the way with enough things that you will probably not see coming... or at least not everytime.The writing is well done and tight - there really is not many lines that are in here that are filler or do not keep moving the story along. It is no secret how good Connelly is, and here he takes it into the world of the legal thriller which he does just as well as he always does."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"11 hours, 37 minutes10 CDsRead by Adam GrupperMichael Connelly leaves Harry Bosch behind for a while to introduce a new character - defense attorney Mickey Haller. Haller plays all of the angles all of the time. He knows all of the ins and outs of the L.A. court system and knows all of the ways to create revenue for his practice - he needs every penny because he has two ex-wives and a child to support. Haller saves money by using his car, a roomy Lincoln, as his office. His driver is a client who is working off what he owes to Haller.Haller is asked to defend a very rich Beverly Hills playboy in an attempted rape/murder case and soon Haller's world starts to become even more complicated. Ethical considerations, murder, love of family and the desire for justice for a man unfairly imprisoned all get tangled together.The audiobook is wonderfully read by veteran narrator Adam Grupper. He does a fantastic job of giving each character a distinctive voice and the conversations flow as easily as if they were read by a team of actors.The book is a solid legal thriller - I stayed interested until the end and looked forwards to hearing more during my morning and evening commutes."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I got the idea to read this from Nicholson Baker's article against Amazon's Kindle device where he said he had to finish reading this on his Kindle (despite disliking doing so on such a shoddy device) because he had to know what happened in the end. I'm not predisposed toward legal/crime thrillers as I think they're a bit too melodramatic and sensationalist (I was thinking of John Grisham). However it's an unfair generalisation as I hadn't read any books from this genre. So I picked it up not expecting much, probably giving up after the court room scene where the lawyer does a Pacino and spouts on to the jury about how the system is corrupt, etc. Yawn, snooze.What can I say? Pleasantly surprised? No, in fact utterly gobsmacked! What had I been missing! Who was this writer?! Michael Connelly... the name was one of those you see in charity shelves alongside James Patterson and Andy McNab, an ubiquitous author, bound to be overpraised. I'd say \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the best novel I've read in a year.I can't complain about any aspect of the book - the characters were solid, the main character utterly likeable, believable and real, the plot compelling, the dialogue and descriptions, right down to the legal speak seemed authoritative and right (I'm not a lawyer so I can only say it sounded like he'd done his research). The whole setup of a lawyer in a lincoln town car, the pro with years of experience dealing with judges and bikers with complete confidence, was new to me and rich in story. Even Nicholson Baker's claim that he read the last hundred pages at a gallop in one sitting turned out true - actually for me it was more like the last 150 pages in one enjoyable sunny Sunday afternoon.I cannot recommend this book more. I'm not one for legal thrillers but this was a fantastic novel. I'm already deep into the sequel \\"The Brass Verdict\\" and have ordered Connelly's latest \\"The Scarecrow\\". I urge you to check this guy out, the man knows how to write."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"There is enough plot and intrigue in this entertaining thriller that it could have filled three books. After 25 years as a trial lawyer I kept trying to figure out where our hero was going. There were just enough hints to keep things moving along briskly, but not enough to get there first. If you are still on the fence about buying this one, just get over it and go for it!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I started reading Michael Connelly's work in chronological order 4 months ago. Connelly almost always carries characters, places, events, etc. from earlier books to latter ones. So, I was very surprised when I read Lincoln Lawyer and there was no cross over whatsoever. I really missed the linkages to earlier works. I hadn't realized how much the cross over adds to the story.Connelly most often writes from the perspective of a law enforcement officer. This is his first work where an attorney is the main character. Michael Haller is a defense attorney working the system and just getting by. As you get to know Haller, you learn he is twice divorced, doesn't see much of his daughter, the clients he represents are generally guilty, and he is a master manipulator of the system. Haller is hired by a wealthy man accused of beating a prostitute and threatening to rape and kill her. This client turns out to be unlike any client Haller has ever represented. As the plot twisted and turned, it reminded me a lot of early John Grisham books.Definitely a different type of work for Connelly. I understand they are making a movie out of Lincoln Lawyer and it should be a good one just like the book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Even though I have since come to understand what a gifted author Michael Connelly is, I was not familiar with his name when I started reading his novels a few months ago. Since then, I have come to understand that I am familiar with his work, in such movies as Blood Work (Clint Eastwood) and others. I just didn't connect with Mr. Connelly's name at that time. I have corrected this oversight. Michael Connelly is sort of like a hard core John Grisham. I personally have enjoyed Michael Connely's Lincoln Lawyer novels the most, as they strike that combination of interest, drama, suspense and cathartic resolution that appeals to the Grisham side of brain. I find it hard to believe that these have not yet become movies, with someone like Harrison Ford as the lead.Although I have not previously been interested in \\"cop novels\\", I did also read Connely's \\"The Closers\\" and am in the middle of his \\"The Poet,\\" both of which are in that vein. Connelly is an outstanding author and has that unique gift of being able to intellectually craft the tone and unique approach that he wants for each of his novels, then follow through with that tone through the entire book. He is a true writer's writer; he has obviously been at this a long time and is a highly skilled storyteller. Unlike many authors who fall into a lazy path of the same thing time after time, Connelly seems to always be fresh with each of his novels, trus to the characters he so successfully and naturally develops, allowing the reader to understand what makes the characters tick by Showing you, rather than telling you. Connelly has swiftly become one of my top 10 favorite authors. This guy can write and does it better than most of the novelists on the planet.[...]"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Lincoln Lawyer was my first Michael Connelly book & it won't be my last. Michael Haller is a defense attorney who is chauffeured around in a Lincoln. He gets himself into an unusual predicament, but he's a pro & doesn't easily get outsmarted. The book was quite suspenseful & it kept me wondering WHAT would happen next and HOW would Mickey get out of his \\"situation\\".........

One we can like and root for even though he freely admits to getting some of the most despicable criminals imaginable off scott free. You get the feeling Mickey is seeking redemption of some sort beyond just the wrongful imprisonment of a past client and is striving to do the right thing. The relationships between him and his clients, his friends and especially his ex-wives is well defined and a large part of the enjoyment of this book.A great plot, with likable characters, excellent writing and twists right up till the end make this quite possibly Connelly's best book yet."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I overdosed on legal thrillers years ago, when John Grisham and Scott Turow were at the very top of their game. Although the plots were still complex and dazzling, I'd begun to feel claustrophobic for some reason, and I stopped reading them. I needed to get out of the courtroom.If there's one author whom I can't ignore, it's Michael Connelly. When The Lincoln Lawyer came out, I couldn't believe it. One of my favorite authors had written a legal thriller! I studiously ignored the book until The Brass Verdict appeared. Once I realized that Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer himself, was going to be appearing with my beloved Harry Bosch, I knew I'd have to bite the bullet and read up on what makes Mickey Haller tick.I should've bitten that bullet a long time ago.Defense attorney Mickey Haller does a lot of his business from the back of his Lincoln. In fact, he has a whole fleet of the automobiles. By the time I met Mickey, he had all the appearance of a completely jaded legal hack:\\"I didn't deal in guilt and innocence, because everybody was guilty. Of something. But it didn't matter, because every case I took on was a house built on a foundation poured by overworked and underpaid laborers. They cut corners. They made mistakes. And then they painted over the mistakes with lies. My job was to peel away the paint and find the cracks. To work my fingers and tools into those cracks and widen them. To make them so big that either the house fell down or, failing that, my client slipped through.\\"For all his world-weary talk of everyone being guilty of something, Haller is also pointing the finger at himself. He feels that he didn't do everything possible when he defended Jesus Menendez, who's now looking life without parole straight in the eyes from the \\"comfort\\" of San Quentin. Regardless of how he may be perceived outwardly, Haller is a good guy who remains on very good terms with both ex-wives, and who secretly longs to be presented with a truly innocent man to defend. (He worries that, after all this time, he won't be able to recognize innocence when he sees it.)Then Louis Roulet is charged with assault and attempted murder. This is what Haller calls a \\"franchise case\\" because Roulet's mother will pay any amount of money to see her son declared innocent. But the more Haller and his investigator Raul Levin work on this case, the more things don't add up. Haller finds himself caught in a deadly web, and it's going to take every speck of his smarts to work his way out of it intact.Connelly worked his magic on me once again. Within a few pages, I was fascinated with the character of Mickey Haller. For all his quiet, matter-of-fact posturing and pronouncements, he still retains a remarkable degree of gullibility. The pacing is perfect throughout the book, gathering speed with each successive chapter. When Haller realizes the trap he's fallen into, the plan he puts together to extricate himself is brilliant and almost guaranteed to keep readers glued to the page.Since I had such a great reading experience with Lawyer Haller, am I going to add legal thrillers to my reading diet once more? No, but I certainly am ready for The Brass Verdict!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read the Bras Verdict which I liked very much so I got a copy of the Lincoln Lawyer. Would have to say this is one of the best books out there. Loved the characters and the true depiction of behind the scenes court room law. This book keeps your interest throughout and just becomes unable to put down after the first half. I am now a Connelly fan and am starting the Narrows today.Hope he continues this series with Mitch Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This book got me hooked on Michael Connelly. I can't stand books that have two chapters devoted to someones thoughts while they're doing dishes; Connelly doesn't either. His books are straight-forward in-your-face action. The Bosch series is more interesting, but this one is sweet."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly's books are fun to read. He's the king of misdirection and gets the story's pace just right. i hadn't enjoyed a book like this in such a long time! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly has a way of making the beginning of his novels mundane, and somewhat boring on the action front, yet still very interesting. Then the mundane plot begins to pick up, the irrelevant becomes relevant, and by then, you are totally hooked. THE LINCOLN LAWYER was released in 2005 and features a new character, Mickey Haller. This is great book. Haller is a great character, full of contradictions. He is a good, decent man who represents some of the worst criminals in society. He has two ex-wives but they both still like him and one even works for him. And is biggest fear is not being able to recognize innocence in a client.Mickey rides around in the back of a Lincoln Town Car, juggling clients, always trying to find ones that will meet the most important criterea. They have money to pay him. Mickey thinks he has found the dream client in Louis Roulet. Louis is a 30 year old real estate agent that comes from a family of money. He's been accused of beating a woman. Roulet claims the woman was beaten before he arrived at her house in an attempt to set him up for a big civil settlement. Haller takes the case and the first order of business is to get paid. Once this happens, Haller dives into the details, and the story takes off.The characters in the novel, and the dilemmas they face, are what make THE LINCOLN LAWYER a great novel. Mickey Haller is a great character, one who is tormented by the possibility of having an innocent client go to jail. When he discovers that Louis Roulet might not be the person he says he is, Haller must fight to save his career, his family and his life. Connelly also creates many solid supporting characters including Fernando Venenzuala, the bail bondsman, Maggie \\"McFierce\\", the assistant DA and Haller's ex-wife, and Raul Levin, Haller's private investigator.The plot of the novel is what had me up at night unable to put the book down. The plot is also the ultimate weekness in the book. About halfway through the novel, Connelly reveals the big \\"twist\\" that the plot is built upon. The rest of the novel, while compelling and full of twists and turns, is ultimately just about how the big plot twist plays out.This novel reminded me about how much I enjoy Michael Connelly and that I need to make it a priority to read every novel he has written. If you are a fan, or looking for a great writer, then check out this book. And hurry, because Haller returns in the fall in a sequel that also features Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is a defense attorney that uses his Lincoln Town car as his mobile office. His Chauffeur is a former client who is working off his legal bill, one of Haller's ex-wives is a top-notch prosecuter and the other ex-wife is his office manager. Wow, all that is a basis for an interesting story, but it gets better. Mickey gets a new client, Louis Roulet, who is the son of a wealthy real estate agent. Louis is accused of brutally beating a prostitute. Mickey jumps at the chance to defend this upstanding, wealthy, obviously innocent client, but maybe things are not what they appear on the surface.The story moves at a good pace and is never boring. There is a network of inter-connecting stories that are all related and come together in the last several chapters. The author does an amazing job at bring it all to a satisfying conclusion that will put a smile on your face at the end."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"My experience with Michael Connelly novels comes entirely from audiobooks, and the actor who reads the Harry Bosch novels is not very good, especially compared to the guy who does Lincoln Lawyer. So that may effect my impression that the narrator of this book, a lawyer, is a lot more interesting and appealing than Connelly's usual hero, police detective Harry Bosch. Bosch is a self-righteous hothead who's too noble in a too-obvious way. Mickey Haller is, by contrast, much more like wily Odysseus than raging Achilles. I like the character's cleverness in working the dramatics of the trial, and the touch of moral ambiguity makes this more realistic and mature novel."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I really loved this book. I thought it was exceptional. It is better than the Harry Bosch novels the aurthor writes. If the author is reading, would you please write another one with him? Thank you so much!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly book to read and I was very impressed. The first half of the book starts out a little slow building the facts of the case, but the second half of the book is where all the twists are. The book definitely gives you insight into criminal defense strategy and how the \\"system\\" works.Definitely an entertaining read. I would highly recommend this book. I reserve 5 stars for only the most outstanding books."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I have just skimmed through the previous 250(!) Amazon reviews. The great majority of them are extremely well-disposed toward this book--as am I--and most more than adequately set out both the main characters and the mainspring of the plot. I see no reason to repeat any of that in this 251st kick at the can.It did, however, strike me as worth observing that as this is a book about a lawyer and as many of its scenes take place in a courtroom, the reviewers have made references to and comparisons with the works of contemporary literary legal eagles, such as John Grisham. No reviewer, so far as I noticed, seems to have hit on what appears to me to be a far more obvious model.Throughout the book, author Michael Connelly follows normal current practice by allowing us to know the thoughts, plans, schemes, frustrations and short-comings of his lawyer hero, Mickey Haller. If, however, a reader subtracts Connelly's internalized dialogue and commentary from the book--thus cutting its length by half and increasing its narrative speed exponentially, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is transformed into a latter day Perry Mason novel. The very same core characters are there, albeit under different names: a dazzling, if sometimes taciturn master of courtroom wizardry; an adoring secretary/assistant, Mason's Della Street; an adversarial police investigator, Mason's Lieutenant Tragg; an on-call private detective, whose name in the Mason books eludes me for the moment; and most especially, a foredoomed but ever-game DA, Mason's Hamilton Burger. The relationships of the characters in Connelly's tale are virtually identical with those of Perry Mason's merry band.Erle Stanley Gardner was utterly indifferent to such narrative go-slow zones as back-stories or internalized agonizing. He told us nothing about Mason's personal life, save that there was SOMETHING going on between him and Della Street and that for some reason he could not or would not formalize the relationship. We never heard of Mason's doubts or of his insecurities, nor were we shown his lapses from probity or other failings. Gardner quite intentionally showed us no more than Perry Mason's game face.Here, in Michael Connelly's book, his lawyer's game face is so similar to Mason's that he might have bought it at the sale of the old-time mouthpiece's estate.Now, before someone rises up to pounce, I admit that there are certainly differences between the books about the two lawyers. Connelly's characters, for example, pointedly lack the near-immunity from physical harm possessed by the continuing denizens of the Mason stories. Nevertheless, I maintain that the overall similarities are far greater than the differences.I look forward to future battles between Connelly's updated, Mason-like defense attorney, Haller, and that ADA whose nose he figuratively bloodied in this book. (And maybe next time, Haller will even be able to convince a villain to confess on the witness stand!)Four stars."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I always love a good thriller, mystery, lawyer \\"story\\" where the end really does surprise me.

Sorry I have heard that it is excellent and that was why I purchased it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Most Connelly fans are familiar with Harry Bosch, the protagonist in the majority of his crime thrillers. In \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" Connelly gives us a break from the Bosch series and introduces us to Michael Haller, a defense attorney who embodies all the things we love to hate in lawyers: no real interest in justice - just winning, getting the bad guys off on technicalities, running those tasteless full-page ads in the phone directory, and defending the very worst elements of society as long as they can pay his fees.Haller conducts his practice largely from the backseat of his black Lincoln (hence the name of the book), chauffeured by a former client who couldn't pay Haller's fees and is now working off the debt. He's twice divorced, has a young daughter he rarely sees, is deeply skeptical of the system that has enriched him, and counts among his clients the local motorcycle gang, drug dealers, and prostitutes. He's even begun to like the rap music preferred by a number of his clients. Beginning to get the picture? Not exactly the most endearing qualities in a main character.But as the book unfolds, Connelly shows us the man inside of Haller - a man deeply ashamed of his ethics, his parenting, and his contribution to society. Essentially, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a book about the redemption of Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller and his road to that redemption through a series of harrowing twists and turns. In the process, Connelly makes us truly care about Haller, in much the same way that his ex-wives, who both figure somewhat prominently in the story, manage to still find him endearing. As readers, we begin to see what these women actually liked in the guy - even though he personifies just about every slimeball lawyer joke we've ever heard.Haller never bothers to determine whether his clients are actually guilty or not because guilt is a foregone conclusion - given their chosen professions. Claims of innocence are simply part of the game, issuing from the mouths of habitual liars, cheats, and swindlers. But Haller lives with the nagging fear that if a truly innocent client actually crosses his doorstep someday, he'll not only be unable to recognize innocence when he sees it, he'll not know how to defend it. His is a practice of helping clients avoid what they deserve. What happens when the tables are turned and a client is facing something he doesn't deserve?Such does the book find Haller when Louis Roulet, a wealthy real estate broker to the Beverly Hills elite, enters his life. Charged with the assault and attempted murder of his date, Roulet retains Haller, proclaiming his innocence and staunchly resisting a plea bargain to a lesser charge. Roulet insists on taking this one to the mat to prove he's not guilty. And Haller concludes he's finally met the truly innocent client that has eluded his practice all these years.But in predictable Connelly fashion, what we get is much more than first meets the eye. Is Roulet really the model citizen he portrays? Have all of Haller's previous clients been guilty as he assumed? Does some integrity actually live beneath Haller's thousand-dollar suits?Connelly does an excellent job of developing the characters in this book, and Haller turns out to be more 3-dimensional than the impenetrable Bosch of his other novels. I found myself really liking Mickey Haller, admiring his intelligence, and hoping a character as much in need of rehabilitation as his clients would do us proud by the end of the book.Like many other Connelly books, the ending comes in two distinct parts. First, the identity of the crime's perpetrator is revealed with many chapters to spare. But then, through a series of intricate twists, the involvement of others is brought to the surface much closer to the end. It doesn't wait until the final chapter to reveal every card in the hand; it merely waits until the final pages to reveal that last card. I particularly enjoy that about Connelly's style, and it gives most of his books a satisfying sense of completion and resolution, rather than something rushed, breathless, and abrupt.I highly recommend the book, and Connelly leaves the door wide open for sequels now that he's introduced us to Mickey Haller. I'm hoping we'll see Haller again in the future."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer was my first Michael Connelly novel. I read a lot of Tom Clancy and felt like I needed to do something different. I took a chance on it because it was a book that people who read Walter Mosley also purchased. I started reading it and found it hard to put down. Fast paced and many plot twists. I finished the book two days ago and am about to order another Connelly novel.I hope to see this book as a movie."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Or should I have said even if he's a scum sucking bottom dweller? Haller's joke, not mine. Even though Haller works on the fringes of legality, you'll find yourself rooting for him throughout his foibles, schemes, deals, and losses.Like he says \\"there is no client as scary as an innocent man.\\" You'd better believe it. The thing is with Connelly's novel, he's right on the money. This isn't about the virtue of our legal system, because that was broken years ago. This book is the real deal--it strikes right to the core of where we are \\"hanging\\" in the balance and the scales of justice are tipped in the wrong direction. Anyone who's ever been wrongfully accused of anything, even speeding, will empathize with the world Connelly has painted in his best novel yet--the Lincoln Lawyer.The law isn't about truth, and it's only for those who can afford it, and Connelly demonstrates this to perfection in a suspense thriller that will have you by the throat until the last page. Prosecutors aren't out to save the innocent man or put away the bad guy, they're simply playing the numbers game--collecting wins and doing so by whatever means it takes. And Haller shows us there really isn't much difference in the guy, like him, who provides counsel for the reprehensible criminal, and the guy, like the DA, who bends all the rules he's sworn to uphold, doesn't play nice or fair, but only plays to win so that he/she can rise in the system.If I sound jaded, I am. But that doesn't take away from the great characters, taut plot, and tightly scripted narrative of this great book. This is unpredictable which makes it so worth the read. There's no way to know the courtroom outcome or the final outcome and that's why I believe Connelly makes a great story teller. And, Connelly is working his way up the food chain to become a great mystery writer with enough wit and reality to keep you wanting more.Keep em coming Connelly. You've found your calling."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Like Connelly's other standalone novels such as Void Moon and Blood Work, The Lincoln Lawyer is a forget about everything else until you reach the last page thriller. Obviously Connelly's successful Bosch series is very popular and like with Alex Cross for James Patterson there are undoubtedly a large number of passionate fans who would be more than happy if all his time was spent writing more in that series. I am not one of those people though, and really look forward to these independent storyline thrillers and can tell you The Lincoln Lawyer does not disappoint.Micky Haller is a defence attorney and the type police and most others look at with disgust because he represents those coming from the worst of the criminal world and sees nothing wrong with finding a technicality to let a client he knows is guilty of a horrendous crime walk. With an expensive property to keep payments on he is ecstatic when Louis Roulet who is captured in the act of trying to rape and murder a woman requests his services as he knows this will take up much court and research time which will have his expensive billing attached. As he uncovers secrets of the victim and it looks like he might not even get to court because his client is clearly innocent he does everything he can to delay the case being dismissed as his gravy train will go with it. As his father told him there is nothing more dangerous than the rarity of a client who is actually innocent. It is not long however before he learns that the victim was not alone in not telling the truth and what he thought was a slam dunk is more than likely going to put his client in the slammer. It soon becomes not only his client's freedom at stake but his as well if Roulet if found guilty and that is if Haller's lucky not to be killed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I listened to this book on tape- AWESOME, TERRIFIC, GREAT, WONDERFUL.

This book has everything you want in an entertaining read -- a fast, fun plot, quirky yet believable characters, and an ending that doesn't let you down. Though not as deep as the best of his Bosch books, it more than makes up for the lack of complexity with a hilarious sensibility that matches the humor in Carl Hiassen's or newcomer Jeff Sherratt's books in the same genre."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"You can't go wrong with a book by Michael Connelly. His Harry Bosch series is one of the best written in the business. He doesn't disappoint with \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". The plot is fully developed and full of surprises with a real twist at the end. Even though Mickey Haller is not always the most ethical lawyer, he gets justice for both of his clients that are the focus of this novel. I hope this is the first of a new series by one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"'Lincoln Lawyer' is not a bad book. If Harlan Coben had written it I would say he's making great strides in his work. But this book came from Michael Connelly, of whom great things are always expected; and if you think this is one of Connelly's better works then you need to go back and re-read anything from 'Black Echo' up to 'Angels Flight.' 'Lincoln Lawyer' lacks the almost suffocating atmosphere present in (most of) the Harry Bosch books. Worse, 'Lawyer' lacks the depth of characterization of those books. Neither can I commend this book for it's tight plotting because the solution to the 'mystery' was more than a trifle obvious. And yet I had fun reading this book...honestly, it isn't a bad book. But it isn't vintage Connelly either."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Unless you're ready to lose a lot of sleep, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. I've read everything Connelly has written and this is his very best. Mr. Connelly, if you're reading this review, please, more more more! More Michael Haller."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"If there's one thing I've learned about a court of law is that its a place of work. There's all kinds of business being conducted that has nothing to do with the case in front of the judge. And so, like many places of work, its not so interesting. Court procedurals can be as reviting as somebody telling you about their softball game, inning by inning. Michael Connelly's milquetoast protagonist Mickey Haller is a lawyer and he--hold the phone--works out of a Lincoln Towncar. Turns out, not that much. Most of the time he's in court explaining all the boring insider details of the LA court system. But then he gets a franchise client, one that can afford to be gouged for a lot of legal bills. Unfortunately, you can see the plot of this one coming from a long way off and given that, if your lead character is as edgy as the shape of an egg, you're in big trouble. It's not that Haller doesn't have his quirks, its just that they're so pedestrian--divorces, money problems, deadbeat clients. Again, not so interesting. Turns out his client really did do it and now Mickey's in a bind. This book reads fast, but there are better books by Connelly."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Read the book a number of years ago. Gave copy to my brother.

Haller is used to defending the guilty, but what he fears is that this particular client may actually be innocent. An innocent and wealthy client ups his stakes tremendously. For Haller, this is the case of a lifetime, and it is one that he has been waiting on. After years of struggling financially, he might have finally caught a break. However, he cannot help but wonder why this young man has picked him when he could have afforded to hire any attorney of his choosing. Haller is good, but he is not necessarily a 'big name' associated with high profile cases. Is it simply too good to be true? Is there something that he is missing? Is his client really so innocent after all?\\"It didn't matter in terms of the strategy of the case whether the defendant \\"did it\\" or not. What mattered was the evidence against him -- the proof -- and if and how it could be neutralized. My job was to bury the proof, to color the proof a shade of gray. Gray was the color of reasonable doubt.\\"The Lincoln Lawyer catches your attention early on and never lets it go.

I hope the movie does it justice. I can't wait to get the next in the Mickey Haller series, The Fifth Witness."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"All in all, I liked this book. My problem with it was that I just couldn't stand the major character who I hesitate to call a hero. Mickey Haller is a defense attorney who owns four Lincoln Town Cars which he bought at once when he had a big-paying client. He uses one as an office, driven by a former client he helped big time, and when that Lincoln gets too much mileage on it, he sells it and uses the next one. At this point he has two left in the garage he has been loaned by the father of another client he helped. Meanwhile, his second ex-wife lives in a condo which she uses to be his office staff, answering the phone, sending correspondence, tracking down paperwork he needs, and sometimes showing up in court. They are friends, just can't stand to be married to each other. For one thing, he still loves his first ex-wife, the mother of his only child. That ex-wife is a prosecutor. If you think that causes a problem, you're right.Haller's clients are invariably guilty and success for him is a deal that cuts down the prison time for them or even gets them off on probation, depending upon the crime of course. His greatest fear is that he'll get a client who is actually innocent and he won't realize it. Well, guess what - he thinks he has one finally and the guy is rich enough to pay staggering fees, but in truth . . . well, you'll have to read the book or see the movie to find out. Meanwhile, a former client sitting in prison really is innocent and Haller thought he had done him a big favor by getting him prison instead of execution. Oops! The plot is a good one.Michael Connelly has created a believable, if unlikeable, character here. He does show that Haller normally does things legally and that he does have a heart, but the concentration is on how he can skirt the law to get the best deal for his clients. He comes off as an ambulance chaser to me. That's why I doubt if I'll see the movie even though I think McConaughey is probably well cast in the role."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Mickey Haller is the type of lawyer that gives lawyers a bad name. His number one priority is getting paid. Under his jaded surface is a code of ethics of some sort, although he does give cash gifts to bail bondsmen and others who might send clients or favorable verdicts his way. He does, however, respect the law, and he even holds a bit of compassion for the underdog. He doesn't do pro bono work, though, except in the case of one drug-addicted prostitute, and he is allowing a former client to work off his fee as the driver of his Lincoln Town Car. There's a reason this book has been made into a movie: thrillers don't come any better than this, and it's Connelly's first legal thriller. A wealthy realtor named Louis Roulet enlists Mickey's services, claiming innocence to a charge of assault and attempted murder. Quite a bit is made of the adage that an innocent man is the most difficult to defend, because no plea bargain is acceptable; the only satisfactory outcome is a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Is Roulet really innocent, though, or just a privileged sleazeball? The book answers this question fairly quickly, and Haller faces more than a few conundrums, as he finds that Roulet's case is related to that of a previous client, who is currently serving time and still maintaining his innocence. Of course, there has to be a woman somewhere, and that would be prosecuting attorney Maggie McPherson, one of Haller's two ex-wives. She's seldom his court adversary for very long, though, because she is obligated to recuse herself when she and Haller are assigned to the same case. Haller's other ex-wife, Lorna, is essentially his office manager. His relationship with these two women is very revealing, with regard to his relationships in general. He doesn't burn his bridges, because everyone has a purpose. He does become more likeable as the book steamrolls to its conclusion and his meticulously laid plan unfurls."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Loved this book. Now I can't wait to see the movie and see how they are able (if at all) to correctly convey this story to the screen. I just don't think it can be done, for so much was in the character."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Unfortunately, I did not read the book before I saw the movie trailer, so I had Matthew McConaughey's face in my head when I did read it, but that's the only downside to this excellent novel. It moved quickly and kept me interested as well as concerned for the characters I had come to like. Outstanding plot development similar to John Grisham's early work. This will obviously become a franchise series that would make the Lincoln Lawyer proud. I will certainly buy into future offerings for as long they continue to be as tightly written as this one."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I suggest you not read too many reviews about the contents before you get involved with this book! Also suggest you absorb every detail with little distractions while reading or you'll miss important pieces to this amazing novel by Connelly! How many great descriptions can I apply to this? Gripping, detailed writing, surprising, suspenseful, great main character, fast paced, etc. etc.Makes me think the movie can't possibly capture all the details going through the mind of this defense attorney?--Will see!!If you like courtroom dramas and the behind-the-scene maneuvers--this is it!Fantastic read!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Unfamiliar with Michael Connelly, I was most pleasantly surprised after purchasing thiswhen an unexpected surgery found me home bound.While not a fan of some of Mr. Haller's tactics and unsavory clients, I found it impossible not to be sympathetic to his character. He's just rough enough to be interesting while still being likable in his personal life.Mr. Connelly is meticulous in his writing, maintaining continuity throughout his book andluring the reader into the plot. His style is easy and his story propels the reader onward,unable to stop mid-book.I was not disappointed with this purchase and am eagerly looking forward to catching upwith his past works.If you savor well-written reads then hop in, buckle up and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first time reading a book by Michael Connelly....I loved it...could not stop reading it and CANNOT wait to see the movie!!! I would reccommend it to others!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Fabulous & fast paced, I love all the MC novels. I've read this 2x already and cannot wait to compare it to the movie. Great theme with the office, I love it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Love all things Michael Connelly as his writing never disappoints. I hope he keeps writing for many more years. I discovered him late but it's fun catching up!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"1 have read most of the Mickey Haller series with a few more to go. I found from the first page I wanted to keep reading to the last page. The author makes you feel like you are riding around in the Lincoln.Good book. Great series."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I've enjoyed Michael Connelly's books for years. Between his exceptional series featuring LA investigator Harry Bosch and his stand-alone novels, Connelly is almost always at the top of his game. That being said, I held off reading his first legal thriller, The Lincoln Lawyer, for a while, because that genre tends to frustrate me. I know that corruption sadly exists nearly everywhere, but the extent to which legal thrillers portray defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges and jurors--not to mention defendants--as purely evil starts to stretch my disbelief from time to time. But with the movie adaptation of the book on the horizon, I thought I better get to reading.Mickey Haller is a fairly successful defense attorney in LA. He doesn't believe, nor does he care, that any of his clients are innocent. He'll defend nearly anyone, as long as they can pay him, and spends most of his days in the back of one of his Lincoln Town Cars, being driven from courthouse to client meeting to jails and back again. Mickey's biggest desire is for a \\"franchise client,\\" one that can bring in a lot of money and lead to favorable publicity and other jobs. He believes he's found this in Louis Ross Rolet, a rich playboy who is accused of brutally beating and threatening to murder a prostitute. Rolet vehemently insists he is innocent, and evidence that Mickey's investigator finds points in the same direction. And then information surfaces about another of Mickey's cases that makes him begin questioning the foundation of his entire practice of law, and brings him face to face with a pretty dangerous criminal. (As always, I'm being pretty vague so as not to spoil any of the twists.)This book had me from start to finish. Even though pieces of the story seemed a little formulaic, Connelly threw some good twists into the narrative and really fleshed out many of his characters. While Mickey seemed to be the quintessential defense attorney at the start of the book, Connelly revealed his layers little by little, until you found exactly what made him tick. And while I was fairly sure I knew how the story would wrap itself up (and wasn't entirely wrong), it didn't matter, because I found myself on a very compelling route toward its conclusion. Is this fine literature? No, but this is a really enjoyable addition to Connelly's work, and it just proves how exceptional a writer he is."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This wasn't my first taste of Mickey Haller. I read the second book, The Brass Verdict, about three years ago, so I was already familiar with him and his unconventional ways. This book is a great introduction to Haller, who is a stark contrast to Connelly's other leading man, Harry Bosch.Haller believes in doing what he has do to get the job done, whether it's negotiate with drug dealing bikers or arrange for a client to drive him around to work off his bill. When a big money client comes his way in this book, he soon finds out that some things are too good to be true. Even the best lawyer can be out-manipulated from time to time.I really like Haller as a character. He's entertaining and loyal and charmingly still hung up on his ex-wife. The audiobook was very well-done, and I'll probably continue digesting the series that way."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw the movie before I read this book, a big NO NO for me! ....BUT this book is so well written and moves very quickly and intelligently throughout the plot that I was able to really enjoy the book as much as I loved the movie."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Once again Michael Connelly delivers. This book holds your interest because as always he manages to keep you in suspense and yet he is just an ordinary guy with ordinary problems."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I enjoyed this book. When you start reading the book you think you may have already read because of the similarities between his books but then you know it is different. I like the style of reading from the different characters going from the attorney to his son to his girl friend. Interesting finish and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I an 72% read on this book. It is a great story by this author who really knows how to tell it. Michael Connelly's books always holds my attention. I'm never disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"good book. effective at capturing my interest early and keeping it. good at trying in fact with fiction. quickly took my mind off work."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my first Michael Connely's book. I liked both the story and writer's style. Michael Haller, protagonist, is a criminal defence lawyer and his office is back seat of his Lincoln car. Like any other lawyer, he is happy when he gets a high profile case of a rich realtor named Roulet. Roulet is charged with rape and attempt of murder of a prostitute. As Michael progresses with the case, the story becomes very interesting as new evidences unveils several mystries. Michael realises that the case is not a plain vanilla case as he thought earlier, but have several unconnected strings. Michael's and his family's life is endangered because of the case, but Michael solves the case. Book also gives a great insight of the daily working of court and lawyers. I do not want to say more about the story and spoil the fun.Overall, I liked the book and had a nice time crusing through it. I recommend this book.Happy reading !!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I had seen this book on the best-selling Kindle books for some time and was interested in it. Then when it became a \\"Daily Deal\\" for $2.99, I couldn't resist. I am so glad. After reading it I would have gladly paid the full price. It was an excellent mystery. It was said to be a 'thriller mystery', but it was more of a mystery than a thriller, which I am grateful for. If you like lawyer, detective, courtroom mysteries, you should read this. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the Mickey Haller series."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I saw ads for the movie and decided to read the book. I'm glad I did. Great characters, well written, kept moving, and had good twists. While parts of it were of the same thriller formula, there were enough new elements to keep it fresh and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I got burnt out on legal thrillers and hadn't read one in several years. I couldn't pass Lincoln Lawyer up when it was a kindle daily deal and I'm glad I didn't. It was entertaining and kept me guessing to the end. Now I'm going to have to rent the movie. Even if the movie doesn't live up to the book, I'll at least get to stare at Matthew McConaughey for a couple hours."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"It had a slow start, but I seriously couldn't put it down once the story got rolling! The writer's detail is incredible and has me holding on by every word!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"this is a good commute or travel book - well read and enough 'surprises' to keep your attention. Won't lull you to sleep - some predictability, but then, a surprise - nice. Enjoyed this."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I enjoyed this book so much I ordered it for my son knowing he would enjoy it as much as I did. I was correct, he enjoyed it also."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Great legal drama- well written, with characters that you can relate to. Great book!! The lead character (and his ex-wives!) are great characters, as well as the zoo of clients that you meet. I love the storyline, and was suprised to the end."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I finally broke down and read The Lincoln Lawyer. I think Connelly is an excellent writer, but somehow I had the feeling that this one wasn't going to deliver the goods. I was right. I gave it 4 stars because the writing itself is excellent, but it's the story that fails here. The plot has a ton of holes in it and the \\"bad guy\\" is just not convincing at all.Connelly creates a great character in Haller, and he brings his journalist's eye to the criminal court system. It's all rendered very well, but all of that great detail and writing talent can't make up for what is, in the end, a weak story. I feel like Connelly must have sensed this when he wrote it. There are places where he tries way too hard to make the bad guy into a diabolical genius and it just doesn't come off. In lesser hands, this would be a 1 or 2 star review. But Connelly is one of the best contemporary crime writers and he gets 4 stars from me based on that sheer talent. that said, readers would be much better served going back to the earlier Bosch novels. Many of those are truly outstanding."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I bought this book when it was the deal of the day. It certainly was a deal. I am not into deep analysis of books and writing styles. I either enjoy it or I don't. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read every day and this is the first book in a while that I could not wait to get to every night. I didn't figure it out. It kept me guessing every time I picked it up. It did not have 5 page descriptions of an object, so I actually read every word instead of skimming. Those of you that read a lot know what I am talking about! It was not redundant at any time. Simply put, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I had tired of cheap (in both senses of the word) Kindle Single crime books before I picked this regularly priced book by proven author Michael Connelly. I was not disappointed. It's a pleasure to read this well-constructed and well-written legal thriller. Its eventful plot and strong characters will make an excellent movie. One issue, though: why 524 pages? Does length really add value? I am not 100% convinced."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm a self-admitted addict when it comes to the legal mystery/thriller genre. I bought the book for a Seattle to Atlanta flight, and was so happy the plane had to circle the airport for an extra 30 minutes so I could continue reading it. The characters are engaging, Haller is interestingly flawed yet likeable and real. The plot is not a give-away, and the ending made me want to read the next Haller novel - which I'm sure will be on shelves soon. Buy it, read it, money well spent!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer will keep you glued to your seat and your fingers turning the pages at a very fast pace from the opening chapter to the last. The Lincoln Lawyer, a legal thriller featuring Mickey Haller, represents a departure from Connelley's police procedural series featuring Harry Bosch. It is every bit as good as the best of the Bosch series. Haller and the other characters are very interesting, well-developed and captivating. The pace is fast and the plot is filled with surprising twists and turns. At times, I forgot I was reading a book by Michael Connelly and not one of John Grisham's better books. In Mickey Haller, Connelly has created a character that, while perhaps not the most honorable member of the bar, is the type of criminal defense lawyer everyone would probably want representing them if the need arose. Haller has the potential to be at least as memorable a character as Harry Bosch and one that I hope to read more about in the future. Be forewarned -- once you sit down to read The Lincoln Lawyer, you won't be getting up for quite awhile!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Lots of interesting little sub plots and twists which weren't shown in the movie. The movie I saw was an in flight one and may have had some editting. I will be looking for other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Very interesting......but one thing I did NOT LIKE was after your completion of 5 chapters, you are interrupted with a preview of the next book. This preview is very much the first five chapters of it and then it returns you to what you were reading in the first place. Very distracting move! Don't know if it is amazon or the author trying to sell another book. The book itself was wanting to read the next sequence."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I read this novel when it first came out and totally enjoyed reading a new Connelly book that wasn't about Harry Bosch -- not that I don't like Bosch (I do), but that the change was really good. The pacing in this book is so different from the pacing in a Bosch novel, which is a crime procedural. And Mickey is so very different from Harry. In most ways. I liked Mickey's cocky attitude, his high intelligence, his quickness, and his ability to see who might be lying to him and why. I also enjoyed his relationship with his daughter and his ex-wife: it's obvious that he loves both of them.Balanced against all of this is Mickey's belief -- or at least he says he believes it -- that he doesn't care whether or not his client is innocent or guilty, he just cares about getting his client off.As it turns out, this is not true -- and the difference between what Mickey says he believes and what he really believes creates an interesting tension in the novel and helps drive the plot forward. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The story is crafted around a fascinating premise and the plot goes to confirm the writer's wide imagination. The pacing is good, the story flows smoothly and the setting is colourful. This is an accomplished piece of writing. This brilliantly written book is weaved in a confident voice and in a manner that attests to Connelly's attributes as a good story teller. The story caps on Triple Agent, Double Cross as one of my favourites of the summer. This well written story deserves to be treated with respect."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"When I heard that THE LINCOLN LAWYER movie had nothing to do with Abe Lincoln but rather with a lawyer who conducts business from his Lincoln automobile, I couldn't help myself. Shaking my head and grinning, I bought this book, and I am very glad!The lead character, attorney Micky Haller, is cagey and competent with matters of the law and in managing his business (barely), if not his personal affairs. Basically a good guy with some nice human foibles which make him easy to like and relate to.Right out of the gate, we see a tendency toward tardiness that I can relate to; one wonders just how good this guy is. Trust me: He's good. The reader is guided along a plot that seems fairly manageable until things change. I enjoyed every page. I found nothing illogical or nonsensical about the unexpected twists and turns -- always a good sign. I was pleased & surprised with the whole story and heartily recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of the genre!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"In recent years many books have been turned into big screen productions; Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight Saga', Harlan Coben's 'Tell No One', Jodi Picoult's 'My Sisters Keeper', but this of course raises the obvious question \\"Which did you like better, the book or the movie?\\" The answer for me in all the bookovies (even the ones listed above) is the book was better! In last few weeks my husband (a movie buff) has seen trailers for the latest bookovie 'The Lincoln Lawyer', I of course refuse to see it before I've read the book, so I put his plans on hold, grabbed the book and started reading.I'm not new to Michael Connelly having read 'Blood Work' (another bookovie, that was great on paper but failed in my opinion on the big screen) and loved it, so I knew Connelly's writing style would appeal to me, he's fast paced, doesn't get lost in introspective characters and keeps the dialogue interesting. I did find 'The Lincoln Lawyer' slow to start, but kept me engaged enough to keep me turning pages until it picked up around page one-hundred.Mickey Haller was a thoroughly enjoyable character, he's charismatic, witty, and surprisingly loyal. I also enjoyed the many minor characters Connelly brought into the book through Haller's other cases. It was interesting to read about the justice system, the cops dislike towards defence attorneys, the tension between the prosecution and defence teams. Connelly gave the reader a clear idea of what really goes on in and out of the courtroom, making 'The Lincoln Lawyer' that much more enjoyable and entertaining. Now, not only is it time to test my theory about bookovies, it's time to sink my teeth into 'The Brass Verdict' the next installment in Connelly's 'Mickey Haller' series."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I know not all protagonists are likable but I think Connelly almost went too far on Haller. From the very beginning money rules the roost, keeps taking over Haller and his ethics, if he has any. The author has written an intriguing tale about a despicable man yet has aroused my hopes for a change in behavior. I don't get it, Haller remains true to his greed but the story is fascinating anyway. To start with I did not tumble to the title, the car, not the man. it was the title that drew me to the book, then I went I guess half way through it before the connection occurred, Haller had no office, just his car and it was a Lincoln. When the light dawned I started reading the book for its content, not to answer my mind's question. I did not restart, I did not change my opinion of Haller but I did try to review what I knew about Jesus Menendez and Roulet to see if it made any difference. I was hoping Haller would jump to the defense of Jesus, but he did not jump, he fell onto it. I am not a lawyer but I did question Haller's inability to give the police information about Roulet's previous murders and I am glad to see some of the other reviews answered my questions. Also the ending seemed to me to be horrible, it all fell out quickly and in such a fashion to cleat Haller of any murder charge but I found it hard to believe. Even after the ending I had many questions unanswered and Louis's involvement in how many murders, who committed the others, but did it matter? Individual opinion, it mattered to me as well as how they were killed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"As this book has been extensively reviewed, I will be brief. Connelly is obviously a well known author and sometimes I have found that well known authors sell more based on their name (and just rehashing the same old stuff) than by originality. This author, however, knows how to keep it fresh. That's why I appreciated the Lincoln Lawyer. It's a great legal thriller and though Connelly is not a lawyer, he does a great job keeping you going in this book. Two thumbs up from me!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Have bought this book twice , each for as a gift after reading it. Enough has been said in other reviews for the positive. It has all that I enjoy in a fast moving pace and kept my intrest."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I got this book just m readin the reviews..I must say,its worth every penny..this is my first michael connelly book n his first based on lawyers...all i can say is, i just ordered 6 of his other books..."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer by Michael Connolly is thoroughly and completely engaging and thought provoking. I have become a big fan of his books and mostly it is due to the fact that you know he his protagonists are facing a major moral crisis and they always seem to come out alive, but not always undamaged. I enjoy how there are several ups and downs and sometimes some misdirections in the story. Still you can't tear yourself away from it.Connolly makes characters that seem real enough, are colorful without being cartoon like. He seems to skim the surface of being stereotypes and in many ways he offers an insight into how the criminal justice system really works. This work in particular offers an interesting client, some fascinating plot twists and an ending that is surprising to say the least and yet not so out of left field that it is patronizing and makes you feel like you've wasted your time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves truly great writing."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Calm down! I love Harry Bosch too, but this is really a great stand alone story. Mickey Haller is a defense lawyer whose office is his chauffeured Lincoln car. Even so, Mickey is no second rate rookie, he's a personality to be reckoned with. He's sought out by a host of unique characters in need of his help...and otherwise. Top entertainment, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The last book I read prior to \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" was from the \\"Scarpetta\\" series by Cornwell which was, as expected, an enjoyable read that kept me reading from cover to cover. I had never really heard too much about Michael Connelly but he showed some impressive credentials in the flaps, most paperbacks do. However; I was even more enthralled with this than the Cornwell and even caught myself in a subdued snicker from time to time during the process. The twists and turns worked for me. My hat is off to Michael Connelly, so I guess he's got a new client in me since I plan to read the Bosch series now. By the way, Hieronymus Bosch as in \\"The Garden of Earthly Delights\\"? That isn't too original is it? I guess it will be explained in the books.Rumor has it that \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is going to be filmed in the very near future with Matthew Mcconaughey as Mickey Haller. Personally, I had envisioned James Gandolfini in my mind but I'll just keep an open attitude about that. I'm looking forward to it nevertheless.Ciao!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly book. I picked it up on a lark at a supermarket book stand.

He's a sleazy defense lawyer who's a genuinely likable guy.

I thought it was an excellent book. I read it in 2 days. Been off work due to surgery. I have recently read The Bourne Idenity by Lundlum and Shutter Island by Lehane and I thought Lawyer was better than both. I felt for Haller and Connelly developed the characters well. In the end I actually found myself caring about Haller and Maggy. I would recommend this book to anyone. You wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Wow, what a great read!! I have long been a fan of Connelly's Det. Harry Bosch series of novels, so I was uncertain if him branching out into legal thrillers would be a good move after writing police procedurals for so long. Well, I'm pleased to say that Connelly pulls it off beautifully! Great plot, excellent lead character that is easy to warm to, truly evil protagonist and numerous twists and turns equals one GREAT book. Extremely enjoyable and addictive reading from the first sentence, I hope \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the first of many in the Mickey Haller series. It gets five stars from me!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"In what may be the year's best mystery, this legal thriller quickly captures the reader's attention and holds it, riveted, until the end, not because of issues involving legal procedure, secret information, or questions about the client's guilt, all of which are at issue here, but because the client and his lawyer are ultimately engaged in a chess game in which the lawyer loses if the client wins.The lawyer, Michael \\"Mick\\" Haller, an ethical man, is determined to do right by his client, but he, like many other attorneys, is looking for a \\"franchise case,\\" one for which the client can pay for all services and appeals, and thereby subsidize his pro bono work for indigent clients. The defense of Louis Ross Roulet, a young man engaged in the family real estate business, on charges of assault against women, may be Haller's \\"franchise case.\\" His other cases involve a biker arrested on drug charges and a prostitute arrested with possibly planted drugs. An old case involving Jesus Menendez, a man who pled guilty to murder while insisting on his innocence, also becomes important, since some of the evidence in the Roulet case resembles that of the Menendez case.Living and working primarily from his Lincoln Town Car, Mick, both vulnerable and tough, wants to do what is right but sometimes finds himself caught between competing demands on his time. By the time the trial of Louis Roulet begins, Haller knows that two of his cases overlap, and someone he likes and respects has been murdered.The give and take of the legal profession, the compromises and agreements made, and the legal slang feel natural in Connelly's hands, conveying the tension and tactics of pre-trial maneuvering. The relationships among defense attorneys, private attorneys, district attorneys, prosecutors, bondsmen, the press, private investigators, and politicians and judges in various court districts are clearly spelled out and show how things work in real life. Though the cast of characters is not large, the case becomes extraordinarily complex as the past and present merge. Roulet and Haller engage in a high stakes chess game of move/countermove, and the conflict becomes intensely personal, challenging Haller, morally and legally.Fascinating on the level of plot and character, the novel also offers intriguing glimpses of the ethical conflicts of attorneys who defend the sometimes indefensible and challenge the sometimes \\"cooked\\" evidence of prosecutors. This novel raises the ante of the legal thriller, revealing the emotional complexities underlying the defense attorney's commitments to his clients. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Is there nothing Michael Connelly can't do? After taking ownership of police procedurals with his Harry Bosch series, Connelly tries his hand at a Scott Turow-style legal thriller. And he nails it.The Lincoln Lawyer focuses on Mickey Haller, a Los Angeles defense attorney who knows the ins and outs of the system, especially as they pertain to his cash flow.Haller thinks he's got it made when he lands a \\"franchise client,\\" a wealthy real estate agent accused of viciously attacking a prostitute. The client, Louis Roulet, adamantly maintains his innocence, and Haller thinks the case will be a slam dunk.He's wrong. The case spirals out of Haller's control as it becomes increasingly clear that Roulet is harboring a secret or two (not least his past involvement in other cases, one of which may have resulted in another of Haller's clients going to San Quentin).This gives \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" two exciting shots of adrenaline: the lawyer defending someone he knows to be guilty of terrible deeds (including the murder of a friend), and the scheme he concocts to set things right without violating the attorney-client privilege and being disbarred.Connelly's work has it all -- sharply drawn, engaging characters, snappy dialogue and a plot that moves like a shot of Red Bull. As with Turow, he also understands that a good legal thriller is primarily about the law, not lawyers acting like crime-fighters. It's amazing how many authors seem to forget that."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I'm not going to write an exorbitant review about the character development and themes and that [...], but this is an exceptional book. There are several plot twists that are somewhat unexpected, yet the possibility was alluded to earlier. The story develops quickly, unlike many books that slowly develop and then cram everything in the last few pages. I found myself two-thirds of the way through the book and wondering \\"Well I could see that as the end of the story, what else can possibly happen?\\" only to discover another twist in the next couple pages.The book kept me reading and kept my interest from cover to cover, something I rarely find. It's not an incredibly intellectual novel, as it is an easy read, but it triggers much thought on the reader's part.Not one of the best books I've read, but it's up there!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly branches off from his usual PI/cop mysteries to provide a barn-burning legal thriller in The Lincoln Lawyer. This book rivals anything written by those lawyer-turned-authors, Grisham and Baldacci. In fact, The Lincoln Lawyer is so convincing that it's hard to believe it wasn't written by a lawyer.Mickey Haller is a criminal defense attorney working in LA. His clientele is made up of drug dealers, users, prostitutes, internet swindlers, and a host of other low-life individuals. Haller doesn't care if they're guilty of not. His goal is to get his clients off on technicalities. The bottom line for Haller is money, and he is always in search of \\"a franchise client--they are the rarest and most highly sought beast in the jungle.\\"Haller believes that \\"there is no client scarier than an innocent man\\" and he's afraid he won't recognize innocence when he sees it. But what he fails to recognize is evil when he takes on a client accused of attempted rape and murder. This shortcoming threatens his family, his practice and his freedom. Unfortunately, this client is rich and Haller is blinded by green. How Haller matches wits with a brilliant criminal mind will have you finishing this book in record time.Connelly's descriptions and observations of Los Angeles and the legal system are very shrewd. \\"Los Angeles County is a wrinkled blanket that covers four thousand square miles from the desert to the Pacific. There are more than ten million people fighting for space on the blanket and a considerable number of them engage in criminal activity as a lifestyle choice . . . every year you could fill the Rose Bowl twice over with potential clients. The thing to remember is that you don't want clients from the cheap seats. You want the ones sitting on the fifty-yard line. The ones with money in their pockets.\\" Or \\"The law is a large, rusting machine that sucked up people, lives and money. I was just the mechanic. I had become expert at going into the machine and fixing things and extracting what I needed from it in return. The law was not about truth.\\"Connelly is one of the top mystery writers today, and I have a feeling that we will see Mickey Haller in future books. He was mentioned by name in Blood Work, although never made an appearance. Hopefully for Connelly's readers, we will see him again."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"In the shadows of gray, Mickey Haller is as good as it gets. With four Lincoln Town Cars as an office, two ex-wives and a daughter he hardly see, Mickey Haller represents prostitutes and devil-riders in the labyrinth of the legal world. As a defense lawyer, he plays the system. He doesn't fight for justice. He doesn't ask his clients if they are guilty. Haller says that he feared innocence, but he should have feared evil, for evil makes him fight for innocence.With a tight plot that brings surprise after surprise, and with characters that both scare and entice, it is one of Michael Connelly's best. Fabulous."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is one of Michael Connelly's best books, which is saying a lot, because he has written a lot of terrific novels. If you have enjoyed Connelly in the past, then you are sure to enjoy this book as well. Although he takes a departure into the legal world, Connelly still sticks to his strengths - crime. Connelly is a fantastic storyteller that takes you through a crime being committed all the way until the crime is solved. And every time, you are on the edge of your seat.Connelly's hero (or maybe even anti-hero) is Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney that Grisham would have loved to create. He represents anybody who can pay and operates most of his day in the back of his Lincoln. The funny part is his 2 ex-wives and his relationship with them still - one is his secretary and the other is a prosecutor that he sees around the courthouse often. Louis Roulet is his \\"franchise client\\" who tells Mickey enough lies to make him question his innocence. The courtroom scenes that follow in this book were some of the best in recent memory of legal thrillers. It would make you think that Connelly used to be a lawyer because he has obviously researched it thoroughly.Strong points on this book is the balance of humor and suspense. Mickey's love of hip-hop music and funny comments and insights keep you laughing at loud. At the same time, the suspense keeps you reading rapidly as you try to figure out what Mickey is going to do next and who he can trust.I found this book very similar to Philip Margolin's \\"Last Innocent Man,\\" which I also enjoyed. Same basic plot where defense lawyer is tired of representing guilty people when he finally thinks he is representing an innocent man (and then begins to have doubts). Both books also have an ex-wife as an opposing prosecutor. Both also execute very well with a entertaining read with enough twists to keep you guessing until the end.I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes Michael Connelly or likes fresh legal thrillers. With so many authors in the genre now, it's hard to find a legal thriller as good as this!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Great escapist fiction: moves fast and corners well. And, at the end, I even liked the lawyer.Fortunately for me this author has a backlist for me to explore, and I'm looking forward to it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The last few Bosch novels have been really weak; since Connelly decided to soften Bosch, he completely lost the character. His writing's been getting better at the same time his books have been getting weaker, so I was hoping for a book that showed he hasn't lost it.This is the book.I'm sure there are some legal technicalities in this book that experts might scoff at; there are certainly gaping plot holes. But forget it; this book features great characters, great pacing, it's well written, it's suspenseful. It's a better courtroom drama than anything Grisham has ever done.I couldn't put it down. Even though the flaws are many (the ending is telegraphed early and thus what I think Connelly meant as a surprise seems anti-climactic), this is the sort of book that rises way, way above it's flaws. I'd place my order for another Lincoln Lawyer book right now. I think Connelly's found his new franchise character."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"In \\"The Lincoln Lawyer,\\" Michael Connelly provides all the tension, twists, human brutality, and insights into others' lives as he usually sends Harry Bosch to deliver. Mickey Haller is a great new character - smart and committed, but just distracted and honest enough to be deceived...for a while.This is also a great book to start with if you've never read Connelly before BECAUSE all the characters are new and fresh. While I love Harry Bosch, who is in most of Connelly's other books, it can be subtley awkward to read them out of publication order. This book will give you a good idea of Connelly's tough, but smart writing style. If you like it, go back and start reading him from The Black Echo -- it's well worth the ride."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"from police procedural to courtroom thriller without losing a step in his latest, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\".Connelly's tale of the deeds and misdeeds of criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller is his finest work in many years, and that is saying a lot. In the novel, Haller is lucky enough, through his bail bondsmen connections, to find a client who is well-heeled and likely innocent of a vicious crime.As Haller digs into the case, he's stunned to learn that his client is not what he seems, and his fear grows that he will, in obtaining the man's freedom, unleash a monster back on the world. He sets up a sting, of sorts, only to realize that his client is suspicious of his motives and that he's drawn himself personally into the danger surrounding the case.There are some plot twists and secrets that I won't reveal, that make the pace of \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" escalate, that make you unable to stop devouring each chapter. There's also Connelly's trademark humor, never more evident than in the way he arrives at the title for this book.Haller's a new, intense character for Connelly devotees to treasure. That he will come across Harry Bosch, Connelly's other prime time hero, at some future point, is likely. But, as a stand alone character, Haller's every bit as fascinating an attorney as the characters created by Scott Turow.Don't miss this novel, it is one of the year's best."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer was a good read! It slowed at times, but not for long periods. I found that it was entertaining and an easy to read novel. It is always good sometimes to read novels that are simply enjoyable and do not take a great deal of thinking. I would recommend this book to others, especially those readers that enjoy law based novels."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a very good book. I just picked it up a week ago from the library, and I have spent all my free time reading it - finishing it off last night. All of the characters are realistic and easily believable. The pacing and organization of the book are excellent. Revelations come at just the right moments, and the climax is very satisfying. Having finished the book, I'll definitely be wanting to go pick up the movie for a viewing, now, and I'll be looking for more Michael Connely books at the library. I was very satisfied with the book, and if you happen to be a fan of legal dramas/mysteries, you'll surely enjoy this book, as well. There's not much more I can say about this book that hasn't already been said by many other reviews, so I'll just keep this review short. Do yourself a favor and give this book a try!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Even after seeing the movie this book kept me hooked. Lots of fun. Connelly may be my new favorite author."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"For some reason, I was resistant to reading Michael Connelly's Mickey Haller series, probably because I am addicted to Harry Bosch books and resented Connelly taking time out from Bosch to write about a different character. (Odd, I know.) In any event, since there are no new Bosch books available on Kindle right now, I decided to give this Haller novel a shot, so to speak, and I'm glad I did.Mickey Haller is not the only great character in this series. There are also his two ex-wives, a prosecutor nicknamed Maggie McFierce (aka McPherson) and Lorna Taylor, who has remained Haller's friend and is now his office manager. There is a freelance private investigator, Raul Levin, who does most of Haller's detective work, as well as a cast of engaging cops, victims, bail bondsmen, judges, court officers and perpetrators.The plot is terrific and Connelly's writing is superb as always. The murderer is revealed about half way through the novel, which in this case serves to make the book even more intriguing, as Haller is presented with a dilemma that seems unsolvable. Of course, Haller figures it all out and readers will be mesmerized right up until the end of the story.Now that I have made Haller's acquaintance, I have downloaded two more novels starring this most off-beat attorney. Can't wait to get started on them."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I've read it twice now - once on my own when it was first released, and once for book club. The second time around, I decided I really didn't like the ending. I loved everything right up to that point, though. Second reading was June 2011."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly did a superb job of putting you in the action. You felt that you were in every scene. The action was more verbal and thought provoking than physical and yet some physical. One way to describe this book would be fantastic. I would recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main charactersare saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Anyone with interest in the legal system will immensely enjoy this novel. For me it does a much better job than watching it on the screen. The words and ways that are used really show that our laws are a great thing but it can take the participants deep into the whirlpool of unknown hatred, mystery and lies. In this Novel Mickey Haller a defense attorney hits the jackpot. He obtains the franchise defense lawyers hope for. A women is beaten nearly to death. The arrest of a high end realitor is effected. He and his wealthy family strongly represent his innocence even though he was with her from an appointment for sex. He states he woke up with her beaten and two guys sitting on him. He had blood on his hands and a knife was found. By all evedence he is guilty. The story progress's and then strong twists and turns occur. They threaten others that are close assistants in the case. The worse is his ex-wife and child are entered into this horrible position of fear.Suddenly Mickey is near arrest on a murder of one of his fellow workers. The novel continues with all the legal enjoyment you may know or wish to understand. I enjoyed it and I'm sure you would also."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is my very first Michael Connelly novel, and was very excited to read it. I think the book started out on a good note. The character, Mickey Haller, is relatable and in a way epitomizes the standard definition of a lawyer nowadays. The plot reached a high-suspense level pretty early on, and I couldn't wait for the next chapter at every turn. The problem came towards the end of the book, when you find out the truth about things without any real twists. It was a straightforward resolution, predictable, perhaps even expected. I thought that the end would be more complex, and involve more than 2 pages after being in suspense for 400 pages. I must say that the ending can truly make or break the book, and in this case it missed the mark."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"(4.5 stars) This is a fast paced book that captivates your attention early and feels real. I enjoy a good legal thriller and this book is just that with excellent insight on the legal system and some behind the scenes information on how the justice system really works and can be manipulated. The courtroom scenes are also very compelling showcasing some excellent legal strategy without being tedious. Through the musings of the protagonist, Mickey Haller, the author also shows the ethical conflicts of being a defense attorney whose main clients are usually guilty. On the flip side, he also gives a lot of thought to the problems of representing an innocent person; it's dangerous because mistakes are not an option. As expected from a master like Connolly, the story has many twists, turns, surprises and tension. There is also wonderful character development and a plot that flows and steadily builds; once pulled in it's hard to put this book down. In summary, a great page turning legal thriller for all Michael Connelly fans and also anyone who enjoys this genre of book. Loved it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"What a fun story! Loved the relationships, the friendships, the surprises, the self depreciating humor of the main character.Very entertaining, I am looking forward to more fun with the next book."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I know I'm a late comer but had to say if you liked the movie, you will love the book. It's just as fast paced and action packed, but you'll get more detail and back story. This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read and look forward to more."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I bought this book last month and after a few pages realized I already read it. I buy all of Connelly's and a few other authors works as soon as they come out in paperback. I just realized Amazon displays the latest publishing date - not the copyright date or even the first paperback date so if you read as much as I do, and have a challenged memory, you can be easily fooled into buying older books. Sorry this is more a rant than review but hopefully it can alert other customers to this practice. Enjoy the book - I did - I think....."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Just finished this book...it's been a long time since something held my interest for so long. Every time it looked like I had figured out the plot, a new twist and set of circumstances popped up...afraid to say more...don't want it to be a spoiler. James Patterson, et al, have nothing on Michael Connelly. Looking forward to Connelly's next book and I don't generally read police/lawyer books!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I won't re-summarize the plot of this book since it has been done so many times already, but I will say that this is by far my favorite Connelly book. I have started other books by him that I didn't finish. As an attorney, maybe I am super picky about attorney-portrayals. Despite Haller's negative qualities, you can't help but love him (heck, even his ex-wives do!!). The best part of the book is the ending...did NOT see that coming!Here's hoping they make the Fifth Witness a movie sequel!!!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Read this Michael Connelly book first and now Im hooked on Mickey Haller.

It just kept getting better as it went along and made you not want to put it down. I normally don't like to read but this book was great!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the second Michael Connelly book I've read, and it cements his reputation in my mind, as a superb story teller. It must be hard for an author to come up with a new plot for a crime novel, but Connelly had me guessing until the end. If suspense is the name of the game, Connelly is a practiced practioner of the page turner variety. As a lawyer, I found the courtroom scenes realistic. The protagonist, a lawyer, is a character of the noir variety, meaning that while being personally flawed, doing justice is important to him. \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is now a major motion picture, and it could be a good one, but I'll pass it up because the cinema of my imagination is better for me than Hollywood graphics"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I made the mistake of seeing the movie prior to finishing the book so it ruined the end of the book for me, but regardless of that, this was a very good book. Some areas moved along slowly but all parts of the book were needed to fill in the storyline.

Will see the movie soon!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"It drew me in and kept me guessing where it was going.

Great suspense and will be reading more Michael Connelly books!"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This was a pleasant surprise and the first legal type thriller I have read, based on my experience with this book it won't be my last. A great story with plenty of twists to keep you hooked and paced just right to keep things moving along. There were definitely times I couldn't put it down and I enjoyed it enough to buy the second book in the Michael Haller series The Brass Verdict. I'm hoping it is as good a read as this one was.

This is a first for a book of this type and I will be looking to read more of his work."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Loved the book! It was a nice change of pace to read about a different character. And of course, the writing is excellent. You're really going to feel like you're in the shoes of this defense lawyer.That being said, it's even more fun if you're familiar with Los Angeles where the story takes place. Lots of places are referenced in the novel that are even more fun if you've lived there.I will say that I thought the overall plot had been done before. I've read or seen a similar story before (which I don't want to give away). That was sort of a bummer when I was about 1/2 way through the book and could pretty much telegraph the rest of the story. But what made it so good is the writing style, and really being able to feel some connection to the main character. Great read."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"An excellent detective novel with lots of courtroomdrama.

It was one heck of a rip-roaring tale.The only reason it got 4 stars and not 5 was, because as other reviewers have pointed out, the main character could have called the Bar's ethics hotline for help with his problem. Admittedly, this would have sunk the entire plot, but it is an issue Connelly should have addressed. Most readers won't know this though and so it will not pose a problem for their enjoyment of the novel. In truth, it didn't really ruin my enjoyment either.That said, this is a fabulous book and is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This story starts out slow as Connelly develops some new characters. It was almost too slow for me. Also, at first I did not care for the main character, but he grows on you. My brother urged me to finish it, so I hung in there (we have similar tastes when it comes to movies and books). The book didn't hook me until about chapter 18 and I was up until after 2 a.m. last night because I HAD to finish it. I think if you can make it past the slow start you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is the best mystery writer writing now. It takes courage to introduce a new main character after the success of Harry Bosch. It is even more difficult when the personality and the venue of the main character changes. Mr Connelly does this with great success.Mickey Haller the Lincoln lawyer is a wonderful character. We know he is a minor scoundrel but he is lovable. His exwifes both remain in love with him. He makes the book wonderfulI will not get into the story other than to say it moves quickly. It is less a mystery than a character study and I loved it."},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"Michael Connelly is best known for his breakout novel THE POET and his hard-driving police procedurals starring Harry Bosch. But the latest addition to his ever-growing body of work is neither a police procedural nor a classic psychological thriller. Rather, it is a departure that introduces a whole new venue: a legal suspense tale titled THE LINCOLN LAWYER. Here he introduces readers to Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller, a defense attorney who is always looking for the \\"franchise client\\" who will change his life. \\"A franchise client is a defendant who wants to go to trial and has the money to pay his lawyer's...rates. From first appearance to arraignment to preliminary hearing and on to trial and then appeal, [this kind of] client demands hundreds if not thousands of billable hours. From where [Mick sat] they are the rarest and most highly sought beast[s] in the jungle.\\"Mickey Haller is a cynic with a philosopher's approach to life. \\"After fifteen years of practicing law [he] had come to think of it in simple terms. The law was a large, rusting machine that sucked up people and lives and money.\\" Of himself he says, \\"I [am] just a mechanic. There is nothing about the law [he] cherished anymore. The law [is] not about truth. It [is] about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\" He continues in this mode by stating, \\"I was needed and wanted. By both sides. I was the oil in the machine. I allowed the gears to crank and turn. I helped keep the engine of the system running.\\"As the novel opens Haller receives a call from Fernando Valenzuela, a bail bondsman he has worked with for years. Together they are waiting for that franchise client to drop into their laps. \\"I got something. I think I got a franchise player here.\\" The \\"something\\" is Louis Ross Roulet, arrested for what seems to be a bar pick-up turned deadly. \\"Guy's gotta be big money. Beverly Hills address, family lawyer waltzing in here first thing. This is the real thing, Mick. They booked him on a half mil and his mother's lawyer came in here today ready to sign over property...didn't even ask to get [the bail] lowered.\\"Haller agrees to interview the fellow in his holding cell at the jail, but he is too streetwise and savvy to even begin to think that this one is the case at the end of his financial rainbow. When he finally has the opportunity to meet this would-be client, Haller thinks, \\"Most of the time my clients have been in lockup before and they have the stone-cold look of the predator. It's how they get in jail. But Roulet was different. He looked like prey. He was scared and he didn't care who saw it and knew it.\\"One of the hardest stumbling blocks to a good defense is talk, jabber, chatter, sentences and paragraphs that all consist of words. Haller opines, \\"Most of my clients talk way too much. Usually they talk themselves right into prison.\\" After admonishing Roulet to keep his mouth shut, Haller leaves his new client in the holding tank and enters the courtroom. Valenzuela has already warned him that Maggie McPherson, aka Maggie \\"McFierce,\\" has been assigned to this case. She is \\"one of the toughest and...fiercest assistant district attorneys assigned to the Van Nuys courthouse. She also happened to be [his] first ex-wife\\" and the mother of his only child. She is not happy to see him. His presence here means she has to recuse herself from any participation in the Roulet matter, which could have been a career maker for her. But she gives the case up with good grace and still maintains her close friendship with her ex-husband.The overriding nightmare that haunts Mickey Haller is the possibility that he might not recognize an innocent man if he is ever called to defend him. As the case moves forward and he gets to know his client, he admits, \\"I felt uneasy about Roulet's story. It seemed so far-fetched that it might actually be true. And that bothered me. I was always worried that I might not recognize innocence. The possibility of it in my job was so rare that I operated with the fear that I wouldn't be ready for it when it came. That I would miss it.\\" Later in the narrative he berates himself for not being able to recognize evil when it stares him in the face.This conflict between good and evil is what drives the mystery writer. Without these two concepts they would have nothing to write about. And Michael Connelly is a master at grasping his characters' angst in regard to \\"good\\" vs. \\"evil,\\" which provides readers with just the right amount of suspense. Here he shows his talent as a master choreographer of the dance that lawyers perform regardless of which side of the courtroom they inhabit. His books are brilliantly constructed, the writing is strong and lucid, his plots have enough twists and turns to satisfy the most ardent reader, and his characters are always easy to recognize. He never writes down to his audience or takes them for granted.THE LINCOLN LAWYER is a courageous book in that it catapults Connelly out of the boundaries set by a series. Harry Bosch is a formidable and unforgettable character. He may be missed on this outing, but he is a staple in the top-notch procedurals that Connelly writes and will surely be back. In the meantime, this new novel will not disappoint those familiar with Michael Connelly or those new to his work.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"This is a little slow starting but when it does it's a \\"stay up all night reading\\" kind of book.

Published originally in Spanish as &quot;Historia breve del Cristianismo&quot; ('Brief History of Christianity'), this English translation by one Michael Adams is quite brief as well, even cursory to some. But, as Orlandis points out in his Preface to this work, he made the book short &quot;in order to make it accessible to a wide readership, to people who might not be inclined to read a more elaborate book.&quot; This being said, the author does manage to effectively profile the main events and theological developments which molded the Church to its present form. &quot;A Short History of the Catholic Church&quot; is orthodox in its outlook and does not neglect to mention unfavorable events and characters in Church history. Orlandis dedicates a curiously laudatory paragraph in the final chapter to Opus Dei, the lay organization which is considered controversial in some circles but enjoys at the same time the support of conservative Catholics including Pope John Paul II himself. In a more conventional vein, the author supplemented his text with a fine chronological table divided by centuries, but unfortunately did not insert a bibliography."},{"Title":"A Short History of The Catholic Church","review":"As we were coming into the Church in 2003, an owner of a bookstore told me, \\"You must have this book!\\" She was correct! Everyone, Catholic or Protestant should own this book. Everything you want to know is there - well, it alone will make you curious and want to buy and read more books, but this is History you need to know. As a Protestant I was so uninformed about what Catholics really believed and why they believed it. I also did not know the first 1500 years of history of the Christian Church. I knew the Bible and knew the Bible well - but I had jumped over the history between the Resurrection and the Book of Acts up to the Reformation.I keep a well-worn paperback of this Jose Orlandis book in a handy spot and always glance at it when I am in that room. I am always tempted to read a line or two. I sometimes feel so smug about knowing so much history and I was never a history buff. There are no opinions in this tiny book - \\"Just the facts, Sir, just the facts.\\" Let me know if you like it - but do go buy it - especially for anyone who is presently considering becoming Catholic or any anti Catholic. Everyone should own Short History of the Catholic Church by Jose Orlandis."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Man","review":"Allow me to say up front that as a great admirer of Machen, I don't believe that this particular book was his best. Because it is a compilation of a series of 'talks' delivered via radio during the 1930s, the consolidated written form does not read as well as a manuscript written specifically for a reading audience, rather than a listening audience. But the actual content of what Machen discusses here is outstanding and like much of his published material from decades past, is in desperate need of being heard today.Because this book is a compilation of timed radio talks, each chapter of the book is short, about 10 pages each. As is typical of Machen, even in a book like this that purports to discuss the Christian view of man, Machen devotes many of the early chapters to discussing God rather than man. Machen held a great resentment, properly so, of theologies and worldviews that glorified man which masqueraded as products of the Christian tradition. As such, even in a discussion about man, Machen very deliberately makes God the focus, particularly in the early chapters. It is here that the nature of God is discussed, along with His decrees and His attributes, particularly where the creation in general and man in particular is concerned. In a discussion about man, the reader might think early on that Machen is not really dealing with the stated focus of the book, but he is as is seen by the later chapters.It is in the last 7 chapters in particular where this book really becomes riveting, in my view. Machen's discussion of creation and the fall is very good. His treatment of original sin and its relationship to human responsibility is impeccable. His related critiques of Pelagianism, in all its forms, is devastating. Machen presents a very compelling case for the inability of man and the grace of God that intervenes in man's hopeless natural condition.As I said at the beginning, this book, while excellent, is not his best or most important contribution. While Machen was obviously interested greatly in matters of theological purity, he also was a student of culture and current events. As a result, these talks touched upon a number of cultural issues that were current at that time and there are points in this book where Machen devotes considerable ink to discussing societal issues rather than strictly theological issues. While some of the societal issues discussed here are still pertinent today, the reader may at times sense that the book is at least somewhat dated in these areas, and I confess that some of those discussions seemed at least somewhat off topic, though I certainly acknowledge that my assertion here is debatable.But in conclusion, this book still provides a much needed antidote to the man-exalting theologies that pack many pews in the American church today. Machen counters this trend with a solidly Biblical argument that confesses that it, like many faithfully Biblical arguments, will not win many popularity contests even among Christians. An important read on the nature of man and what that means relative to our relationship to God."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Man","review":"1. Nice little books of radio messages. Short, simple, basic.2. Also reflects Machen's catechetical background (The glorious &quot;Westminster Little Catechism&quot;). He learned it word-perfect by age 12. It shows. In this respect, Machen refelcts a more intelligent time period, when parents catechetized their children. Kudos to Machen's parents. His pedigree shaped by parental industry and love is demonstrated, methinks with little effort.3. A good brief on overall anthropological issues.4. For the seminarian, however, one needs the weightier works (although Machen could &quot;surely hang with the heavy-weights). As radio lectures, this was for the public.5. Worth having on the shelf after buying 25-30 of the heavy-weights."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Man","review":"God is in control. God is sovereign and the creator of the universe. God sustains His creation and is active in His creation, whether he chooses to use ordinary or extraordinary means (miracles).God is omniscience. God knew before the creation everything what was to be and all the alternatives. God is the same today, tomorrow, and yesterday. God is immutable. God does not change; Man changes constantly. God is self existent; Man is a created being. Man has a body, soul, and is created in God's image. The author of the book makes a distinction that man is made not created since God brought man into being from dust not exnihilo. Man was brought into existence through extraordinary means, but not created as the universe was. The dust was created, man was made. Substance started to exist when God created the universe. Man is dependent on God. God is self existent and self sustaining. God is spirit; Man is body and soul. J. Gresham Machen does not accept the theology that man is body, soul, and spirit. When Spirit is mentioned in the New Testament it is referring to the Holy Spirit- not man's spirit. The author also goes into a detail discussion about the brain, mind, and soul. A distinction is made between the physical means of thought and the thought of man constructed through the soul. The mind is part of the soul not the body. The theme of this book is about the distinction between God's perspective and being as compared to and in relationship to man's perspective and being. God is sovereign because he is all powerful and all knowing while man is neither. Calvinistic view of predestination is defended and a major factor in this book. This are written transcripts of messages given by J. Gresham Machen, but I thought it was a well written and organized work on topic."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Man","review":"i recomand this book to every christian. it must be read because the christian view should be set up as a world view of life."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I found the protagonist of the title story to be a bit shallow, and some of the situations a bit dated (sorry, I refuse to believe your daughter getting a diaphragm is the end of civilization) but aside from that, Goodbye Columbus is an extremely strong first book. You can see from his first work that Roth has a sincere and abiding interest in the post-war Jewish American community. And a lot of the concerns of his later writing are first examined here. The conflict between different familial generations, the ways we escape from our traditions, the ways we are still bound by them, sexuality (it wouldn't be a Roth book without sex), etc. His ear for yiddish-tinged dialogue is really rich and wonderful, and he seems to have more or less cornered the market on writing about jewish mothers and aunts with both humor and sympathy. 'The Conversion of the Jews' is one of the most anarchically funny things I've read in a long time. It alone should be required reading for any aspiring wise-guy"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"This was the book that put Roth on the map in a big way, and I had been looking forward to reading it for quite a while. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. It it is not that it was bad in any way, it just was not especially interesting in any way. Still, I will probably hang onto it because one of the short stories is great.GC is a short novel that follows the relationship of two young Jewish Americans in the 1950s. Neil Klugman is a kid from blue collar Newark who works in the town library and seems to be rather aimless about his future. He gets involved with Brenda Patimkin, a girl from the right side of the tracks, the daughter of a successful self-made businessman. She goes to Wellesley, wears the best clothes, and is an all-around J.A.P. It is hard to know what really brings them together and keeps them together for a whole summer, but the dialogue is very believable. The story is told in first person by Neil, and he relates how he gets to know the Patimkin clan, her regular guy dad, her polite but neurotic mother, and her jock brother. The title comes from a record the brother, Ron, has about saying goodbye to Ohio State after his last basketball game there. Altho Neil is accepted by the Patimkins, he never really fits in and never really takes to their way of life. It is in some ways an interesting look at 1950s America, but in other ways it is quite ordinary. Maybe life has not changed very much since then. At its best, Roth's prose is dryly witty and insightful. His style is regular and low-key. My guess is that his success has 'derived primarily from his timely choice of subject matter and the easy, accessible nature of the writing, but not knowing the other books too well, that is just a guess.Of the short stories, there were two that interested me. \\"Epstein\\" is about what I guess you could call a midlife crisis. An overweight Brooklyn businessman, surrounded by sex and youth, struggling with the continuing pain of his son's premature death, strikes up an affair with a widowed neighbor. The scene in which his wife finds out something is wrong - in which he has a rash on his thighs, and begins covering it up - is outrageously, painfully funny. \\"Defender of the Faith\\" is the best thing in the book - in it, a Jewish sergeant, back in the States after fighting in Germany, finds himself taken advantage of by a manipulative, fast-talking little private who uses their common faith as a way to wheedle favors out of the guy. At the end, the sergeant pulls a string of his own."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"A great collection that really acts as a first rate introduction to Philip Roth.In 'Columbus' where poor boy Neil becomes enamoured with rich girl Brenda after holding her glasses at the pool, you not only have a love story of Neils insecurities and self doubt that a rich girls motives are true,but great comic dialogue and characterisations that captures the changing culture of increasingly assimilated jews in America who's roots are still with their faith. Leo Patimkin's tales of poverty;Aunt Glady's world weary monologues-all seem to have grown and become part of jewish culture today. A story definately from the 50's when it was written, but with a timelessness as it captures so much of what makes us all human.The five short stories carry the whole Roth range; many of the tales and themes being re-enacted in his later novels.Again, the huge strength in character,dialogue, language and observation-added to the ability to tell a good story-shine. All look at the jew in the post holocaust world and the clash of old and new.'Defender of the Faith' is a stand out; a manipulative young soldier uses his faith to create an 'us' against 'them', yet is only too willing to trample over anyone for his own ends. 'Epstein' sees a man get a nasty rash after a brief affair (wonder what novel this gave fruit to?!)and 'Eli the Fanatic' tells of the assimilation of jews into modern scientific America and society, to the point of denial and shame.This book is perfect Roth; the one I would recommend if anyone wanted to know what he's like and all about."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"This is not a literary review of Philip Roth's work, but of the quality of this digital translation. I'm only into about the first 50 pages or so, but got so annoyed with the high frequency of typos in this digital version that I felt compelled to bring it to Amazon's attention. I just bought my Kindle a few days ago and this is actually my first digital book I'm reading, so I have nothing to compare it to in terms of frequency, other than paper books, however, for the price that Amazon is charging to download these books, the quality of proofreading should be just as good or better! This is unexceptionable."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I turned to Philip Roth's first novel, the National Book Award winner \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" (1959) after reading Roth's latest book, the short novel \\"Nemesis\\" (2010)NemesisI wanted to compare the themes and writing of this great American storyteller over these long years. And this was my first reading of Roth's early masterpiece. While an excellent book, \\"Nemesis\\" does not have the verve of Roth in his rambunctious, iconoclastic youth.Both the early and the late Roth novels feature a 23-year old male Jewish protagonist from the lower middle class of Newark, New Jersey. In \\"Goodbye Columbus\\", the chief character and narrator is Neil Klugman who, as the story begins is a graduate in philosophy from a local public university who has served in the army and is working in the local public library until he determines what he wants to do with his life. Neil is living with his aunt and uncle to save on the rent; his parents have relocated for health reasons to Tuscon. Roth has a remarkable ear for colloquialism and for the rhythmic speech patterns of Newark Jews.The story centers on a summer romance between Neil and Brenda Patimkin of the suburb of Short Hills. Brenda's family had its origins in Newark, but with the economic success of the father's business in kitchen and bathroom sinks, the Patimkin's have relocated to a wealty suburban home with all the amenities. Brenda is a student at Radcliffe and is spending the summer at home. \\"Nemesis\\", set earlier in the 1940s has a somewhat similar pairing of wealthy and poor Jews. Its protagonist is a young man, nicknamed \\"Bucky\\" (and Brenda Patimkin goes by the nickname of \\"Buck\\") who is in love with a wealthier girl, Miriam, the daughter of a physician from the near suburbs, and who visits her, at her invitation, at a summer camp in the Poconos far from sweltering Newark.Roth's Jewish characters frequently have a passion for sports and athletic activity, probably to counter stereotypes of over-intellectualized individuals. In \\"Nemesis\\" young Bucky is a physical education instructor who is gifted at hurling the javelin and at diving. In \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" as well, much of the story turns of Brenda's prowess at tennis and at Neil's ability to run. Equally important Brenda's older brother is a recent graduate of the University of Ohio, Columbus, where he starred on the basketball team. Much of \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" centers upon the brother's garish wedding to a young woman from the midwest.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" tells the story of the relationship between Neil and Brenda, which begins in chance, and quickly over a summer becomes intense and sexual. Brenda, pampered, wealthy, and spoiled and the rough around the edges Neil are attracted to and seem to want to love each other. But their relationship teeters upon their differences in economic background which led to suspicions and jealousy and backbiting. Neither family trusts the other, and ultimately the two young people cannot find a place for one another. Roth portrays masterfully these different social classes in American Judaism of the 1950's and the strong tensions between people of essentially the same background. He writes with genuine sadness about the failed relationship and with, in light of the criticism Roth's early work sometimes received, sympathy for both his flawed protagonists and their families. And in \\"Nemesis\\", Roth's late novel, he writes with nostalgia and affection for the Jewish community of his youth, both those of the poor inner city and those who had managed through education to reach the suburbs. In addition to showing the difference in class and wealth, Roth's novel turns upon the sexually repressive mores of the 1950s, a theme which also finds its place in \\"Nemesis\\" and in many of Roth's other novels.The short early novel of about 135 pages is masterfully written for a young writer as Roth develops both character and location. He is more at home with Newark than with the suburbs, writing, for example, \\"Once I'd driven out of Newark, past Irvington and the packed-in tangle of railroad crossings, switchment, shacks, lumberyards,Dairy Queens, and used car lots, the night grew cooler.\\" (p8) The plot develops with an inner logic and with tension. Every step tells and contributes to the story. To take one example, Neil describes his encounter with a young African American boy at the Newark library who escapes into the stacks to look at art books of Gaughin's portraits of Tahitans. (At that time many young boys looked at art books to see nude human bodies. Roth's young child seems to have a larger-based interest). There are parallels between Neil's relationship to the young boy on the one hand and his relatiomship to Brenda on the other. And the child's fascination with the far-away Tahiti suggests Neil's longing for the seemingly unattainable world of Short Hills and Brenda.In addition to \\"Goodbye,Columbus\\" this edition also includes five stories Roth wrote as a fledgling author. These stories seem to be the basis for stories that Roth attributed to the young writer, Nathan Zuckerman, in his book, \\"The Ghost Writer\\"The Ghost Writerwhich received criticism, in Roth's telling, for their claimed negative portrayal of American Jews. The best of these five stories is \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" which shows Roth's fascination with and skepticism about theological questions. Both \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" and \\"Nemesis\\" share this preoccupation with religion which ends, in both early and late Roth, in secularism.An astonishing early effort, \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" remains one of Roth's best works and is an excellent introduction to this author. I have been reading a good deal of Roth of late. This is a book I would have liked to have read when younger.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"This was my first Philip Roth set of stories, which is probably fitting since it was his first published collection of stories. At the time the collection garnered heaps of praise, eventually winning the National Book Award and starting a career that continues to this very day (if I recall Roth has a book out very recently, actually). And since I haven't read the rest of his work I can't really put this into context or say if he got any better or more incisive or whatnot. All I can really do is talk about this.And I have to say, it's pretty good.The title story is typically the one that gets all the attention and for the most part it's deservedly so. The story of a young Newark Jew's summer romance with a Short Hills Jew (and being from New Jersey myself, the very fact that I've been to some of these towns is exciting in itself) and his interactions with her well-to-do family succeeds by being very sharply focused, a slice of a year that winds up telling us way more about the characters than they ever do. It's Roth's keen eye for details that work here, an offhand description, a revealing exchange of dialogue. The small moments, like the \\"goodbye, Columbus\\" sequence that gets everyone's attention. Nothing in here is overtly \\"literary\\", he's not trying to do any formalist tricks, he's simply telling a story. And yet it's an examination disguised as a story, a switch that we never notice and only makes the story more deeply felt. It feels entirely naturalistic, like it happened to Roth itself, even if it didn't, but it's wrapped into a distinctly Jewish perspective as well as examining the nature of class. From early on you can see it not ending well, but given the characters there's no other way it could end. You believe in these people even if you don't necessarily like them.\\"Goodbye Columbus\\" is so quietly good that we don't notice how good it is until we read the rest of the collection and see how the other stories measure up. And while there's no missteps, nothing rises quite to the level of that first story. \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is the other big name here and comes close to deserving that status as well. It's more focused on the nature of being Jewish than \\"Goodbye Columbus\\", telling the story of a young boy challenging his religion through honest questioning and how that doesn't go over well. That story succeeds gloriously in its ending, with the final sequences causing the story to finally take flight, showing how accepting what you're told is never welcome, if that accepting causes pain for others. It reminds me of Henry Roth's \\"Call It Sleep\\", only without the underlying anger and the other Roth's more deliberate attempt to be literary.The rest are decent. \\"Defender of the Faith\\" depicts a Jewish soldier's attempts to deal with some other Jewish soldiers who are trying to get ahead of the game. It doesn't make anyone look good and in fact doesn't really make Jews in general look good, with everyone coming off as fairly manipulative for petty reasons. On the other hand, the ending is amazingly brutal in a quiet fashion. \\"You Can't A Man By the Song He Sings\\" is entertaining and slight but nothing more than that. \\"Epstein\\" feels like another Henry Roth piece, dealing with the despair of getting older and discovering that you've done nothing exciting with your life when you had the chance. \\"Eli, the Fanatic\\" is actually fairly interesting, examining Jews who aren't very fond of other Jews, when a more orthodox crew moves into town. The scenes where Eli, of a more conventional faith, has to deal with the newcomers, makes them feel alien even though both scenes share the same beliefs.What comes across in all these stories, no matter the quality, is Roth's voice. There is a definite Jewish point of view, not always flattering (often not flattering) and as such the stories examine a certain people's relationships with society and each other and how their faith informs the actions they take, overtly or otherwise. As a people, the Jews share a unity and history that many other faiths don't possess and sometimes that's not easily understood (I'm not Jewish, so interpret that as you will) but Roth gives us his view of a society that he understands all too well and even if he can't give us the roadmap on how to understand ourselves, at least he can show us where to start."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Here is Roth's masterpiece-in-stories, six pieces dealing with his trademark themes of love, assimilation, and maybe even despair. It begins with the famous title story, a startingly realistic college love story with deadly accurate characterization and a painfully truthful conclusion. From there Roth delves deeply into the American Jewish psyche, with characters that morph from sharply denying to acutely embracing their faith and spirituality. The overall feeling upon completing the book is of people forgetting their faith in the midst of a burgeoning sense of acculturation, and the shock delivered to the system when, through fate or circumstance, one has to deal with their fundamental self. Like the best of the fiction of its time, it is incredibly readable while also having a stunning tone and underlying structure. Every story is a knockout here, and will make you want to stay in the crazy yet somehow warm world that Roth creates. That he wrote such a collection at such a young age is stunning; thankfully it was the herald of a consistently brilliant career. An outstanding collection."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"In this initial work of Philip Roth, the characters almost seem too realistic at times. Though this is a collection of short stories, the title piece shines as the highlight of the set. Without a doubt, this is among Roth's finest works.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is an authentic tale of summer love shattered by an uncompromising society much like Romeo and Juliet. While one can doubt the strength of the young love of Neil and Brenda, the sound of young hearts breaking touches the reader. It is tale of conflict in love, caste, and mores in the era before the pill.Like \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\", the other stories use the Jewish faith as a central theme. \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" and \\"Defender of the Faith\\" are humorous tales that follow a theme suggested by the title. The scandalous lives led in \\"Epstein\\" with a skin rash serving as its conflict and \\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Songs He Sings\\" with mafia men in training stretch the boundaries of reality into humorousness.Any fan of Roth is certain to be delighted in this set. Though I am not usually a fan of short story sets, I took great pleasure in this collection."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"It's a literary masterpiece, realistic as it can be, Goodbye Columbus makes you feel as if you were 19 again. Neil's way of looking at life makes him a very interesting protagonist.Roth really scored a hundred whit this book, he makes the reader relates to the selfish feeling of a typical collage student, like Brenda. It makes you laugh going into two different mentalities such as Neil's and Brenda's.Intriguing enough not to let the reader know every detail, but to give him the opportunity of drawing your own conclusion."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Are you neurotic or psychotic?

The people and their feelings are just dead on. The Conversion of the Jews was kind of bizaare though. I enjoyed the story and what Roth was trying to say about religion but just didn't understand Oscar all that well.

Neil lives with his Aunt Gladys and uncle Max in Newark, while Brenda lives in Short Hills, a rich neighborhood. He falls in love with Brenda, and they have a summer sex-party with sessions every day at Brenda's home. Finally they're discovered by Brenda's parents and then all is over for them.

The content and message of the novel provide an enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"...by all the adulation that the novella Goodbye, Columbus and the short stories in this collection by Philip Roth get. They did not appeal to me, and I insist that I am not a Roth basher. Letting Go is a great American classic (see my amazon review), I very much liked Indignation, and I am engrossed in the Zuckerman novels now. But this collection is distinctly inferior in my opinion.For one thing, and I'm not going to rant and harp on all the little things that bothered me, there are many inaccuracies and implausabilities. Brenda's parents let Neil, the boy friend, live with them for two weeks in the summer? They would not be that nave. Ron, Brenda's brother, likes Mantovani? Come on! Pat Boone maybe but not Mantovani. Neil works at the library and helps out the artistic black kid. What a great guy Neil is. How very contrived and unconvincing. And so on.I come from exactly the same background and milieu as Roth, but I am about ten years younger. We are probably (distant) cousins. And I am telling you it was not like that, not like it was portrayed in Goodbye, Columbus. (Although I will admit that the dialogue is often brilliant. Roth is always a master of dialogue.)As for the other stories: \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is ludicrous, and marital infidelity revealed by a rash? All of the stories are amateurish and unconvincing. Perhaps these stories are bizarre Kafkaesque fantasies. They are not realistic portrayals and explorations of life. Nor are they particularly entertaining as fantasies, either.That's my opinion. So there. Revile me."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"A friend, who is an admirer of Roth's other works, especially American Pastoral, dismisses this as \\"sentimental nonsense.\\" I argue that \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" - the story itself, forget the five other stories (although they're good too) - is a classic. Certainly it is written in an autobiographical vein, and depends on its readers' emotions to be effective, but there is something more to this book.And I think lots of people miss that \\"something\\" when they say that \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is about \\"capitalism\\" or \\"social class\\" or even about secular Jews trying to find themselves - let alone each other - in our crazy, modern world. All of these critiques are right at some points, but they miss the crucial thing: \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is a love story, a very scary love story.If Roth gets anything right with Neil and Brenda, it is their absolute inability to communicate despite being two of the most educated people on earth. Neil thinks he's advancing the relationship - telling Brenda he cares - when he tells her to visit Sanger's clinic. He thinks by catering to her every whim that he's loving her. (What she thinks is unclear. The story is told from Neil's point of view and doesn't show Brenda to be particularly moral, or even thinking along such lines, at all.)And maybe in some perfect world, Neil would be right, his love would be made truly manifest in such things. But even he knows he's living a dream, at best. All that's left in terms of love in a world without commitment and tenderness is carnality, and that only goes so far...As I said, a classic. You'll have to read the book to find out if I'm right about it."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Readers starting out with Philip Roth might think this - his first book, published way back in 1959 - is the logical place to begin. But they might have a far richer experience if they come to it, as I did, after reading all of the Zuckerman novels along with \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" and Roth's slim but insightful volume of autobiography, \\"The Facts\\". So much of Roth's work is preoccupied with what it means to be a Jewish writer that it was fascinating to read, through the lens of that half-century of history, the book that began it all. Knowing (from \\"The Facts\\"), for example, what happened when Roth appeared on a panel at the Yeshiva University in New York in 1962, you can imagine just how incendiary some of this material might have seemed for Jews in post-war America. In story after story Roth troubles the notions that would be put to the young Nathan Zuckerman in the later novel, \\"The Ghost Writer\\". Should the Jewish writer suppress aspects of his work to avoid or counter anti-Semitism? Or should he be honest and risk including something that might \\"warm the heart of a Julius Streicher or a Joseph Goebbels?\\" There's plenty here to offend those who don't accept that Jews are human beings with all the complexities and contradictions that entails. Roth's agenda is not to insult his heritage, but to explore the anxiety of Jewish people as they struggle, for example, with feeling American but being treated like aliens; or wanting to assimilate yet wanting, equally, to maintain and defend their right to elements of their traditional culture; or, by the same token, wrestling with defending their faith against members of it who cynically exploit its observances and kindship for personal gain. The aspect of this book that troubled many, I suspect, is that Roth doesn't provide answers to these troubles. Rather, he seems to have followed Chekhov's advice to Alexei Suvorin: \\"You are right in demanding that an artist approach his work consciously, but you are confusing two concepts: the solution of a problem and the correct formulation of a problem. Only the second is required of the artist.\\" That's something the reader would do well to remember, too."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Neil first sees the elusive Brenda when she asks him to hold her glasses at the country club Neil is visiting. This book is a vital part of the collection of writingsabout the American Jewish experience.

Brenda's mother struggles with the ambition to be young and beautiful like her daughter and is angry at her daughter because Brenda is used to luxury. Brenda and her boyfriend finally end their summer fling as they realize the divide between their worlds really is too great.

There's a yearning here in a young man who loves a girl he really has nothing in common with. Roth captures the summer romance of youth. During the day, hanging out at her parents house and eating their food without feeling they have to pay for anything. And at night, he steals into her bed, sneaking into movies that are half over. It has a real fifties-early sixties feel, and I highly recommended the film (When I first saw it as a teenager it stunned me because I never saw a romance in films that didn;t work out because of differences--I mean it's Hollywood right, doesn;t everything end happily and people see the error of their ways through love. Well no.) I think the book is an excellent way for anyone to remember their own summer loves. It's plaintive, irritating, and awkward feel--really, the way I recall those moments too. Being in love but trying to find yourself as life comes between you and your youth. I re-read this book every year, and my only complaint is the male character isn't fleshed out enough, but then I think that is the way of being young and self-conscious, the adult world shifts by you, you feel detached and an observor. But passion is passion and it's there. And rueful but appreciated memories."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"First Love is a really wonderful novella that was the first work of Philip Roth. It was published in 1959 and won the National Book Award.What makes it so wonderful? The quality of the prose is exceptional. It is precise and often poetic without ever using that overly precious tone from which many short story authors suffer. Roth takes careful aim at upwardly mobile Jewish life-- most of the stories in the volume look at least subtly at the internal (identity) clash that arises as Jewish families start integrating into the mainstream middle class. What's nice is that he is unflinching and often critical without ever feeling as though he were being mean. Goodbye Columbus is beautiful and thought provoking, wry but not bitter.The novella is published together with five short stories, \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\", \\"Defender of the Faith\\", \\"Epstein\\", \\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\\", and \\"Eli, the Fanatic\\". \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\" is generally considered the best of the lot, but personally I was more drawn to \\"Defender of the Faith\\". All five stories are worth reading, even if they are not as strong as the title novella.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Indeed a book worth reading. Neil and Brenda\`s love affair is a clear example of materialism in love affairs. They also show a great amount of common sense as developed by Roth, which is very representative of his own life. Although brief, the characters are well developed, their attitudes are representative of the temporal setting (around the 60's), which sets the mood effectively.At first, we thought that the story was a bit slow, but near the end, the finale is magnificently narrated, showing the characters more humane than in any other part of the novel. We would recommend this story because you might feel connected to any of the main characters. Finally, don't forget to take a look at the title's symbolism; this can be a key factor in determining the true meaning of the novel (Tahiti-Gaugin-The Patimikin's fridge filled with exotic fruit-Christopher Columbus?-New World?-Neil's New World?)."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I think this is a good book even though I enjoy reading other kinds of books (like science fiction.) However, what I found special about this one is that it is very realistic. The characters and the situations in the novel makes you feel this happened in real life. The book is about the summer romance between two teenagers: Brenda Patimkin (one rich girl) and Neil Klugman (a poor boy). Neil sees her for the first time swiming in a pool, and falls in love with her. After that, they begin to love each other romantically; but after awhile they start having problems with each other, which will make you wonder if they'll stay together as a couple (but that's for you to read.) I'd say it is an entertaining book; it has funny parts, sad parts, happy and romantic. I haven't read other Roth novels, but this one is very good written. If you enjoy realistic novels, then it's a good choice."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"In Goodbye Columbus, Philip Roth first displayed his subconcious mind-probing virtuosity and the anti-hero proto-character, which would both become trademarks of his. Packaged with five very worthwhile short stories, this book, despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, remains one of Roth's most endearing creations."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Though definitely not his best work, _Goodbye, Columbus_ is an impressive first effort from one of the best authors of the second half of this century. Throughout the book one can sense the style Roth was creating for himself, and though this book doesn't exhibit that breathless virtuosity of prose, that mastery of the English language, of his later books, it's still a nice read.The novella _Goodbye, Columbus_ is a love story and a quiet meditation on a different type of &quot;class struggle,&quot; and a better example of Roth's style -- not to mention a better story -- than his next two books, _Letting Go_ and _When She Was Good_. The first of the five stories, &quot;The Conversion of the Jews,&quot; is a bit sick, but entertaining for that very reason. The middle three stories are a bit lackluster, but the book ends in high style, with &quot;Eli, the Fanatic,&quot; a story that manages to be both a moving story about conflicting loyalties (the goyim or the Jews) and a hilarious portrait of a nervous breakdown.I would not recommend this book to those just starting to read Philip Roth (try the Zuckerman Bound trilogy instead), but for anyone wondering where Roth's career started, it's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"...that states that everyone should read this book. The title story is at once hilarious and heartbreaking. Roth is one of the most gifted writers America has produced, and this (his first book) proves it.

Neil's way of looking at life makes him a very interesting protagonist. For example the way he relates to the little black kid of the library. Roth really scored a hundred with this book, he makes the reader relates to the selfish feeling of a typical College student, like Brenda. It makes you laugh going into two different mentalities such as Neil's and Brenda's. What makes it the best is that at the end the reader can make his own conclusions about what happened in the story and why it is name like that."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Goodbye Columbus is a good book about love, the lack of love and the gaps between society. It talks about the relationship between a middle class Jew and an upper class Jew. Phillip Roth exposes the differences between classes and uses the characters to show in a great manner the way of living and thinking of each part of the society. It also shows the lack of commitment that some teenagers may have and the problems that this may cause. Not to spoil the whole book for the readers the last thing that should be said is that the book is entertaining, even though some of the characters are not likeable; especially Neil. Everyone should read this book if they want to pass a good time and if they want to know about social conflicts."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Wow, what an enjoyable novella! I really love the simplicity of the story and the humor in it which would become Roth's trademark, along with his flawed protagonist. The five short stories are enjoyable as well and, together with the novella, form a very intriguing set of existential stories. I think Roth showed so much promise with this work that, despite the fact that he is one of America's premier writers today, I don't know if he's ever fulfilled that potential."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Reading this book I felt like I was reading Judy Blume's Forever but from the male perspective, in which that loser character from Forever gets to speak for himself and reveal just how much of a loser he really is.Romance between working class Jew and Jewish American Princess and the tensions. My girlfriend told me that it reminded her of me in that the working class guy is constantly challenging and fighting with his girlfriend in order to cover up his own insecurities. Our relationship got better after that.You don't really pay attention to the psychological aspect the first time because it's all about sex, when are they going to have sex, how often are they going to have sex, is she going to get birth control? And like i said before, the female character is not at all like the subdued Ali MacGraw in the movie. She's a harpy from the main characters perspective. When the story ends on a Portnoy's Complaint type note you are both laughing and sorrowful.The other stories are ok. Not great.

(actually, a lot of his characters aren't that likeable.) But &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, about some Jewish soldiers in WWII, blew me away. Absolutely one of the finest short stories I've ever read, right up there with Shirley Jackson's &quot;The Lottery&quot; and Ray Bradbury's &quot;The Veldt&quot;. The other short stories are also of highest quality, especially &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;. Be warned, though. He deals with very sensitive issues about the Jewish people &amp; faith. And he doesn't pull punches. As a gentile, I took his comments in stride, but I can see where people might get offended.

Both were still immature, especially Brenda who could not take her own decisions because, as a little child, she was influenced by her parents, no matter what she felt.

Each story has it's own characters and plot. Roth begins with a story about man and women who fall in love. They experience many conflicts such as family matters and working habits. The second story is about a boy who is trying to discover how Jesus was established as a religious icon. His misunderstanding leads to a crisis on top of a building. The third story is about World War II and a man's perception of the war and his experiences. The fourth story is about a husband and wife who are struggling with marriage conflicts. The wife believes her husband is cheating on her because he develops an extraordinary rash. The fifth story is about two boys who are in high school and are learning about baseball and true friendship. They develop a friendship that lasts a life time. The last story is about a man and his pregnant wife. They struggle with money and job issues, but somehow they learn to deal with their obstacles in life when approached by them.The short stories all have similar aspects to them. Roth uses very descriptive diction to project a vivid image into the reader's mind and to create a romantic tone in the story. The stories are easy to follow and understand because of the use of straight forward word choice and descriptions of the characters. The reader may find that the stories are short and unfinished, but because of this, the reader is left with suspense and imagination."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected.

Roth's style is easy to read and surprisingly humorous. The title story about a summer romance should hit home with a lot of people. I found the theme of love versus lust to be quite an interesting and realistic perspective. I think many of us could learn a valuable lesson here."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"This is Philip Roth's first acclaimed work, a novella about a Jewish twenty-something and the yearnings of young love, and five other short stories. Roth always touches on something completely exceptional by its normality, and tells a story in a gripping, intelligent and thoroughly honest manner. The title story is about a young man who out of youtful desire starts a passionate affair with a Jewish girl, knowing nothing about her or her family. He ingratiates himself into her life and family, while still remaining somewhat elusive and anonymous. He has no real family ties, with parents living thousands of miles away and an aunt in Newark whom he is trying to break away from. It is a fascinating story, providing yet another glimpse into Jewish identity and alienation, of which Roth is one of fiction's greatest exponents.The remaining stories are also outstanding; remarkably different from the title story, but each providing something of the present day (well, 1950's when the book was written) struggles with identity experienced by the post-WWII American Jew, ranging from a 13 year old boy undergoing training for his bar mitzvah and questioning issues of faith and tempting fate; to a Jewish military sargeant conflicted about how to fairly treat Jewish members of his military battalion.One can almost taste the honesty, it is so thick. That is what I love about Roth. He has no agenda other than the accurate descriptions of humanity, which in his experiences happen to be mostly Jewish, in all its failings, idiosyncrasies and conflict.I eagerly await the next installment in my Roth-provided education."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Roth at all, and when discussing him, I always seem to forget that he wrote these stories. It really does seem like the work of a different author; a brighter, more clever and inventive one; namely, younger. Maybe the mold of cynicism just set around him at a certain point as he aged, in which case Goodbye, Colombus stands as his first and last good work.First of all, the writing is first-rate modern American, a light but not overly breezy style, something like Bellow. Especially in the title story, the subtle humor is very effective, and he has a Salingerian gift for making the last sentence of a paragraph resonate. The themes, also, that continue throughout the stories are well-developed and intriguing; in 'Defender of the Faith,' he shows how a very convincing sociopath takes advantage of his Jewish identity and uses it as a weapon; in a story the title of which I can't remember, a young boy rebels against the oppressive Jewish instruction of his elders; then, later, in 'Eli the Fanatic,' Roth shows a man discovering solace in the stark rituals of traditional Judaism. The issue is examined from many angles. 'Epstein' is more suggestive of his later work and somehwat distasteful, very bleak, but a convincing portrait of an aging and frustrated Jewish man. 'You can't tell a man by the song he sings' is lighter and has little relation to the theme of Judaism, in case you were beginning to think Roth couldn't write about anything else.The title story is easily the best; the rest are just accesories. While the romance which it depicts never really seems justified (what does she see in him to begin with?), the writing is superlative and the characters interesting, and the semitragic conclusion more moving than it really should be. In this story, Roth displays a delicacy which is foremost among the things he inexplicably loses later on; he seems to like these characters, even the spoiled and decadent family, and stops to linger on minor details with a real zest for description.Reading these stories made me think I had judged Roth too quickly after reading only two of his books; I read another, and was disappointed again. Stick to this one."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"From the first quarter of the first story:The darker it got the more savagely did Brenda msh the net ...Though it w3s summer now nnd I was out of college three years, it w3s not hard for me ...The page he had been looking at showed an 81/212 x 11 print... twinkled in his boyish eves Poor little Tulie (eves should be eyes, no period, Tulie for Julie)yamdkah (not yamulkah)In the entire house I had'nt seen one picture of Mr. Patimkin.incongrosly (misspelled)Believe me, I could on like this all day -- there were hundreds of mistakes like these.

Terrible."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I find Philip Roth's debut novella, Goodbye, Columbus, to be much more enjoyable than his more famous work, Portnoy's Complaint. For one thing, Columbus is much shorter - it gets to the point. It is not endlessly repetitive, the way Portnoy is - nor is Roth as full of himself in this more modest work.Goodbye, Columbus has all the heart that Portnoy's Complaint lacks. It is the proverbial \\"coming of age\\" story of Neil Klugman. Neil is the Philip Roth stand-in - like Roth, he is a poor Jewish boy from Newark. He has his first great love affair with Brenda Patimkin - a rich girl from Short Hills. Brenda is all he could ever want in a woman, so everything should be perfect...right? The reader may guess at the stops along the way, but predictability isn't really the issue - it's the journey that matters.I found the short stories in this collection less appealing. They are all on the same theme: the aversion Roth feels towards Jewish-American culture, while being a Jewish-American. This is one of the central themes in his novels as well, but his short stories are not able to support this theme as well as the other diversions that make his novels enjoyable. As such, the short stories are one-trick-ponies, and I found them tiring. Perhaps this is the reason that Roth is known as a novelist and not a short-story writer. However, the book is worth purchasing for the novella alone."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"After I recently heard a piece about Roth on the radio I decided to learn more about him and read one of his books. After looking at the long listing of works he's written and literary awards won, it seemed easiest to just go with the first book he wrote, of which it's been said is a 'masterpiece'.Having written this first book while still in his 20s, it may be safe to presume he was at the latter end of his formative years. Therefore, it seems this book of short(er) stories must be strongly reflective of Roth's Jewish upbringing, as nearly each story is centered in some fashion around the Northern New Jersey Jewish community of the 1950s. Yet, despite that seemingly narrow setting and context, each of the stories is unique in its own right. Nearly every story presents to the reader a conflict of some type, be it in love, family, religion, community, self, morality, ethics, or something else along those lines. These are not intense stories of suspense or mystery which keep the (or this) reader turning the pages with anticipation, but the conflict presented in each story coupled with what I think is excellent overall style and great characters make for good reading.So, while in the end I wasn't enthralled with this book quite enough to give it five stars, I must say that I so much enjoyed Roth's style that I definitely will take a closer look at his other works, find some that look like good stories, and read him again."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Reminded me a bit of 'Sterile Cuckoo'.

Yeah, we've all heard this at one point or another (at least those of you taking and wasting time to read a review of one of his books). This was Mr. Roth's first published work, a short novel and five short stories that forced us to realize this man had arrived violently on the scene as a powerful literary force. Let's talk about the stories in this collection:&quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; is, honestly, without the standard hyperbole so many people slab into reviews such as this, one of the best novels I have ever read. It was written by a twenty-five year old man who was only going to get better (as his work from the mid-1980s to the present firmly establishes) yet here we have the wisdom of our great American gods. It is a beautiful story, funny and painful and filled with truths anyone in those recent post-college, still-not-finding-one's self perspective could learn and grow from. I love this story, and it is filled with agonizing self-analytical material that shows who it is we are dealing with, the intellect and the passion, the savagry and the wit. There are not too many single stories of American authors I could recommend more highly than this book, in particular the five page sequence from which this story gets its title. It is haunting and true, one of the rare glories of English in narrative form. If for nothing else, get this book to read this lovely novella. It is, profoundly, a masterpiece (not a term I use lightly either, being the bitter cynic I am--check out other reviews I've written--I can get rather mean)&gt;Among the other stories, the most celebrated is &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;, and for good reason. This is another gorgeously written tale about self-discovery and the agony of those questions all beginning with 'Why?' Here is a story questioning faith, questioning the idea of God or a higher power that has been transformed into such a makeshift mythology by all the varying faiths, why bother, it asks, what is the point and is it real and who are we and why are we here and why why why why why? This is a great story.Sadly, this collection is begun with the two tales I have so widely praised. The remaining stories are good--very good, in fact, but following up &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and &quot;Conversion of the Jews&quot;, something is lost as they are unable (quite understandably--what 25 year old author is going to maintain such sustained greatness? It took Roth 27 years to return to this passion in &quot;The Counterlife&quot;, and then he expanded from there, getting better and better progressively, and never looking back)to keep up the fascination. Now this is not to say there is anything wrong with these other stories. Had they been all there was in this collection I would have looked back with nodding approval and said, &quot;Hey, this guy is going somewhere.&quot; But they are not the first two stories and are almost awkwardly placed as an aftermath of a developing great author. Get this book urgently, and read them all. Just don't allow yourself to be soured by the slightly lesser material following the first two masterworks."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Goodbye, Columbus is a coming of age story, a summer romance between a poor boy and a wealthy girl. Many themes that were to show up in much more detail in his later works are presented in embryonic form in this novella, his first major work. Being Jewish in America, sex, class boundaries, the American Way: All Roth subjects, all handled with intelligence and compassion.Neil is the typical poor Jewish boy enamoured with Brenda, the classy, self-assured, rich girl. He shows a rare spark of confidence when he calls her for a date after first meeting her at a swimming pool, when she accepts and they meet, he finds that he really doesn't know what to do from there. But, they bumble through the beginnings of a relationship, mutually attracted physically, diametrically opposed socially. Neil has a few 'poor' ideas and thoughts that Brenda cannot relate to, while she accepts such luxuries as a maid or 'getting her nose fixed' with such ease and complacency that we - and Neil - are amazed. Over the summer, their relationship develops further, with the typical ups and downs of love colouring the journey.Neil is the 'I' character of the story, and it is through his point of view that we watch the story unfold. However, even though the story is in first person, there is never much of his personality revealed through contemplative thought or reflection. Instead, we learn who he is from the way he interacts with Brenda and others, and from the way he studies the events in which he is involved. By the end of the novella, we (mostly) understand his motives and ideas, and though, admittedly, it is a little difficult to imagine Neil existing outside the scope of the novel, that actually plays into the theme of the story. Neil is searching for meaning, for a reason to keep on existing, and he considers that in Brenda, he has found it. Whether this is true or not becomes a large focus in the novel, particularly when, later on, she repeatedly reveals to him that she is in fact her own person, with her own ideas, and that sometimes they won't mesh with his.Brenda, on the other hand, remains a complete mystery to both the reader and Neil. Because we are never allowed to see her thoughts, and because her and Neil have such a different social background, she is someone who we try to understand, but inevitably fail. At times, Neil will say or do something and she will become upset, or tender, or both, and Neil will be so confused that he simply accepts. This can be frustrating for the reader, because Brenda is an appealing character, and it would be nice for him to have the gumption to search deeper within her for meaning and thought, but unfortunately he rarely does. Interestingly, this doesn't come off so much as a failing on Roth's part as an author, but Neil's as a character.As stated above, the typical themes and ideas that Roth was to develop more fully in his later works are present here. There is the same easy insight into the mundane reality of life, and the same simple joy in, say, eating a piece of fruit or swimming in a pool. Goodbye, Columbus is a story that focuses on one single idea, that being the summer romance between two people that could not have a relationship in any other situation, and it explores it in a remarkably fulfilling way. Admittedly, the very Jewish quality of the writing and ideas may not be as identifiable for a non-Jewish person, but speaking as a man of no faith, I didn't find it to be all that much of a problem. Also, the casual racism towards African-Americans may be off-putting, but again, it didn't upset the flow of the novel.To conclude, what Roth has done here is to introduce himself as an author, and for a twenty-six year old, it is an impressive introduction. Having read other works of his, I would recommend it as a good starting point. If you like Goodbye, Columbus - and I am quite certain everyone would - then you will love his later works. If not, not. And at only 140 pages, it is worth everyone's time to check out."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Goodbye, Columbus is the story of Neil Klugman from poor Newark and Brenda Patimkin from an upper-crust family in Short Hills and their relationship over a summer. Neil relates the story of his love for the beautiful Brenda, a love in which the two share little in common. He presents his hopes and dreams and his ultimate realizations about the state of the world and about himself. The novella is ultimately a beautiful, complex coming-of-age story which it seems everyone goes through.Goodbye, Columbus is one of the best books I have read. It was so realistic and easy to relate to. I think that I have had a relationship similar to every one related in the novel. There are so many great insights to be found here. The novella isn't a difficult read, but one should definitely be aware of a lot of the symbols (such as the title, the fruit, the lions, and the uncle at the wedding) to glean the most from it. I will also say a word about the short stories. All of them, particularly &quot;The Conversion of the Jews,&quot; were wonderful. They alone would make the book worth five stars; they just seem to get forgotten because of the masterpiece the opening novella is."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"In Goodbye, Columbus, Philip Roth weaves a tale about the assimilation of the American Jew which reached its height in the 1950's. As outward displays of anti-semitism began to decrease, the Jewish community faced a moral crisis. How much of our heritage need we or should we retain in this &quot;golden land&quot;.The message of Philip Roth in all of his works, but especially his inaugural one, is that American Jews have payed a price for acceptance. They have traded in their ghetto mentality for a ticket to the American Dream. While many would welcome such a transformation, Roth unabashedly condemns it.In the character of Brenda Patimkin, we are presented with the archtypical &quot;Jewish American Princess&quot; materialistic yet vulnerable. Neil Klugman is exactly the opposite, the symbol of the &quot;old-world&quot; Jew who lives with his Aunt and Uncle in the city. Despite their differences Brenda and Neil eventually fall in love only to discover that their inner attitudes are the diametric opposites to their outward characteristics. It is Brenda who is concerned in a old fashioned sense about what her parents think of her pre-marital affair.In Goodbye, Columbus Roth describes the foibles and makeup of the Jewish American community which, like Newark, was coming apart at the seams in the middle of the twentieth century.H.Brookman-Elizabeth, New Jersey"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"The first five chapters of Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus follow his protagonist Neil Klugman through a romanticized post college summer. Roth introduces this straightforward prose with a sentence that does not waste anytime, \\"The first time I saw Brenda\\"(p 3). This sentence draws the reader quickly into a book that does not spend pages on exposition, rather Roth starts out with action and fills in any gaps as they arise. This writing style is beautiful to read, and perfectly matches the quick, to the point feeling of a summertime romance. The story, like the prose, is not over packed. It begins, as stated, with the first time Neil meets Brenda Patimkin. The feeling of young love jumps off the first page, when Neil watches Brenda walk away, \\"She caught the bottom of her suit between thumb and index finger and flicked what flesh had been showing back where it belonged. My blood jumped\\" (p 3). And the reader, along with Neil, is hooked on Brenda from the beginning. Roth is careful to make the feelings in the book apparent, from the first we feel as though we are about to embark on a summer of relaxation and love. But Roth's love is not married couple adult love; it is love like the cashier in Updike's A &amp;P. It is love at first sight. It is pretty girl by the pool kind of love. This feeling of Neil's love for Brenda is only made stronger by Roth's evocation of summer. The dominant feeling in the book though, is lust. Neil begins his relationship with Brenda after watching her at the pool, and after that he is always bringing sex to the foreground of he book. The description of Neil and Brenda's escapade in the pool shows Neil's youthful obsession with the female body, \\"Her breasts swam towards me like two pink-nosed fish and she let me hold them\\"(p 17). It does not end there; after he ate dinner with Brenda's family he sat at his desk in the library and, \\"watched the hot high-breasted teen-age girls walk twitchingly up the wide flight of marble stairs\\"(p 32). And he describes his lust for other women as \\"academic and time passing\\" showing that may not feel anything towards the girls that walk by him, but that should not stop him from thinking about them (p 32). The constant remembrance of sex in the novel is the most effective method Roth uses of getting his mood across. Without it the spirit of summer, young love, and adventure would be gone. Neil and Brenda's relationship would be dull and flat; the afternoons at the library would be spent solely on thinking about work, and story would be deflated. Roth did not, however, write an erotic book that talks only about sex. He does recognize what a key role sex, lust, and love play in the lives of his twenty-year-old characters. He uses it as a framework for which to place the deeper, less common story."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"The book's brilliant.Here's one thing that's not in the book that perhaps sheds some light on understanding the title: Across the street from the Newark Library, where the lead character works, is a park containing a statue of Christopher Columbus.After reading this book many years ago, I was puzzled by the title. The \\"Columbus record\\" scenes to which the title refers did not seem as climactic and important to be highlighted. The Columbus record belongs to a second tier character, and yes, while the scene undergirds themes of coming of age and loss, the scene just didn't seem to be that important. But when you tie that coming-of-age theme to the statue of the explorer across from the lead character's workplace, where Neil no doubt ate lunch regularly, then you realize that Goodbye, Columbus, is Philip Roth's Goodbye to Berlin.(I refer especially to the last scene in Berlin, in which all the characters in Isherwood's novel are having a picnic...no big deal, until you realize they are Jews and homosexuals and intellectuals and everyone else who, if they fail to get out, will be doomed shortly by the Third Reich. And all of it is left unsaid, the history is left to comment on the work on its own.)In Columbus, the stakes are lower but analogous. The lead character is going to leave Newark ... he still works there, but he's going to say goodbye to that statue across the street, by extention the city. It's all unsaid but after the lead character gets out of Newark, the construction of I-78 will mean the beautiful neighborhood where Neil and his family lived will be torn apart; after that, Newark faces a particularly corrupt administration that starts the flight of businesses and sets the stage for the three days of devastating riots in 1967 (the ruins of which stood for more than 20 years) and the flight of half the population from the city.Goodbye to Columbus was written while the forces that destroyed Newark were inchoate, but it only means that in this case, Roth was prescient."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Philip Roth obviously doesn't believe in stretching his imagination too much - the main story here and most of the supporting shorter stories revolve around Jewish boys growing up around Newark, New Jersey. His real strength however lies in his ability to take these characters and describe and examine what makes them tick, and imbue them with just enough personal identity to distinguish them from each other and allow them to sink into our consciousness.\\"Goodbye Columbus\\" the story is a touching tale of a summer romance between two individuals from very different social circles. There isn't much plot, not very much happens and the moral dilemma that ultimately shapes the fate of the relationship is a bit hard to relate to in these promiscuous times. Roth doesn't spend much time on that aspect of the plot, presuming perhaps that his contemporary reader would be only too familiar with the portrayed dilemma. Reading it at the start of the 21st century I feel unable to fully empathize with the protagonists' situation. However the prose is well observed, the situations and dialogue are witty and amusing and although the ending is a bit weak, I feel the beauty of the writing transcends generational barriers.The short stories are more pointed, and pithier, and perhaps make for better reading. As in Roth's other work, the characters are mostly very Jewish, and many revolve around particularly Jewish themes, feelings and situations. However I still found myself well able to identify with the narrators, despite being handicapped by my obvious goyishness."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"The great brilliance and talent of Philip Roth announce themselves to the world in this first book. Much of what Roth would be later admired for is present in this work. A remarkable capacity for creating memorable characters, a tremendous liveliness and humor in language, a somewhat sarcastic view of American reality mixed up with a deeply romantic and idealistic one, fervent sexual interest. There is also in these works the kind of criticism of his home- team, the American Jewish family which would make him anathema to certain leading figures of the Jewish literary ( Irving Howe) and cultural establishment. The major piece of writing , the novella ' Goodbye Columbus' seems like it is the heir apparent to ' The Great Gatsby'. There is a mastery of tone , precociously mature. That tone and that control will lead to the less successful line in Roth's writing, in which the narrator ( When She was Good) and the writer appear to be seeking entrance to the cathedral of Jamesian Anglo- American literature. This novella has many skilled and interesting pieces of writing excellently evokes the world of Jewish American suburbia its business and family worlds. The love affair between Neil and Brenda Patinkin has a certain unsatisfactory quality especially in his ungenerous portrait of Brenda. The scene with the little black boy in the library fascinated by the works of Gaugin may be sentimental but is quite moving. As for the stories they too have a brilliance, and they also have that criticism of middle - class Jewish piety which Roth will be lambasted for .These are very good pieces of writing and would stand well on their own. But when Roth wrote ' Portnoy's Complaint ' he changed the way his previous work would be seen .And all would be understand as simply preliminary to that outrageous work of true literary genius. This is a fine book, but that is a great one."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Sadly, the kindle edition is replete with typos - seemingly from an un-proofread OCR translation. A truly great book, but completely unreadable. Too bad Roth's publisher isn't available on the itunes store..."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"Not many writers had such a great debut as Philip Roth with his \`Goodbye, Columbus'. His harshest critics may say he has had ups and downs in his career, but no one can say that his first book is not superb --even those who don't like it. Crafting with a short novella, Roth was able to display all his qualities that he would develop later on with his books.\`Columbus' is nothing more than the simple story of a summertime love. A Jewish boy named Neil meets a girl, who belongs to an upper level in society, they fall in love, and, above everything, have to deal with their social difference. But the way Roth writer is so simply profound and beautiful, that it is impossible no to be touched by this little masterpiece.The characters are so well developed, that the more one reads the more compelling the story becomes. Not failing to mention such a fresh sense of humor that makes this novella very funny. This same quality appears in the other five short stories gathered in this Vintage edition.One may complain that Roth has not much creativity, writing about only one subject: the young Jewish man in the late 50's. But that is not really true. His stories are similar not because of the lack of imagination, but because the writer cares to focus his attention in this subject. And, although, it seems a limited issue at first, with his words it becomes easily universal, because above all the stories concern on the human condition.Among the stories, it is possible to find one the finest Roth's short texts: \`Defender of the faith'. The surreality of the proximity of the war and the dispute between the two main characters somehow reminds the tour de force present in the movies made by Amos Gitai. The absurd of the situation, and the characters focusing on another --maybe smaller-- issue are funny, when we don't think of the imminent situation.One doesn't have to look any further to find hints of the themes and characters that would be present in further works. The daughter in \`Epstein' is somehow a draft of the daughter who would appear much more developed in his novel \`American Pastoral'.All in all, \`Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories' is a good introduction for those curious to get into Roth's universe, and, it is a fundamental reading for the ones who like his books."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I reread Goodbye Columbus, which I had read in 1970! This was Philip Roth's first novel, starting off his long (and continuing to this day) career of quirky, bold, controversial novels. Goodbye Columbus was really a novella, and somewhat autobiographical (in time and place at least). It isn't a book for everyone, but I loved it! Neil Krugman, lower middle class Jewish young man, living in Newark with his old school aunt and uncle in the late 1950's meets Brenda Patimpkin, original Jewish American Princess (before the term was used, but clearly at a time when the newly wealthy Jews were leaving the Jewish \\"ghetto's\\" of NY and Newark and heading to Short Hills, Milburn and Livingston, NJ, where even today they live in material splendor. Brenda and her parents, brother and little sister Julie (quite a brat) live in Short Hills where with their surgically altered little noses, they are fed lovely meals by their housekeeper, Carlotta, and they play tennis and swim at their ritzy club which is where Brenda and Neil meet one day when she is home from Radcliffe for summer vacation. She asks him to hold her glasses. He does, and from there a romance builds. Neil spends many weeks at the Patimpkin home, staying there for a 2 week vacation and spending his nights sneaking across the hall into the waiting Brenda's arms. This was risque in 1957. It happened, of course, but it wasn't talked about and people were far more furtive than Brenda and Neil. He encourages her to be fitted for a diaphragm and she is horrified. And here is where, only people of a certain age would know the reference to Margaret Sanger, Neil advises Brenda to go to the Margaret Sanger offices in NYC. I only knew what it was because I remember my Grandmother telling me that when she was a young married woman no one but married women could get such birth control, but that Margaret Sanger had an institute where wealthy married women could go for birth control! Most people reading this novel would not know this. Funny the things a book can bring back to your memory 40+ years after a conversation with a beloved, long dead grandmother! Brenda heads to NYC but feels she must pretend to be married!!!! There is a delightful scene as she exits the Margaret Sanger office, a scene which played out in my head in Ali McGraw's voice as I remembered her so well from the movie based on the book, a movie I saw at age 15 while traveling with a theatre camp. (I would NOT want a 15 yr. old to see the movie, rated R, even now!)Roth's observations are keen. When he heads back to his home in Newark to see his aunt and uncle he wonders about the city, which had been so fine at one time. Jews with money left, the town was being filled with black people en masse, and he ponders whether, they too, will flee one day, but he concludes that no, he cannot imagine any other group filling it's streets. I found that so interesting as I look at Newark's demographics today. Roth, via Neil Klugman, is mocking the identity loss of ethnic Jews, fixing bent noses, living in over abundant splendor and looking down on the middle class, even the Jewish middle class. Even today we see people like this in their McMansions (doesn't matter their ethnicity or religion). These are the people who drive flashy cars and have to make known their wealth, even though no one is really impressed except themselves.The romance of Brenda and Neil has it's twists and roadblocks. In the end there is a controversy I have never forgotten, but won't ruin for you. Did she or did she NOT do the thing she did on purpose? People discussed this for years (in schools, among friends, and after the movie). It's SUCH a good question!!!!!Roth was only 25 when he penned this brilliant first novel. His observations are so astute for one so young. His writing is spare (unlike mine!) and allows the reader to easily envision his story playing out before his eyes. My daughter has chosen to read Goodbye Columbus for an honors research paper (jr. year in h.s.) and I am concerned that it is too sexy for her. As a teenager, I loved it, but as a mother I am freaking out! I am glad I will be able to explain to her the way society was in the late 50's, just beginning to let go of repression and allowing the sexual revolution and the free love of the 60's to become the new way of life for so many. I will be able to explain the reference to Margaret Sanger. She has been to Short Hills, so she will have some reference in her mind as to where the Patimpkin's lived and played their beautiful-on-the-outside but disfunctional lives.Philip Roth is one of the greats! He will be read for generations to come, liek Fitgerald and Hemingway. Perhaps he will be remembered for being one of the first to write about birth control in a novel.I am trying to get my hands on a copy of the dvd, but unless I am willing to pay $80, there are none. Richard Benjamin and Ali McGraw were so perfectly cast! The music plays in my head, their youth and charm flash across the screen. Rereading the book was a delight!!!!!"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I read this in college many years ago and came back to it to see if held the old magic. I am happy to say that it does. Roth captures so much of modern suburban life, circa mid-century - the flight from the city to the suburbs, the angst of young love, and finding the authentic identity, in a warm and humorous way that stands the test of time. Goodbye Columbus is a rare book that is nearly word-perfect,"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"This was the first volume I read by Philip Roth, and for now the only one, and I have to say I was not as impressed as I had been led to believe. Don't get me wrong, it was by no means bad, but it didn't blow my mind. The subject of the title story didn't interest me too much, it was the style that kept me going and I eventually liked it (the first pages failed to capture my interest).I liked the short stories better, for the most part.When it comes to East Coast Jewish authors, I far prefer JD Salinger over Philip Roth (although I prefer Salinger over almost every author there is). I'll say it's an interesting insight into the Jewish community although not to the extent that it becomes some anthropoligical volume.I was just nonplussed, mostly. It's always a difficult thing to be nonplussed by renouned classics that everyone seems to love and worship.Goodbye, Columbus is an efficiently written, witty, and insightful volume, although, to me, it doesn't have the magic that I would expect from a classic. For this reason, I'm very unsure that I'll ever read another Roth book again (and that's not because I disliked Roth \\"so much\\", but simply because I have tons on my reading list already), although if you feel like suggesting another, better, book by this author, I'm all ears."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"A fun re-read.

This book was one more step in the right direction.Philip Roth is one of America's most prolific and lauded contemporary authors, and most of his work is considered to be semi-autobiographical.This book, his first work, contains the novella, \\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" and five much shorter stories.In this collection, all of his protagonists are Jewish males. And, like nearly all of his works, the stories take place in New Jersey.\\"Goodbye, Columbus\\" is the story of a young man who is attracted to a red-headed athletic young woman that he sees at a country club. He pursues Brenda with the persistency of a man who has the confidence to have a beautiful woman but with the sarcastic tone that belies the chip on his shoulder for not quite measuring up.He sees everything with a smirk; his tone is belittling and condescending to cover his sense of not belonging in Brenda's suburban Jewish life.I am re-reading it again just to learn how Roth wrote that smirk.The other five stories are good. Almost like fables, my favorite one, \\"Conversion of the Jews\\", is startlingly profound, calling to mind questions I think that most of us have subliminally thought but were never able to say.If you are interested in dipping your toe into some more \\"literary\\" work, this book is extremely easy to read and I found the stories to be quite moving."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Columbus,: And five short stories (Meridian fiction)","review":"I bought this book for school but had previously viewed the movie.

For Roth fans, the real treat here is seeing the author's work as a young man. If you are like me and have read all of his books from the 1990s, you probably have an image in your mind of an author in his 60s. His writing always comes across as somewhat autobiographical, and most of the main characters in his books over the past ten years have been Jewish men entering their golden years. Because of this, I was a bit surprised to read a book of his in which the main characters are almost all young Jewish men. This just reinforces the notion that Roth has always tried to stick with what he knows, and that his writing stems more from his experience than from his creativity. In my mind he's the best writer out there."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],S={key:0},j={key:1};function B(n,e,s,u,r,i){const y=w("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",W,[(t(!0),a(g,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(y,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",S,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const F=c(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-248ce05d"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/50.md","filePath":"glossary/50.md"}'),q={name:"glossary/50.md"},E=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{R as __pageData,E as default};
