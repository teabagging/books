I am always happy to start one and sad to end one.Always plenty of action and adventure make the Dirk Pitt Adventures interesting from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I happily ripped through the Oregon Files and wanted more... so I thought I'd try Cussler's earlier Dirk Pitt series. This is the first Pitt Adventure I've read. I thoroughly enjoyed the simpler throw-back to a less complicated time. Unlike the one-legged, blond-haired, blue-eyed and complicated Latino- Juan Cabrillo, who relies on the stealthy high tech gadgetry on his state-of-the art vessel, Dirk Pitt is more like one of Captain America's army pals. So I found the Mediterranean Caper to be crisper, and cleaner- if somewhat slower. But it still maintained my interest from the first page until the very end. Some of the vivid- if somewhat stereotypical, characters in this book remind me of roles portrayed in the \\"The Love of Four Colonels,\\" a play by Peter Ustinov. I'm not sure which series I will end up liking the most, but I do know, I'm in all the way for the rest of the Dirk Pitt series! 4 Stars!"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"As always Clive Cussler is a great author who can captivate you. He is able to get you to build an mental image to live the story that he has written. Spell binding from start to finish. I would recommend his books to anyone."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Bought this for my Husband's new Kindle my daughter and I purchased for him for Valentines Day. He's a HUGH Cussler fan and I know he will enjoy this book as he has with the other Cussler novels."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I enjoy adventure novels and this book fulfills that desire. It was fast paced, detailed so as to allow the reader to envision the scenes. It had the twists and turns in the plot that thrills the heart of the reader."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This is by far the worst of the Dirk Pitt novels, I have read many of them and in my opinion this was almost as though an undersexed high school student had written it. Don't bother buying it if you have read other cussler novels this one will surely disapoint you."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book, my first by Clive Cussler. Dirk Pitt, the main character and lead for several other Cussler books, is a fun protagonist and certainly an engaging character. Mainly because of Pitt's likability, I am looking forward to checking out more of Cussler's works.Now, after all that, why only 3 stars? Well, quite simply, it just wasn't a great book, but on the other hand, it met my expectations. The Mediteranean Caper is a fun adventure story, but with a plot maybe a little too fantastic. The book starts off with a bang, but even that bang seems a little forced and unbelievable. And as the story progresses, the elements of realism get left in the dust. Not to mention, he spends so much time building up one character, and then super-casually reveals this huge twist that turns out to mean nothing to the story.I am absolutely not one who doesn't like to suspend belief when reading books or watching movies. James Bond is my favorite fictional character ever, so I am obviously a huge fan of stories that are \\"unbelievable.\\" But when I read Ian Fleming's books, I can appreciate that he is an expert writer. Never did I get that sense with Cussler, and hence it is a three-star book. It served as a great introduction to Cussler's books, but it isn't the same as Fleming, or the adventure novels of Alistair McLean."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Released only once in 1995, this book contains the first two published Dirk Pitt adventures. A limited number of this omnibus were printed then, making it very sought after today. Collectors will love this publication, as well as anyone who's wondered how it all started with Pitt and NUMA. \\"Iceberg\\" is my favorite of the two because the bad guys are eventually apprehended during a daring battle in The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland. Cussler gave readers an entertaining backstage look at the Magic Kingdom-something the Walt Disney Company did not appreciate much. A number of copies of this book are available here on Amazon and elsewhere on the Internet. It's worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"A novel filled with adventure, excitement, and deeds of daring do, taking place sometime during the 20th century, in and around the Mediterranean. The story is described in the third person following dashing hero Dirk Pitt and loyal friend, Al Giordino as well as following the diabolical villains. It is a story filled with danger and action combined with amazing descriptions. Recommended age 14 and up for innuendoes and descriptions of violent events.This novel is not a simple read, but it is not cut and dry either. Cussler is and amazing author who has a gift for expressing description and emotion. Even though the story is told in third person, as a reader you get a real feel for the characters and become amerced in the story. The story is mostly centered on the charming Dirk Pitt, an unusual hero who always manages to land on his 1feet. Pitt is not a common hero, his features are attractive, but not quite movie star quality so he relies on his wit and people skills to help him \`get in the door' so to speak. From the first three pages I was lost in this book. Cussler does an amazing job setting up descriptions to make the reader feel like they are in those places and know those people. The quote \\"his large brown hands moved efficiently, pulling back on the control column and the plane aimed its flat snout at the sun\\", is a taste at some of the imagery and description used. I spent a majority of this book wanting to be there, wanting to be in the action. Cussler is truly a gifted writer who embraces his spirit of adventure."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Cussler just doesn't know how to disappoint his readers. If he has as much fun writing his books as I do reading them he must be in a perpetual good mood. This early novel of Pitt's adventures takes place (guess where?) in Europe on an island and it isn't long before Pitt, the human magnet for trouble stumbles upon quite an interesting situation. From getting strafed by an old bi-plane to finding an underground cavern complete with a submarine to getting lost in a maze and attacked by vicious dogs Cussler has given us a meaty tale to swallow, but one we are glad to digest because he makes us enjoy the ride. As usual good prevails and evil is punished, Pitt-style, and all in all this early outing for Dirk is as fun as almost anything in the Cussler library of adventure. Pick it up, climb aboard and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This is my second Dirk Pitt book. This was a quick read with lots of action. As another person mentioned, you just don't go around slapping strangers and then make love to them in a matter of minutes. The ending was quick too. Pitt explains how he solved the mystery and the reader has to wonder when did he have the time to do all that?I have a question about the teaser so if you haven't read the book yet, turn away. :)How did Pitt capture the Teaser? He mentions oh by the way look behind this certain rock down below and you will find a surprise. It seems there is nothing that Pitt can't do. What is he going to do next, Raise the Titanic? ;)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"In Australia this was titled Mayday!!. This is the book that got me hooked on Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino. From the opening scene of Dirk engaging in battle with a WW1 aircraft to the final battle in an underground cavern it kept me enthralled enough to re read the book (at last count) ten times. I found the villans in this book about the best of all Cussler books. As is always the case the geography, scientific and mechanical information to be spot on. I found out that Al is missing a finger on his right hand and that Dirk was a gentler man in previous years. Mayday captured my imagination. (This book is still readily available in Australia)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"The Mediterranean Caper: Audio Cassette ReviewI have a confession to make. I originally purchased this audio cassette because I'm a fan of thereader, Bruce Greenwood. I have enjoyed Mr. Greenwood's work since &quot;St. Elsewhere.&quot; Whenhis most recent television series, &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; ended, I looked forward to the opportunity toexperience another one of his projects. I had no knowledge of Clive Cussler's work. Since I'musually not attracted to the detective genre, I didn't expect to receive much enjoyment from tnestory. Happily, I was wrong . Mr. Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitt, is a larger than lifesuperhero with romance and intrigue to spare. This isn't a criticism; if the popularity of a certainsecret agent is any indication, we like our heroes invincible. Mr. Cussler sets the stage with avery visual style of writing that forms word pictures for the reader. This coupled with the variedhost of characters, provides an expansive canvas for Bruce Greenwood's boundless talent forvoice and dialect. Mr. Greenwood can move from a British accent to a German accent and on toa woman's voice without a hitch. One is soon swept away by his magic and treated to a virtualtheater for the ears! (Being the avid Star Trek fan that I am, I can only hope that Simon &amp;Schuster will consider Mr. Greenwood for their Star Trek audio series.) The combined talents ofClive Cussler and Bruce Greenwood provide a powerful elixir for fun. I'm looking forward tofuture visits with Dirk Pitt.Rating 8Bonnie R.

This means that when I consider something worth getting into, I do it from the start, and I acquire everything related to it. In the case of fiction, I begin by reading an author's work chronologically. When I decided to get into Cussler, judging from generally good reviews and my fondness for thrillers, I started with his first book \\"Pacific Vortex!\\" and have just finished this one, \\"The Mediterranean Caper\\". I have come to realize rather quickly that Cussler could not have built his reputation with these early works, because they are quite dreadful. I'm hoping things get a lot better as I read through his subsequent efforts.This book is as bad as the one- and two-star reviews have made it out to be. But I read it with the same curiosity that one would watch a cheesy 'B' movie, and basically to witness the evolution of a great writer across the years.

Their only complaint against this book, is a scene where pitt basically tells a lady to move on with her life. Nothing wrong with that, should he have slapped her, no. But he was right in telling her that to waste all those grieving was destroying her, but of course none of that really matters. Since we know that she was really an agent, and trying to play Pitt. Since she didn't know if he was an assassin or not. Sent by her \\"Uncle\\", a former Nazi Ace who killed the real Bruno Von Till. Took his place, and now ran drugs, Interpol sent in an agent to pretend to be his niece. Pitt and Giordino must try to stop him. Pitt battling a viscious dog in the underground catacombs of Von Till's castle is scary enough. But Pitt does win in the end, and actually adds to his car collection. As the second book in the series, it's still abit rough. But it's not terrible by any means, you can actually see where Cussler started to settle on what makes Dirk Pitt. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This is the first in the Dirk Pitt series for Clive Cussler and it was interesting to see the early formation of the character.

She comes to her senses, and within minutes they're making love on the beach.

They thought it was extinct. Someone is sabotaging things. Dirk Pitt is assigned to help them. Some bad guys are nearby doing bad things.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I enjoyed the Lee Child books about Jack Reacher, and I thought this author might be similar. Although I've compared Jack to a comic book hero, I find Dirk is much more of a comic book hero than Jack. Dirk is a hero adventurer whose life is often in danger, but he always survives and outwits the bad guys. I've now read two Dirk Pitt books. I'm done. He just doesn't do it for me. I'm not sure why. Jack Reacher fascinates and entertains me but Dirk doesn't. The Dirk stories feel like action-adventure movies, not the kind of depth that I normally get from books. Maybe because the characters and motivations aren't developed enough for me? I'm not sure.DATA:Story length: 372 pages. Swearing language: moderate, including religious swear words.

She rewards him by letting him have sex with her on the beach. Is that how its done...I need to head out to local beaches and see how this approach goes.

Seriously, Mediterranean Caper is one of the most poorly written and contrived books I have ever read. I've seen Johnny Quest cartoon episodes that had much more plot and sophistication.Save your money. Another one-star review here from Paul Treleaven describes in great detail the shortcomings of this book that I agree with wholeheartedly (good observations, Paul). When Dirk starts slapping the lady on the beach around, and she still wants to be intimate with him, well, that strains credulity. The Dirk Pitt character is really a jerk in this book - he hits women, beats up chauffeurs, screams obscenities at his superiors, and generally behaves like a gluteus maximus.Cussler has done much better than this. I highly recommend one of his later novels (The Chase) that ditch the Dirk character (maybe his name should be changed to Dick)."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"While I found this to be an ok story, it is definately dated in the author's/main character's attitude towards women. I know it was written a long time ago, but I still find Pitt's actions towards women mildy offensive. He is like the uber manly character of most adolescent fantasies i.e strong male character dragging a women towards his cave by the hair. anyway, that being said, the story isn't bad, but at the same time very corny/cliqued.

With this in mind I thought I'd start at the beginning (which is really Pacific Vortex, as it was written before \`The Mediterranean Caper' - or \`Mayday!' as it's called in Australia - was published).However, while I won't comment on the literary merits of Pacific Vortex (think an utterly dumbed down James Bond - and that's really dumb), it was supremely advanced over the stilted dialog and so-called machismo of the Mediterranean Caper. In fact, I wasn't even able to get past 35 pages of this truly awful example of writing.And why is that, you ask?Let's look at the following text taken from the book. To put you in the scene our \`hero' Dirk Pitt has gone down to the beach one early morning. While there a beautiful young woman stumbles across him. Naturally they talk and she reveals how her beloved husband was killed in a car crash eight and a half years previously:&lt;and let's now read the literary brilliance of Clive Cussler:>\`It's been eight and a half years now,' she replied in a whisper.Pitt felt dazed. Then anger set in. What a waste, he thought. What a rotten waste for a beautiful woman like her to grieve over a dead man for nearly nine years. The more he thought about it the angrier he became. He could see tears welling in her eyes as she lost herself in the remembrance, and the sight sickened him. He reached over and gave her a hard backhand slap across the face.Her eyes jerked wide, and her whole body tensed from the sharp blow. It was as if she was struck by a bullet. \`Why did you strike me?' she gasped.\`Because you needed it, needed it badly,' he snapped. \`That torch you carry around is as worn out as an overcoat. I'm surprised someone hasn't taken you over a knee and spanked it off. So your husband was dashing. So what? He's dead and buried, and mourning over him for all these years won't resurrect him from the grave. Lock away his memory somewhere and forget him. You're a beautiful woman - you don't belong chained to a coffin full of bones. You belong to every man who turns and admires you.' Pitt could see his words were penetrating her weak defences. \`Now you think about it. It's your life. Don't throw it away and play \\"Camille\\" until you're withered and grey.'Her face was distraught in the morning sun, and her breath came in sobs. Pitt let her cry for a long time. When she finally raised her head and turned it towards him, he could see that her cheeks were streaked with tears, mixed with tiny grains of sand, clinging to the wetness. She looked up at him, and he caught the gleam in her eyes. They were soft and scared-looking, like a little girl's. He lifted her in his arms and kissed her. Her lips were warm and moist.\`When was the last time you had a man?' he whispered.\`Not since...' Her voice trailed away.Pitt took her as the long shadows of the rocks crept upward over the beach, shielding their bodies from the sun.&lt;and thank you Clive>'Why did you strike me?'Personally, I can think of several other things I would've said in that situation, such as: 'Help', 'Police' and 'Rape'.I can only hope that in the intervening 3 decades since those words were written that Clive's attitudes to women and what constitutes a \`hero' are a bit less pathetic. Here's a fragile woman who is physically and verbally attacked by our 'hero', whose eyes are then equated with looking \`soft and scared-looking, like a little girl's' (well, whatever gets you going Dirk). Naturally Dirk Pitt then has sex (I won't say she does, she's just - in my mind - been raped) and she's ever so grateful and invites him back to meet her family, etc. etc.When I read that section I honestly thought, no, I must've missed something. There's no way that just happened.At that precise moment I found I could not read on.What sort of hero is this? Is this how a \`man's-man' is meant to behave? Is this, as other reviewers have said of this book, 'fun'?I mean, was this sort of garbage ever seen as okay, even in the early 1970's? I can understand a writer having their hero as a clich&eacute;d \`man' that all other men envy, etc, but what Dirk Pitt does in that scene is not something any \`man' or \`hero' would do.Sorry, Clive, because of that one scene I won't be reading any more of your books. I've already wasted my money on this one and the ridiculously plotted Pacific Vortex. I've already been burnt twice.There's too many good adventure stories out there, with much better writing and plot, and with character's that aren't throwbacks to some outdated era for anyone to be bothered with this infantile slush."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I'm always game to check out a good thriller, and never having read Cussler, thought it was time to sample one of his early books. Originally published in 1973, this is the second in his \\"Dirk Pitt\\" series -- and I have to say, it is truly awful. Probably the best way to characterize it is as a really poor imitation of the James Bond films (not the books): indestructible manly hero, sex on the beach with willing beauty, outrageously silly plot, secret submarine base, and worst of all, the villain who explains everything to the hero instead of killing him.Set in the early '70s, the book starts with some zany promise, as a German WWI biplane attacks an (fictional) American airbase on Thasos, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, about 75-100 miles east of Thessaloniki. The biplane efficiently destroys a bunch of F-105 Starfire Jets and C-133 transporters, without any response. (Apparently USAF bases of the time had no antiaircraft batteries. And the key to evading USAF radar is to use vintage aircraft -- so beware a North Korean strike force of Sopwith Camels!) Fortunately, Pitt happens to be flying a Catalina flying boat near the base at the same, and with the trusty aim of his rifle-totin' sturdy sidekick, manages to drive the biplane off. Pitt's been called in to investigate a series of strange accidents aboard a nearby scientific research vessel belonging the (also fictitious) National Underwater Marine Agency.Of course, the strafing and the accidents are related, and soon Pitt is knee-deep in a ridiculous plot. Apparently inspired by the 1971 film \\"The French Connection\\", Cussler soon has Pitt chasing after a massive heroin smuggling operation. But wait, there's more! One word: Nazis. I'll refrain from saying any more, other than the key to the smuggling plot that has baffled Interpol for decades is figured out in a few minutes by Pitt sketching on a beach. Unfortunately, it also will have been figured out on about page 20 by most semi-intelligent readers.The writing is just terrible, there's no other way to put it. Clunky descriptions, probably the worst dialogue I've read in several years, and cardboard characters. Plus, there's all kinds of stuff that Pitt does and figures out \\"off-camera\\", which are only revealed at the very end, which makes the reader feel rather cheated. I'll grant a writer one or two clever reveals in a story (the best I can think of is in Frederick Forsyth's \\"The Odessa File\\"), but these feel cheap. Many reviewers have commented on Pitt's rather old-fashioned take on women. However, in Cussler's defense, it was written more than thirty years ago, and it is in keeping with the genre. More importantly, with the regards to the scene where he slaps the beautiful woman and she proceeds to have sex with him, it's revealed at the very end that there is a good plot reason for her submission. It's still a laughably bad scene, but it does make some cockeyed sense within the scheme of the plot.Overall, I like thrillers and I like junky adventure stories, but even within those genre considerations, this is poor poor stuff. Maybe Cussler's gotten better over time, but I'm sure not going to waste any more of my time finding out."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"THE LOWDOWN: The first \\"real\\" Dirk Pitt adventure, it was published before Pacific Vortex, but chronologiclly it is a sequel. With a bit more swagger and style, and a (slightly) more down to Earth plot, the publishers found \\"Caper\\" to be more palatable, and had it published, while \\"Vortex\\" remained on the shelf for a few more years.THE PLOT: While investigating the sabotage of a NUMA research vessel, Dirk Pitt narrowly saves a Greek military outpost on a small Mediterranean island (Thasos) from being strafed by a WWI biplane (yes you read that right) which disappears as mysteriously as it arrived. Of course a mysterious beautiful girl gets involved with Pitt, and her uncle, a supremely evil Nazi war criminal, turns out to be behind both the sabotage and the attack, in an attempt to protect his lucrative smuggling outfit.THE PROS: It is not hard to see why the publisher chose this story. It is full of action, romance, daring, treachery, historical mysteries, and evil villains. From a high flying dogfight with antique planes, to a Roman laberynth, to the villain's secret lair, the story keeps moving, weaving a rather intricate little story about Bruno von Till and how his operation came to be, while our heroes try to outwith both the police and the villains and put an end to the smuggler.THE CONS: While the story is quite thrilling, some of the problems common to Cussler's earlier works are there, namely the female characters. Pitt's \\"seduction\\" of the main heroine by slapping her is a bit much, even for a macho-adventure book. The ending is a bit of a letdown too, without giving away too much, it feels more like a whodunit climax with Pitt unmasking the villains and explaining their crimes rather than physically confronting any of them."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"If this had been the first Cussler book I had read I would never have read another. Dirk Pitt was a jerk. I didn't like the \\"hero\\" at all; never did. I don't recommend this to anyone unless they are dye-hard fans of Cussler (and I am)."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Clive Cussler's Mediterranean Caper is the first Cussler book I picked up to read and I enjoyed it. This is not the first Dirk Pitt story, but it was the first published. Dirk Pitt is a Major transferred from the Air Force to the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA). On paper he is the Surface Security Officer. In reality, when an oceanic research project has trouble, Pitt flies in, figures out the problem, fixes it and gets the project back on track.In Mediterranean Caper, the First Attempt research vessel is in the Aegean Sea looking for a missing link fish. Some unusual accidents take place; Dirk Pitt swoops in for the rescue to run into an apparent ghost plane. While sorting out the problems with the research project and an explanation for the ghost plane, Pitt runs into a drug smuggling scheme, undercover agents, and a traitor. I am no expert when it comes to the Air Force or anything military for that matter, so I have no idea about plausibility. For me it was an exciting story filled with twists and turns.The point of view did bounce around a bit, but I did not have trouble following it. Cussler does a good job introducing characters, so I had no trouble keeping track of everybody. I will warn you that Dirk Pitt is very James Bond-esque. In fact the whole story has that feel to it, but since I'm a fan of James Bond, it works. All in all, a fun, entertaining read and I will be looking for another Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt adventure to read."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"My first Clive Cussler. I wanted to see how it all began and I was not disappointed! Sure, Dirk Pitt's adventure here is a bit surreal (how he takes a shower?!), but you won't be able to put it down. I wasn't all too happy with the denouement being spelled out all in one chapter. And I wonder how Dirk deduced some of the things he did. I think it would make Mr. Spock envious.But, all in all, I'd recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"You gotta love Dirk Pitt! It is fun to watch him go from 1970's macho, sexist pig to macho feminist over the 35 years covered by the books. I love it that Cussler writes himself into the books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"A wonderful example of Cussler's best. Enjoyable from the first page. I found the plot plausible and entertaining. Four Thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Very early Clive Clussler. The characters have yet to develop and in fact are being developed over the series of books. Slow going at first but livens up toward the middle moving to the end.If you want to see where the characters start at, this is one of the books to read. (Dirk Pitt and pals)."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"It is unusual for my library to not be able to find a book, but such was the case for this early Cussler. It has been read, enjoyed, and passed on to another fan. Thank You"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I nearly gave this three stars because of one annoyance. At the end of the story you get all the details courtesy of a long monologue (its almost tiresome). Up to that point this is really a good story. It starts out with a bang, and keeps on going. Actually if Cussler had played out the details he reveals in the monologue in a different way, he could have added another 50 pages and made this story really well formed. Given this was written in 1973 I suppose we can forgive Pitt for his smoking cigarettes. I found that the story still translated well to 2009, its not like I was saying \\"back in the old days they did it like that...\\". If you're already a Cussler fan, then this is a must read to get the full development of Dirk Pitt over the years."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AFTER reading 4 other cussler novels. I wasn't disappointed, but this this book just doesn't grip you like the others. It is less involved and the ending was quick. A good read for a train or plane, it is short and goes quickly."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I have a certain fondness for this Cussler novel, sure its missing some of those fun \\"pretitles\\" style preludes that tie together seemingly unrelated historical events in an ingenious manner and it's also very politically incorrect (but not as much as PACIFIC VORTEX is). But, this Dirk Pitt adventure (the first published, though Cussler wrote the aforementioned PACIFIC VORTEX first), is a fun ride of a novel and moves along at a fast pace (it's actually one of Cusslers shortest, if not THE shortest). With some very vivid fight scenes and some nice Alistair Maclean-esque plotting (apparently Cussler used the late Scottish writer's work as a template until he found his own style) this Cussler novel really delivers and I made fast work of it reading over a weekend about a year ago.Starting with the attack on a US airfield in the Greek islands by a biplane and involving smuggling, German fighter aces and the trademark underwater sequences for which Cussler is perhaps best known for (through his non-fiction writings as much as for Dirk Pitt) I can guarantee that this novel will no doubt charm even the harshest of Cusslers critics as long as they take it for what it is - some harmless. Mildly diverting fun.On a sidenote, all the reviewers who are commenting on the bad writing should really lighten up, this was after all one of Clive Cussler's earliest works :)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I will keep this review short. I have read all of Cussler's works over the past dozen years or so. I read The Mediterranean Caper perhaps ten years ago. To this day I still believe that it was my favorite of the Dirk Pitt stories. If you are a new fan of Cussler - pull this older book out. It is a classic."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I first started reading Cussler when I found Pacific Vortex at my condo complex's library. I became addicted. Dirk Pitt novels are all top-notch adventure stories with political suspense, romance, and high-speed car chases thrown in. This is the 2nd book in the series, though it was the first one printed, and is an exciting, riveting adventure tale. I don't want to spoil a lot, but the plot is excellent, and as always, as twisty as the roads Pitt drives his sports cars on. It all starts when Dirk Pitt, the main hero, and Al Giordano find an antique WWII Bomber plane attacking a United States Base. With the help of a beautiful secret agent, Pitt is thrown into a wild action-packed tale of danger and villanous criminals. As with many Pitt books, the political entanglements can sometimes slow the action, but I still highly recommend this story, and the rest of the series. Enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This is the first of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. This was my second book by Cussler having discovered him by reading Dragon first. AS soon as I realized there were books before Dragon I ran to the bookstore and for the first three and The Mediterranean Caper bring first I devoured it. I was hooked (officially!). It was great to find Dirk Pitt as he was first introduced to the world. A swashbuckling character part James Bond part Indiana Jones (long before there was an Indiana Jones). This is a great start toa long and wonderful life of a character. I will concede that some of the actions of Dirk are a bit over the top. He is a true womanizer , but you also have to remember when the book was originally written. That is what \\"manly spies\\" did... yeah i know its no excuse but people this is not great literature, its escapist reading. For those of you that are just now discovering Cussler you are lucky... you don't have to wait 6 months to a year for the next novel you have many to read (also the character does grow and mature...)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Clive Cussler's books always remind me of a James Bond movie. The plots are preposterous, the hero is far too perfect, and the women fall into his bed much too easily. Nevertheless, they're so much fun that they keep you turning the pages until the very end. The hero, Dirk Pitt, is an Air Force Major on assignment to the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA) as a kind of trouble shooter. In this case, Pitt is sent to Thasos (a small island off the coast of Greece) to investigate sabotage attempts being made against a NUMA scientific expedition. He immediately finds himself in the middle of an air raid on a U.S. Air Force base - a raid made by a World War I era biplane. Pitt ultimately winds up bringing down a Nazi war criminal who has eluded justice long enough to become perhaps the world's most clever and dangerous smuggler. In the process he becomes romantically involved with a beautiful Narcotics agent posing as the smuggler's niece while narrowly escaping death several times. In short, if you like James Bond you'll love Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Look, this is a very early work - and the edges are really rough. The writing is pretty stilted. The plot plays games with the reader. The attitude towards women is really wretched. It isn't a terribly good book by any measure. Read this book if you are already a Cussler fan and you want to explore his early works. Don't read this as your first exposure to Cussler. You might well not give him a second chance - and some of his other books are really quite good. My personal favorites are _Raise the Titanic_ and _Night Probe_. Those are also pretty early efforts, but even a couple of books past _The Mediterranean Caper_ he had settled down into a pretty darned effective writer who could tell a good tale without totally annoying the average reader. If you already gave this book a try and hated it - try one of the above two before you give up on Cussler entirely."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"A great book from start to finnish...... Cant wait to read the rest of the Dirk Pitt series. Im sure they will be jsut as good if not better. Check this book out, its a great book and a fast read. Also check out any books from AJ Quinnell (Man on Fire, Siege of Silence.....Check them all out !!!!)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"In this outer, Dirk Pitt, NUMA's deep-diving hero, tangles with an elaborate smuggling ring that treats the Aegean waters like their own bath tub. In one of their bolder moves, the smugglers strike at nearby USAF base using nothing more than a WWI fighter. Millions of dollars worth of air force aircraft shatter and burn when struck by the primitive fighter's machine gun. Nearby, an NUMA research ship is also targeted by the smugglers. In striking back, Pitt will face a WWII U-boat skipper and a hot Grecian beauty. It's a thin Pitt adventure - closer to the Kurt Austin NUMA books, but still above them. It's closer to \\"Pacific Vortex\\" than one of the larger (and globe-spanning) novels like \\"Cyclops\\" or \\"Raise the Titanic\\". A lot of it is over-the-top (even with their planes on the ground, wouldn't a USAF base have other forms of protection? And are 20 ton airplanes a tad bit more damage resistant?) On the plus side, it's still a dependable Pitt actioner and Cussler (still keeping himself out of the story) gets some good use of the hot Aegean settings."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I am a Clive Cussler Fan and normally love his Dirk Pitt books but this one I did not like because the Dirk character was very different than I am used to. He angered very easily,swore a lot and was not a likable person. It was one of Clive's earlier novels and I guess the character Dirk Matured in his later novels. I do not recommend this book to anyone but read his later ones they are great!I have read at least 20 of Clive's books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This can't be a Clive Cussler book!!! Thankfully I have read all other books by him and his \\"ghosts\\" This one was wretched! Pitt was a foul mouth rapist with few redeeming features. It's hard to believe Cussler turned this pig's ear into a silk purse. Do NOT read this book."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"The story was fun and had some great twists. The writing style was still undeveloped, I think, but I raced through this book. The villans were villanous. The good guys were great. The others kept you guessing. And the link to WW1 was interesting."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This was my first Cussler novel, and while I liked the plot, I felt that it was not well-written. In addition to being somewhat offensive to women, the narrator used trite expression after trite expression. Really it was irritating."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"As usual any book written by Clive Cussler is superb thriller and is very good. What else can I say?"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"The dirk pitt adventures, always an involving story line. Cussler can always make hours go by quickly when reading his books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"One of the more misogynistic Dirk Pitt novels, and hence feels quite dated.Usually I just roll with his standard take on women in this author's novels, but this one seemed more extremely unbalanced in how he expressed the lead female character, to the point that it was distracting and felt out of tone. I have read many of Mr.Cussler's books, and will continue to, but feel this is just an area that modern female readers need to just ignore - women are viewed as chattel or worse, and this book errs on the side of outright disgust. I need to read more of the novels with the Fargos to appreciate a more balanced and nuanced approach."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"This was Cussler's first Dirk Pitt novel. I would not have bought this if I had not been mislead by Amazon. On your website, you represent this book as published in 2004. It was actually first published in 1973. I read most of the Dirk Pitt early novels and as the character has progressed, he is much more entertaining. In closing, I would have never bought this novel if you had accurately stated it was first published in 1973. If you search my buying history, I am a regular customer. Shame on Amazon for this misleading marketing."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I like all of Cussler's books. He makes the finding of a mystery in history seem like it could have really happened the way he wrote about it."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"I have greatly enjoyed the Cussler &#34;Oregon Files&#34; series, this was my first read of a &#34;Dirk Pitt Adventure&#34;. A let down to say the least. The writing is sophomoric at best.Character developement is nonexistent and the story line is plodding and painfully predictable. This book totally lacks the artistic sophistication of the &#34;Oregon Files&#34; writings. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Nothing is better than a good Dirk Pitt adventure and you don't have to read them in order of publishing date. Characters are real, details and technicality is so spot on you feel they could be truth instead of fiction - Cusler draws you into the plot and the lives of the characters with such ease and realism that you don't even realize how much you know them. Love his work."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper","review":"Another great book by Clive Cussler. A dirk Pitt adventure and a hard to put down reading. Another one added to my list of his books read."},{"Title":"Passing of the Third Floor Back","review":"In this charming short story, a stranger arrives at a boarding house in England, where the inhabitants and the landlady all have a variety of character flaws, from the penurious landlady to the vain 39-year-old woman trying to pass for much younger to the husband and wife who bicker constantly to the young woman determined on jilting her love in favor of someone with money. Around the stranger, however, they begin to act strangely, showing consideration for others.\\"Passing of the Third Floor Back\\" (the title refers to the stranger's room at the boarding house) is one of my all-time favorite short stories, right up there with \\"The Story of an Hour,\\" \\"One Ordinary Day with Peanuts,\\" \\"The Open Window,\\" \\"Popular Girls\\" (byKaren Shepard), \\"A Wagner Matinee,\\" and several others. The writing is typical ofJerome K. Jerome's work--carefully crafted and often quite funny. This story, which was later made into afilm, may be suitable for any age, but the prose is sometimes difficult to get through and requires a certain assuredness of the reader. The reward more than justifies the effort."},{"Title":"Passing of the Third Floor Back","review":"I went on a Jerome Jerome kick and decided to read everything he wrote, in no particular order. I don't recommend this practice, because after a few you realize that it's all a blur! And now I have trouble distinguishing this title from the rest. But I can say that they are all clever, witty and outdated in a fun way (learn something about \\"olden\\" times - and that people and their cares have been the same for centuries). As the author ages his circumstances change (marriage, kids, etc.), so it would have helped to know their chronological order and follow it before I started the endeavor. It's been a few months (and dozens of books) since I read this, and I don't remember the premise - which may be all you need to know as a recommendation on whether or not to read it :)."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"Rarely do I finish a book and immediately want to read it again. This, however, was the case with The Revenant. It is a novel of revenge yet includes so much more. The usual predictablity of this genre was lost on Punke as he relives life in the early mountain west. The story is vivid and captivating; written in such a way that you feel personally involoved. Furhtermore, the ending will leave you pondering your own resolve...Truly a great read and a debut that suggests great things for Punke's future as a writer."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"From the opening chapter, setting the tone for the entire work, to the end at which you find yourself pondering your own sense of justice, The Revanant flows like a sparkling river. It is a great read, and is filled with dramatic and well-described moments that will stay with you for a long time.As unbelievable as it sounds, the basic tale of this mountainman's maiming by a grizzly bear and his abandonment by his comrades, and his survival, is true. The author's imagination adds details and color that are truly remarkable and compelling. For example, the scene where the Indians who find Glass are cleaning his infected and infested wounds is full of realistic details, and helps to illustrate what Glass has gone through. The other scene that I won't forget is the snowy camp where Glass arrives to take revenge on one of the comrades who regretfully left him to die after the attack. Punke also has a great style which weaves the past with the present to keep the story flowing while giving important background information that helps explain the impetus behind all the characters' actions.These are rich characters, too -- characters who epitomize the developing West. There are lawless men, leaders, and followers. There are men of justice and those who are seeking justice beyond the courts of Men. It is a story that could only come from a author from the West, as Punke is (born and raised on the Platte River in Wyoming according to the book cover). You can feel his love for the land, for the danger, for the adventure, and his appreciation for the men who journeyed through this area of the country 175 years ago, blazing the way for others, and discovering truths about themselves and about America.The chapters are short, making the book hard to put down. You will find yourself wanting to read it aloud, too, because of the richness of the language and the detail that Punke includes. If you are like me, you will also be thinking about how this would look on the big screen. As I understand Punke has already sold the movie rights, it's only a matter of time before this story finds its way to theaters. It is perfect for a movie -- big moments, big characters, big scenery, and big themes.I look forward to Punke's future works. If this is his first book, you have to expect big things from him."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"&quot;The Revenant's&quot; fast pace and expert storytelling make it as much action/adventure as western epic. Punke's vivid detail of the early west combines with his sharp characterizations to create a compelling story, one that had me both squirming and turning the pages in anticipation. The book's focus on revenge, justice and humanity, make it especially relevant today.I look forward to Punke's next novel."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"A great read - gripping, well-written, and tightly constructed. I'm not much of a reader of American Westerns, but I found The Revenant to be an interesting mix that is not easily placed in any obvious genre - it is part historical fiction but also part Undaunted Courage, part Into Thin Air. In some ways, it reminded me of survival stories that I loved as a kid (e.g., Island of the Blue Dolphins), and it is a fast-paced, entertaining read. In other ways, however, it is a very intelligent, nuanced examination of human nature - never heavy-handed and surprisingly moving. I also highly recommend it as a gift for those readers who profess never to read novels because they are &quot;too boring&quot;: the story includes great historical detail about, among other things, the fur trade, Mountain Men, outdoor survival skills, and the incredible natural terrain of the West."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"This thrilling, gripping novel brings to life the adventure and drama of the West in the 1820s, the era of the fur trappers. Based on the true story of Hugh Glass, a trapper who sought revenge after being left for dead by his colleagues following a bear mauling. The writing is vivid and compelling and, well, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Michael Punke has obviously done his research, too, because the reader practically can feel what it must have been like to have been on the Missouri River in the 1820s. Probably the best novel about the early West since Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove books."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"Not only is The Revanant a compelling story about revenge, but it also is a story about the overwhelming human survival instinct, particularly in early frontier America. The historical story of Hugh Glass is amazing in and of itself, but The Revanant brings it to life. The book graphically describes the seemingly insurmountable obstacles faced by trapper Hugh Glass, first in trying to survive, then in seeking vengeance. You can almost feel Hugh Glass' shattered body.In addition to being a gripping story, The Revanant literally transports you to the wild, unpredictable American West of the 1820's. It is impeccably well researched with extensive and fascinating historical detail. This detail, combined with great writing and an incredible story results in a perfect adventure novel for any summer reading list."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"Author Punke does an excellent job of presenting the true story of Hugh Glass, a scout for a trapping party exploring the Missouri River area in 1823. During this expedition, he was horribly mauled by a bear but managed to survive even though severely wounded. Unfortunately, the two men assigned to wait with him until he either got better or died, deserted him with no weapons or tools. The remainder of the book tells of Hugh's story of survival and revenge.Excellently written with vivid characters, the story demonstrates again just how unforgiving nature can be but how one man can survive even against huge odds.I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"I could not put it down and read it straight through.

There were many times that I set this book down after a reading sesion and found that I might rather not pick it up again. It's a tribute to the fascinating true tale of Hugh Glass, his determination to survive and drive for revenge that I was able to choke down this book. I'm not sure if this will make sense, but I wish I read like a novel, rather than a novelization of a true story as penned by a historian. The internal thought processes were hammy, the secondary characters were carictures and any moment that felt like there was supposed to have emotional heft came across as trite.But I did finish the book, and felt like I got some historical context out of it, so it wasn't a total waste."},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"Reading stories about the American West, especially in the early 19th century when frontiersmen travelled into the largely unexplored wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, has a way of calming the spirit while spurring the imagination. This is especially true for stories written by skillful wordsmiths who weave fact and fiction with threads of adventure and human emotion.From the talented Michael Punke comes such a story. Mountain man Hugh Glass, scouting for the Rocky Mountain Fur Co. is attacked by a grizzly bear and left with two men while he either heals or dies. Instead, they choose to leave him, expecting he can't recover from the savage attack. They take his gun and knife and away they go, convinced it is the last they'll see or hear of Hugh Glass. WRONG!THE REVENANT is subtitled A Novel of Revenge. Certainly revenge is the powerful motive driving Glass to overcome unimaginable pain endured in an unforgiving environment so he can catch up to the men and mete out his own form of justice. However, it is also a story of survival and enlightenment. The encounters Glass has with a wide and varied cast of colorful characters throughout his journey drives the story and measures change and personal growth. When he meets his antagonists in a surprising climax, the reader has had time to reflect upon what s/he would do in a similar situation.THE REVENANT is a powerful adventure and is fertile ground for empathic imagination. It is an excellent story, well-written and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge","review":"I enjoyed this novel - it is a good day read!

The writing is vivid and compelling and, well, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Michael Punke has obviously done his research, too, because the reader practically can feel what it must have been like to have been on the Missouri River in the 1820s.

After he left Rhema he became pastor of one of the most successful churches in Tulsa Oklahoma (AKA land of a thousand churches) where he has only grown his congregation for decades. That in itself is a testament to the worth of this book since the worshipers choose his church over so many other options in that city.

It is somewhat like a president making Constitutional changes to justify authority that wasn't his in the first place.Mr. Yandian would do well to study the works in systematic theology out there. He has not cited one in his non-existent bibliography. It is sad to think that people may be following this book in building their church government.This book makes the pastor the sole church ruler, ultimately answerable only to God. It ignors the fact that the New Testament words &quot;pastor&quot;, &quot;elder&quot; and &quot;overseer&quot; denote one and the same office and that churches had a plurality of these leaders.

How has it been able to propagate itself across contemporary American Culture in such a way that it can be found on any given day everywhere from cartoons-that big orange thing with tennis shoes chasing bugs bunny through a castle-to upper division university literature seminars? Well, it IS a monster story, but that doesn't explain it. It is pretty well written, for having a young author, but only in the Romantic tradition, with all of the attendant thickly written melodrama and blubbery prose-think Anne Rice without the Prozac or sex. So Shelley's literary talents don't really explain it either. It does sort of begin the mad-scientist routine that we \`modern' folks love so much, which picked up some real momentum with the publication of Stevenson's \`Jekyll and Hyde'. I suspect that partially accounts for some of its continuing appeal to the adult reader and movie-goer. Shelley did spend a great deal of energy ruminating on the possible moral and ethical implications of messing around with the natural order of things. She let the good doctor cross that line and mess around with some taboo stuff, the defeat of death and all of that. And her commentary on the matter is clear: good old-fashioned Romantic fear. The monster really lets him have it. I won't go into it, I don't want to give away any of the story. Now we're beginning to understand some of its appeal, but even a decent monster story and fore-shadowing of the human-cloning debate don't entirely account for the fact that there will surely be at least one kid who, with stitches painted on his green face and mock bolts sticking from the sides of his neck, will lurch up to my doorstep October 31st and holler \`Trick or Treat' in monsterspeak. Here's where I need to get a bit more serious with my analysis, because I suspect that Frankenstein is one of just a few texts that is actually important, because it was instrumental in helping literature-an as expository art form-climb to the next level. The Victorian era was a landscape of chaos-think Industrial and French revolutions-from which a most unsightly, energetic, and important monster lurched to life and strode across Europe like a colossus. No, not Frankenstein's monster, I'm talking about Freud. Intellectuals of the day had wonderful avenues of speculation to discuss over coffee. All kinds of new things were going on and it is no wonder that, from that great mixing of intellectual nutrients-the Victorian petri-dish of ideas and ideals-we get Mary Shelley's gem. It combines, in ambitious literary metaphor, Freud's ideas of the ego, id, and unconscious-Frank, his creation, and the \`desert mountains and deep, glacial ravines'-with concerns over science, and all the while paying homage to the backdrop of Christianity that lay under Europe like the mantle of the Earth-a creator who despises his creation, who, in turn, loves and hates his creator. It's wonderful stuff. The Victorian century, with all that was going on, was just ripe for this kind of mixed speculation and commentary, and we are the lucky inheritors of the fruits of that chaotic time. Frankenstein, because of its depth of conscience, and the breadth of its ambitious, allegorical commentary, will undoubtedly be around for quite some time. I urge prospective readers to set aside their previous ideas about the story, their visions of lurching monsters-I always get the tennis-shoed, orange hairball or the blockhead in Young Frankenstein howling \`Fire Bad!'-and take the time to read the story from a fresh perspective. It's well worth it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Upon first glance, Mary Shelley&#65533;s Frankenstein can be seen as a simple horror story of a brilliant, if not obsessive scientist who in his quest to create life unwittingly unleashes a hideous, seemingly unstoppable monster upon the world. As the novel progresses, the reader must decide who the real monster of the story is. Is it the murderous creature, Frankenstein creates? Or is it Frankenstein himself. Ultimately, this question leads to a chilling finale amid the frozen arctic in which both characters apparently perish forever.That would be the impression one would get after just a light reading of the text, but if one were to look much closer at the novel, they may discover many other things about this re-markable piece of Victorian literature. One of the major themes in Frankenstein seems to be one of rebellion. Victor Frankenstein rebels against the laws of nature by playing God and creating life. In turn, his creation also rebels against a society that fears and hates him. Before this hap-pens, though, the creature must first learn the concept of rebellion. The creature does this in through books it finds while hiding out in the barn of an old cabin. As the creature carries out its self-education, one book it turns to is Paradise Lost. Upon reading this, the creature remarks, &#65533;Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss on my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me&#65533; (Shelley 105). The creature takes on many aspects of Satan from Paradise Lost, and can perhaps be called a &#65533;Satanic Hero&#65533; because of this. The creature in this book can be seen as rebelling against a society that fears and hates him.Other important items, a reader can look for upon reading this novel is an emphasis on extremes, excess and feelings that appears throughout the course of the book. This emphasis on extremes can be best discerned by Victor Frankenstein&#65533;s decision not to make a mate for the creature. In regards to this, he states, &#65533;&#65533; for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race&#65533; (Shelley 138). Here we see that Frankenstein&#65533;s mindset is one of extremes. He believes that his work can either save mankind by curing death or destroy mankind completely. Simi-larly, the landscapes described in Frankenstein are ones of excess. They are rugged and craggy, extremes of nature.It would be an understatement to say that this novel has had a great effect on many forms of literature that have followed it. However, Frankenstein can also be seen as more than a sim-ple horror story. For some reason, we cannot truly hate the creature despite the numerous acts of depravity it might exact in its quest for vengeance. No matter how many innocents die by his hands, the creature still appears somewhat sympathetic to us. Perhaps this is why in the original cut of James Whales&#65533; film version of Frankenstein he had a scene in which Boris Karloff&#65533;s creature attempts to rescue a little girl he has thrown into a pond, upon realizing that she cannot swim. This scene was eventually cut before the film was released, a result no doubt of a society unable to find sympathy in a monster.That is not the case for the many who have read Shelley&#65533;s novel though. In the end, the creature may be more human than it is given credit for. Reaching the end of the book, we are left feeling that perhaps the only thing the creature wanted was to have a mate, and to not be lonely. That has to be something all human beings long for at least once in their lives."},{"Title":"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Frankenstein was... interesting. It made me think more about what would happen if we could create life. And I definitely appreciate OUR Creater more now! But I didn't really enjoy it very much. It was stilted and painful, and I'm not really into this genre anyway. But I'm glad I read it, if only to know the real story.SPOILER WARNING!The book starts off with a series of letters from a man named Robert Walton to his sister. They tell her about his adventures in Russia, getting ready to sail, and then sailing into the North. Robert is determined to succeed in his exploration, but he is weakened by his strong desire for a true friend to share this dream come true with. Then his wish is granted: the ship picks up a man on a sledge. He is almost dead, but an eager Robert Walton takes care of him, and lavishes him with attention. Eventually the stranger decides to tell Robert his life story.His name is Victor Frankenstein.The first few chapters detail his family background: his parents and how they met, their travels, and their adoption of a child named Elizabeth. Frankenstein grew up with Elizabeth as one of his dearest friends, (even more than a sister). His other close friend was a boy named Henry.Growing up, Frankenstein shows a great deal of interest in science and magic. After his mother's death, he goes to university, and after much study, discovers the secret of life, which is not made known in the book. Frankenstein creates a 'being' immediately is repulsed and horrified, runs away in fright, and then goes mad with fever. Luckily his friend Henry is there to take care of him, and Elizabeth faithfully writes him with all the news of home, including the story of a servant girl named Justine, who is loved in the home. When Frankenstein recovers, he goes on a vacation with Henry, and finally is happy again. But his happiness is not to last for long.Frankenstein receives a letter telling of his younger brothers death at the hands of a murderer. He catches a glimpse of the being he created soon after, and knows that he is the culprit. But Justine has been accused of the murder, and is condemned to death, and there is nothing he can do about it.Frankenstein goes for a hike, and meets the Creature, who asks him to listen to his story. It is a sad one, of a Creature learning to survive in a world where everyone hates him for his ugliness. It's fairly long, detailing his observations of a family, learning to read and talk, and his ultimate rejection by those he loves, sending him over the brink into rage. Finally the Creature asks Frankenstein to make him a girlfriend, saying they will go far away and never bother Frankenstein anymore.Frankenstein decides to do what The Creature asks of him, and travels to England and Scotland to get the necesary information. In a small cottage in Scotland he begins the dirty work, and is about halfway there, upset and discouraged when he sees the Creature again. Horror filled thoughts flood his mind, and in a fit he rips up the girlfriend, leaving her in pieces on the floor. The Creature threatens to kill him and says 'I will be there on your wedding night.' Frankenstein has made up his mind, however, and sets sail, dumping the pieces of girlfriend overboard. He is blown off course, though, and ends up in a small village in Ireland, where he is accused of murder.The Creature has killed his best friend, Henry, and Frankenstein is accused of it. What does Frankenstein do? Goes into another mad fever.When things work out, and Frankenstein is better, he goes home and decides to marry Elizabeth, even though he often thinks of the Creature's wedding night warning. And it happens: Elizabeth is killed that night, his father dies from shock, and Frankenstein is thought mad. HFinally Frankenstein has had enough, and is filled with revenge. e pursues the Creature all over the world, and eventually to the North, where his strength gave out and he met Robert Walton. At the end of his story, he begs Robert to kill the Creature for him.Robert Walton's ship is stuck in the ice. His men mutiny peacefully, and force him to agree to turn back when they get un-stuck. Frankenstein protests, because he NEEDS to get the Creature, but it is no use. He dies. Robert finds the Creature in Frankenstein's room, upset over the dead body. Robert accuses him of ruining Frankenstein's life, which is pretty obvious!

The impulse behind this trend is an honorable one (to present what is seemingly an author's \\"final revision\\"),but the 1818 version is preferable for many reasons. Looking back on her creation in later life, Shelley felt obliged to alter the book's focus in significant ways, adding what critic Marilyn Butler accurately describes as \\"long passages in which her main narrator, [Victor] Frankenstein, expresses religious remorse for making a creature...\\" The author sought to make the 1831 edition less controversial and thereby more palatable to the tastes of the reading public. The 1818 version is closer to Mary Shelley's original intentions, though it too, unfortunately, was filtered through the sensibilities of her husband, the poet Percy Shelley, who took many of his wife's rather straightforward passages and rendered them into his own more ornate and Ciceronian style. Still, the 1818 version remains more vital, more original, and less constrained by what the author believed would be acceptable to readers in 1830s England."},{"Title":"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The original version of Frankenstein (or, The Modern Prometheus) was published anonymously in 1818. However, the version of Frankenstein that most people have read is the 1831 edition, which has significant changes from the original 1818 text. This book gives the readers a chance to experience the original text, which is less refined and a bit darker then the revised text. It also provides a wonderful introduction and notes discussing Mary Shelley's life, the context in which this story was written, and the differences between the original text and the 1831 edition. These notes and introduction are by Marilyn Butler, who was a Professor of English Literature at Cambridge.The story is well known, although certainly the book is nothing like most of the movies that use its name. While clearly one can find many issues from Mary Shelley's life and times that are addressed in this book, what makes it stand the test of time is how it can be made to relate to modern day issues as well. One theme, science creates a \\"monster\\" which it cannot control and which ultimately destroys the lives of those that created it, can be found today in areas such as genetics, nuclear physics, etc., and will undoubtedly be with us in the future as well. Other themes from the story carry forward from 1818 to today as well, which undoubtedly why this story is a classic and will always endure."},{"Title":"Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Victor Frankenstein was a precocious child, inspired by and obsessed with the scientists of the past. In university, he continues his obsession, which culminates in the creation of a man made of corpses. As the creature awakens, Victor is horrified and disgusted and runs away. He becomes stricken with illness shortly afterwards and his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, helps nurse him back to health. After four months, Victor finally recovers, only to find that his little brother, William, has been murdered. Sure that the fiend he created is responsible, Victor returns to his home. The tormented creature eventually reveals himself to his furious creator and relays the events leading to William's murder. After his heart-rending story, he begs his creator to make a woman for him who will accept him and become his mate. Victor agrees, but has second thoughts. Should he create another monster like the one already in existence? If he decides against this second blasphemy, what repercussions will he and his family have to endure?Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein is an iconic work that has spawned countless spin-offs, sequels, remakes, copies, and re-imaginings. It's hardly surprising considering the eloquence and skill that she exhibits. With all the allusions and references to literature and works of science, she shows her vast education, which is even surprising today for an eighteen year old. I absolutely love this book, but I used to hate it. I remember reading it as a child and finding it boring and hard to understand. As an adult, I see the different philosophies being illustrated and the significance of its place in the romantic era. It explores themes such as the nature of man, the effect of isolation verses society on man, and the ethics of science. These are themes that science fiction authors are still writing about today, as seen in the film Splice, Scott Sigler's novel Ancestor, and countless others. This is really the epitome of the gothic novel, which conveys its messages with a dose of horror and suspense.The characters and their development is really what makes Frankenstein special. I can see the suffering and anger on both Victor's and the creature's side. Victor is a good person who got swept up in his fervor for science without thinking about the consequences. After making the creature, he tries to move forward with his life, but his past follows him. The creature, on the other hand, is actually a sympathetic character. Far from the shuffling, silent monster seen in film, he exhibits great intelligence and is shown to be inherently good. After being consistently rejected and abused by man, he turns to violence and really only to mimic how people have always treated him. He only ever desired to be loved and accepted. I tend to side more with the monster because he was created and then immediately abandoned with no instruction on how to act or survive in the human world. I find the fact that Victor finds this acceptable and proceeds to further antagonize his creation reprehensible.I could probably go on and on about how Frankenstein is one of the best books ever written, so I'll stop here. This work is still relevant today and can both horrify and interest modern audiences.

Lindsey had come west because of an illness in hopes the drier climate would ease his illness, but Spanish Peaks set smack dab in the middle of a dangerous gang of outlaws and cattle thieves who effectively controlled the area.

The book is a mere 634 pages, that is, two thirds as long as Copperfield but a 100 pages longer than The Old Curiosity Shop. One of Dickens' strong points is atmosphere, and this novel is one of his best in that department. His description of the Maypole Inn and its proprietor, slow John, is marvelous. Much of the book describes the riots and their effect on various characters. Barnaby himself is an idiot, but such an excellent character for all that. The villians actually have good qualities in this book. And by the way, the Raven Grip is supposedly the model for Poe's raven. I would not start reading Dickens with Barnaby, but even though it's not as well known as ten other of his novels, I can highly recommend if you like other Dickens to give this book a read. I intend to reread it in my next round of Dickens rereading."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Dickens is one of my favourite authors, and I took up this book simply because I wanted to read all his books. \\"Barnaby Rudge\\", though is a little different than some of Dickens' other works. For one it's about a true historical happening. The riots of 1780 actually did occur. It's one of his shorter books, and it was written earlier on in his career. The book is really not where a reader should start with Dickens' books, but it should be read nonetheless. It still has the same great characterizations and atmosphere that we expect from Dickens, and it's still a good story. Barnaby is quite the character. We have to laugh at his antics, and Slow John at the Maypole Inn is absolutely wonderful. I read this book quite awhile ago, and while I'm writing this review, I'm thinking I need to reread it again. Wonderful atmosphere!"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is a well paced and fast-moving historical novel set during the anti-popery riots in London in 1780. Although not as grippingly exciting as Dicken's other historical novel, A Tale Of Two Cities, there is plenty of drama here to sustain the reader's interest.The fictional characters are well woven into the historical setting, and the portrayal of these characters gives the book some of its best comic moments, from the suave Edward Chester, to the vengeful Simon Tappertit, to the spiteful Miss Miggs, to the devious hangman, Dennis. The hero of the book is Gabriel Varden, whom Dickens repeatedly describes, rather clumsily, as &quot;the honest locksmith&quot;. Varden has to suffer constant friction in his own household between himself, his wife, his apprentice and his maid, and this agitation reflects the agitation of the masses in the streets.One of the best features of the book is the way it successfully carries a number of plot lines. The main one of these concerns a murder committed many years previously for which no-one has been convicted. There are several other sub-plots such as the tension between the Catholic Haredale and the Protestant Chester, Joe Willet's love for Varden's daughter, the comical scheming of the apprentice locksmith against his master and the presence of a shadowy stranger who pursues Barnaby Rudge's mother. Some elements of the plot fizzle out a bit too easily towards the end, such as the attempt to kidnap Haredale's daughter, but the overall effect of the book is very satisfying.This is one of Dicken's least remembered novels, but I think it is well worth reading and an excellent introduction to his work."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Having left Dickens until later in life, I just completed Barnaby Rudge as part of my attempt to go through his novels in chronological order, starting with Pickwick. Barnaby Rudge is a very different animal from the 4 prior novels, patterned after it was on the swashbuckling historical style of Scott. It's so different from Old Curiosity Shop, which he was writing at the same time as Barnaby Rudge, that it's hard to believe it's the work of the same author, except for the quality of exceptionally vivid characterizations that pervade all the books.I knew nothing of the historical events upon which the book is based, that, at the time of original publication, were well known to most Londoners, almost as well known as 9/11 is known by contemporary New Yorkers. Dickens seemed to have anticipated this problem, as the historical recreation is so beautifully folded into the melodrama that I never felt left behind. DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION as too many plot points were given away and spoiled some of the dramatic impact for this reader. Save the introduction for afterward.The characters are so memorable, it is painful to have to complete the book and say goodbye to them. Especially John Willet, and his double-chin, which almost deserves billing as a character in and of itself, Sir John Chester, a poetic achievement to whom Oscar Wilde and Shaw owed enormous debts, Maypole Hugh, and Grip the Raven (from whom Poe got his idea for the poem \\"The Raven), are high water marks of achievement.While I preferred some of the intensely personal, experimental style of the latter half of Oliver Twist and much of Old Curiosity Shop, the confident and bold tone of the narration in Barnaby is a shot of adrenaline in every chapter, and the power of description in Dicken's cinematic viewpoint is incredibly powerful and pulse-poundingly entertaining, while the whole time maintaing a savvy, but never cynical outlook when it comes to the socio-political themes.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Focused primarily on the \\"anti-popery\\" riots in London in1780, and filled with wild scenes of carnage involving a large cast of characters from all levels of society, Barnaby Rudge is Dickens's first historical novel, and it includes the real Lord George Gordon, a virulent anti-Catholic who whipped the populace into a frenzy. The author sets the scene for the tumult by first painting a picture of quiet village society in Chigwell in 1775, five years earlier, often using humor to depict the numerous characters.Geoffrey Haredale, a Catholic, has inherited the estate of his brother Reuben, who was murdered twenty-two years before. He has brought up his niece Emma, who is in love with the kindly Edward Chester, a Protestant, the son of the odious Lord John Chester, who lives nearby. Dozens of characters populate the book--including Barnaby Rudge (the developmentally disabled son of Mary Rudge, who works on an estate), the Willetts (who run the Maypole Inn), Gabriel Varden (a locksmith) and his daughter Dolly (who eventually works for Emma Haredale), mysterious strangers, ghosts, a sinister blind man, and even Grip, Barnaby's talking raven.The action takes off when the time shifts from 1775 to 1780, and the focus changes from village life and the sometimes amusing domestic concerns of the people to the growing anti-Catholic sentiment being stirred up in London. The humor, which has been a big part of the first part of the book, ends, and Dickens concentrates on the growing hatred and the battles spawned by that hatred, with good people being drawn into brutality that they would otherwise avoid. Violence and several deaths take place, the populace becomes a mob, and rioting leads to the burning of properties. The love stories, which have been a large part of the first section of the book, are put on the back burner for the major part of the book.Written in 1841, this is Dickens's fifth novel, one which suffers from its original serialization and loss of focus. Though the atmosphere and some of the characters rank among Dickens's best, and some of the humor in the first part is delightful, the tone is inconsistent, changing with the riots and ensuing action. As is always the case with Dickens, all mysteries are cleared up at the end, with Reuben Haredale's murder solved and the whereabouts revealed of several characters who disappeared between 1775 and 1780. With hints of some of the greatness to come, this novel precedes David Copperfield, Bleak House, and A Tale of Two Cities, and shows Dickens experimenting with his themes and ideas. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This book is probably the most overlooked of Dickens' major efforts. It lacks the silly slapstick and joy of Pickwick Papers, and is missing the biting social commentary (at least not as biting) of Little Dorrit and Hard Times. Also, it is always listed in the &quot;about the author&quot; section as being somewhat of a commercial letdown at the time.The truth is that it is a great book. It has enough silliness to let you know that it is Dickens, but is accompanied by a good bit of darkness. In fact, it's almost macabre at times.In the end, this is a great story from a master storyteller. Isn't this the true benchmark of a classic? For all the ingenius stylism of &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; would we love it half as much (if at all) if the styling didn't accent a most captivating tale? Well, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is just that....a thoroughly captivating tale in the classic Dickens style."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I had read most of the Dickens novels, some more than once, but I'd always overlooked Barnaby Rudge. When I finally read it I was amazed it had taken me so long. It turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected from the blurb on the book.Like all Dickens' novels, the characters are drawn to show the nature of human beings, and he does it so well, the characters could be set in modern day and the story would still work. We see the shifty lecherous rogue who covets the beautiful young lady, the dedicated hangman, and the patriotic family man. We see troubled family relationships: mother and son, father and daughter, and father and son. Most important of all, we see the title character, a golden-hearted idiot whose simple-minded exuberance makes him a ready-made pawn for the devious and evil manipulators who stand to profit from division and resentment between Catholics and Protestants.Perhaps the most timeless thing about this novel is the willful manufacturing of resentment between the two primary social political groups of the time. You could simply replace the terms Catholic and Protestant with Liberal and Conservative and you'd be telling our modern story. Turn on the nightly news and you will see a modern-day Barnaby Rudge there enthusiastically reciting the talking points of some divisive talk-show host, all the while completely oblivious that he is but a pawn dutifully serving a sinister master. I'm glad I waited until now to read this tale of Dickens because it's such a timely reminder of human impulse toward the mob mentality.Barnaby Rudge is an ever present reminder that if we lose our ability to think to think critically, we our own identity and our values will be consumed to serve the desires of someone else."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This year, 2010, the Riverside, CA Dicken's Festival has selected Barnaby Rudge as its featured work for its weekend-long presentation. In my view, nothing could be more timely.Most people have not read this book which was never as popular as some of Dickens' other novels, such as Oliver Twist or David Copperfield. However, this historical novel of a tragic period in English history of the late 18th century, was early on a project Dickens wanted to present. Work on it predated his widely popular Pickwick Papers, on a much more serious subject.It was the religious riots of 1780, precipitated by an unstable member of the House of Lords, Lord George Gordon, who wanted to suppress catholicism, even among members of his own monied class. The cause of \\"No Popery\\" was taken up by mob rule which resulted in a horrendous amount of death and loss of property among all the people of London, including the burning of Newgate prison, Bedlam, the hospital for the insane, and many houses of rich and poor alike.As in all Dickens books, there is a cause that the author wants to present and explore. And this one seems to be an analysis of how mob rule occurs and how people who have little factual information destroy and disrupt both the rule of law and the faculty of common sense. If this were only a historical condition, the novel might be of interest. But, we can easily see how today around the world, the incitement of a few with dubious motives can destroy and disorient the lives of the many.

To my tastes, this little sleeper of a book contends well for top spot, right alongside his more famous larger brothers, like Pickwick and Dombey. When I grow up, I want to be like Gabriel Varden -- a man \\"terrifying in his integrity.\\""},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge (1841)originally appeared as a weekly serial in Dickens'weekly newspaper Master Humphrey's Clock. The novel is the most obscure work by the master. The story is well worth reading. It is an exciting story of the Anti-Roman Catholic riots of 1780 led by the eccentric George Gordon a member of Parliament. The second half of the book focuses on the riots in a cinematic depiction of the mobs who ran amok in London during a hot summer of hatred, prejudice and murder.Character rather than complicated Victorian plot is why we read Dickens. This book adds many memorable folks to the gallery of Dickenscharacters. In this long novel we meet:Barnaby Rudge-the title character is a feeble witted lad whose pet is the famed raven Grip. He lives with his mother. We later learn his evil father Rudge Sr. murdered Lord Haredale's brother. The father is hanged but Barnaby lives to spend time at the Maypole Inn. Years before Dostoevsky's novel \\"The Idiot\\" Dickens took a mentally ill person as his hero. Barnaby is pardoned for his participation in the Gordon riots.Gabriel Varden, his shrewish wife and buxom daughter Dolly live in London where Mr. Varden is a locksmith. After Joe Willet leaves England to fight in the American Revolution he returns home to wed Dolly. A charming love story.The Haredale family tells us of the love of Mr. Haredale's beautiful nieceEmma for Edward the son of John Chester. Chester is a Protestant and a sworn enemy of the Catholic Haredales.Minor charactes such as Hugh (the illegitimate son of Chester); Dennis the hangman; Miss Miggs the man crazy maid to Mrs. Varden and others populate the pages of this fast paced tale of murder,mystery and intrigue.Barnaby Rudge is a fine book which deserves to be better known. It is not Dickens best novel,his longest novel or his most famous novel. Yet it still appeals in its exciting look at the events of 1780. It and the much more famous Tale of Two Cities were the two historical novels the author produced.YOu will never forget Grip the Raven (said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\") or Barnaby and his friends and enemies.

As always, the characters are varied, and spring to life through Dickens's gifts for acute description and memorable dialogue. The plot threads are complex - some admittedly predictable, others full of suspense and surprise. What I appreciate most, however, is the action-packed, central section of the book with its vivid descriptions of the Gordon Riots: terrifying, out-of-control mob violence engendered by religious intollerance. Given the the disasterous effects of rigid religious fundamentalism (across all the major faiths) in the contemporary world, I found this aspect of the novel the most compelling. Add to that the character of the amoral, hypocritical politician Sir John Chester, and we have a work of fiction to remind us that there are lessons to be learned from history. With its relative brevity, compelling ncharacters, and page-turning action sequences, I highly recommend this novel to fans of the author and those new to his oeuvre."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I've never read Charles Dickens before, outside of having read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in school. I decided, a year or so ago, to read some Dickens and see what I thought. This book wouldn't have hooked me, but I'd already read enough stuff to know that this isn't his best. Though it wasn't that good, there were elements of it that were interesting, and that kept me going long enough that I finished it.Barnaby Rudge is a simple man with a talking crow. His mother looks after him. He lives in a world full of people who are more or less friends, or at least acquaintances. Among these are a tavern keeper and his son, a locksmith and his wife and daughter, the locksmith's apprentice, and the locksmith's maid. The book spends several hundred pages on exposition of these characters, with you getting to know more and more about them as the story progresses. The interplay of the characters, with the author interweaving so many plotlines, is apparently a trademark of Dickens, and he puts it on display here, using it for all it's worth. At about the halfway point of the book the plot begins to form, as one of the secondary characters, a British nobleman named Gordon, decides to foment anti-Catholic sentiment because it will bring him political prominence. Of course riots will result, of course people will be killed, and of course Gordon thinks nothing of this, because he's advancing his political career at the same time. Barnaby and the other central characters in the book are caught up in the riots, and their aftermath, and that forms the main plot of the story.I generally enjoyed this book, but I thought the exposition too long (by modern standards anyway) the plot itself too wordy, and the ending I'm afraid was predictable. What saves the book is the characters. On that logic alone I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This recording is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"The Raven dialog drives this novel. I specifically enjoyed the nibbling, figurative and literal, upon Barnaby's shoulder. A delicious pile of words."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"There are many pages in this book that are still alive, but here is a novel that, I'm afraid, would tend to confirm the suspicions of some readers who haven't read Dickens yet -- that he's wordy. This gets two stars, but that's because this book is being compared to other novels by Dickens. If it were by some Victorian unknown, we'd be whooping about a rediscovered goodie! Mostly I enjoyed it, but I doubt very much I'll ever read the first 200 pages or so word-for-word. I should note that I didn't read an edition that had the Penguin editorial notes."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"To be sure, this book does not follow Dickens' normal formula. If you only want to read Dickens' finest books that show his best talents, you may do better to stick with books like &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; or &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; All of that aside, I can not understand why this never gained the same popularity as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which also shows a departure from Dickens' standard formula). The opening is quite captivating and the images are well painted. Right away Dickens grabs our attention with the mysterious 'dead man' (who will later prove to be a VERY significant live person). Like Dickens' other villains, Chester is very wicked, but he carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Geoffrey Haredale is a captivating figure who APPEARS cold, but he proves himself to be quite virtuous. Although we don't really get to know Emma and Dolly that well, they do grab our attention at times. Mary (Barnaby Rudge's mother) is memorable as a (widowed?) woman who does her best for her son and displays her fears dramatically. The 'dead man' reappears every now and then to keep us in suspense. The conversations between Ned and his father Chester are quite memorable. Varden is fine in his secondary but significant role. Barnaby is not exactly Dickens' most memorable protagonist, but he does portray someone caught in the middle fairly well. One thing Dickens does quite well is that he first draws personal disputes over religion, and then he draws civil riots over religious differences. Some memorable lines are also present: (&quot;I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands,&quot; &quot;May he die a violent death as I do now and have the night wind as his only mourner.&quot;). The final fight between Chester and Haredale is a fitting conclusion for this excellent work. So we have a great combination of drama, suspense, horror, and even some comedy. My only complaints about this are that I feel some more time could have been spent on the 'dead man' in developing his character and explaining his actions, and I do miss the filial piety that is prevalent in other novels of Dickens. I do not feel that this represents Dickens' best efforts; but it is FAR from his worst creation. This is every bit as good as the popular &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"When one says &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; and &quot;historical novel&quot; in the same sentence, the immediate impression is of the French Revolution adventure &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. But Dickens wrote another historical novel 18 years before, in 1841, the complex and colorful &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, set during London's anti-Papal riots of June 1780, when there was a reaction against the Catholic influence in Parliament. Populated by a large cast and activated by a plot of intrigue and danger, it is one of the best of Dickens in his early period. In fact, it is perhaps Dickens' most under-rated work. As usual with Dickens, the characters find themselves in a labyrinth of relationships. Sir John Chester is an impoverished habitu&eacute; who tells his handsome son he expects the young man to insure the family fortune in the time-honored tradition of decadent nobility: by marrying money. &quot;With regard to our circumstances, Ned, you may set your mind at rest upon that score. They are desperate.&quot; His son is appalled, the more so as he is in love with Emma, the daughter of a country gentleman, Geoffrey Haredale, Sir John's moral opposite. Running parallel to this love story is that of Joe Willet, the good-hearted son of John Willet, the proprietor of the Maypole Inn, where much of the action takes place. Joe is courting the daughter of Gabriel Varden, an honest, hard-working locksmith, a proletarian hero. (Originally he was the book's title character.) Gabriel's daughter Dolly, Joe's inamorata, is one of those human cookies so adored by Victorian England. (All through the 19th Century articles of clothing were named after her: the Dolly Varden bonnet, the Dolly Varden cape, etc.) Touching these families is Barnaby Rudge himself, a strange, simple-minded boy whose navet&eacute; leads him into joining the rebellion led by the Protestant radical Lord George Gordon, who also appears as a minor character. Barnaby's constant companion is a talking raven; their conversations sound like vaudeville routines. His mother hides one of those dark family mysteries Dickens used so suspensefully in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; and this theme is reflected in Sir John Chester's secret: he is the illegitimate father of ... the story's least likely character. The novel is filled with Dickensian trademarks: ironic drama, an odd sense of humor, and, of course, strong sentimentality. With the bloody Gordon riots as a climax, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, elaborate and absorbing, is an impressive predecessor to Dickens' better-known tale of the Reign of Terror."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Admittedly a lesser known work by Dickens, I found it a great read. Sure, it's a bit slow in the early chapters, but what part of any Dickens work doesn't have its moments. The cast of characters is diverse, as usual, and bring different social circumstances to the Gordon Riots in 1780 England. The chapters devoted to the Riot itself are packed with action that kept me reading far past my normal quitting time. More importantly, Dickens paints a vivid picture of both religious persecution and the irrational and unpredictable quality of a widespread riot. With brief references to the War for Independence, the novel serves as a solid insight into some of the thinking that led our Founding Fathers to enshrine fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights.The academic review that precedes the novel is a waste of time for any reader for enjoyment and a perfect example of the horrid quality of writing in academia today. The reviewer needs to spend less time assembling critical comment and spend some time learning how to write like Dickens."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge is one of Charles Dickens' lesser known and read novels--and that's a pity. The book is interesting, full of the kind of characters that Dickens is noted for, and full of action and exciting scenes. More significantly, it is one of his most thought provoking works, with a relevance that is applicable to today's world. It will leave you cheering for the good guys and grateful to see that the bad guys (and gals) get what coming to them. The book is divided cleanly into two parts, the first taking place in 1775, depicts the comings and goings of four families and their assorted relations and friends. The second occurs five years later and focuses on an historical event, the riots which shook London to oppose rights for Catholics.The book begins at the Maypole, an inn located just outside London and presided over by John Willet, a pompous know-it-all who intimidates his friends and dominates his son, Joe, to the point that he leaves to join the army by the end of this part. Hugh, an uneducated and violent man works for Willet handling animals. Down the road is the residence of Geoffrey Haredale, a country gentleman, and his niece Emma, a beautiful and gracious girl. Her father was mysteriously killed 22 years previously and the mystery runs through the book. Haredale is a Catholic and an antagonist to John Chester, an oily, Machiavellian, highly ambitious character. The only thing the two men have in common is their mutual desire to keep Chester's son Edward from a romance with Emma. In this they succeed and Edward, too, leaves at the end of part 1. The third household contains the Varden family. Gabriel, the father, is a locksmith kindly and a moderating influence throughout the book. Ultimately he plays a hero's role. His wife, Martha, constants nags him, aided and abetted by their servant, Miss Miggs, a comical character given to hysterics. Their daughter, Dolly, is beautiful and vivacious, but flirtatious and at this point does not return the love that Joe Willet shows for her. Simon Tappertit, an apprentice to Mr. Varden, also resides there. He is a ridiculous person with an exaggerated sense of himself and the clandestine leader of a group of similar apprentices with designs on engaging in violence against their masters. Finally there is the residence of the title character, Barnaby Rudge, who is a mentally deficient but happy and charming young man. He lives in genteel poverty with his mother. Mr. Rudge, who was the steward to the murdered Mr. Haredale, was also allegedly a victim. The cast of characters interacts in typical Dickens fashion for the first 33 (of 80) chapters.The scene and mood shifts abruptly in the second part which gives a detailed and graphic account of the so-called \\"anti-popery\\" riots that took place in London in 1780. The reader would do well to read an independent account of these events before reading Dickens' version. The above cast of characters is joined in part two by an additional group including some from actual life (Lord George Gordon, the instigator of the riots and Ned Dennis, one of the ringleaders to name but two). The riots bring out the best and the worst of all the characters. Barnaby is conned into joining the rioters and ends up in prison condemned to be hanged, the Maypole Inn is sacked and John Willet, humiliated, bound and gagged, the Haredale residence is set ablaze and Emma and Dolly taken prisoner, many houses are burned, people killed, Newgate prison is broken into, destroyed and all the prisoners released. The riots end with a harrowing scene is which dozens of people are burned to death by flaming alcohol.The execution scene, where three of the \\"ringleaders\\" are to be hanged is one of the most powerful parts of the book. Dickens gives a vivid account of the conditions and circus atmosphere that surrounds this event. In Hugh's powerful and eloquent speech Dickens also gives a condemnation of British society that creates such persons. Hugh at this point is the most moral person in the book and goes to his death with bravery and courage. This scene alone is well worth reading the book for.In the end, of course, everything is sorted out, justice is delayed but not denied and we have a happy ending.If the book can be said to suffer it is from the lack of a strong central character around whom the plot revolves. There is no real hero here or even a singular villain. Joe and Edward, either of whom might have filled the former role are largely absent from much of the book and only show up again after the riots have ended. Gabriel Varden comes closest to that role but is more acted upon than actor until the closing chapters. The most likely candidate for villain, John Chester, likewise disappears at the end of part one. Hugh, Simon and Dennis emerge as a trio of rouges joined by Gashford, secretary to Lord Gordon and a blind man who cries plaintively, why must I be good just because I am blind? The murderer, of course, is also lurking around. But none of these individuals stands apart from the rest and the hero versus villain theme is muted. The book is really about events and how these events shape and change the life of the characters for better or worse.In the end you will find yourself thinking about Barnaby Rudge for days afterward and it will leave a mark on your life. Nothing more positive can be said about any book."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is the last of all the Dickens's novels (including the five shorter Christmas Books) that I have either read or attempted. I had saved it until the last because it has not been held in very high esteem either by the critics or the reading public. I was pleasantly surprised.Whereas there are several Dickens novels that I was unable to finish (namely, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, Little Dorrit, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and all the Christmas Books except A Christmas Carol), Barnaby Rudge never dragged even though it is one of Dickens's longer novels. Barnaby Rudge is as filled with memorable characters (especially the secondary ones - Miss Miggs, the Vardens, the Chesters, Hugh, Mr. Tappertitt, Dennis the hangman, etc.); places (the Maypole Inn, the locksmith's shop) and incident (the Gordon Riots) as any of his greater novels.Stylistically, Barnaby Rudge is akin to Dickens's earlier picaresque novels (Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby). After those early successes of the 1830s, Dickens was struggling to find his mature style in my opinion. Most of the longer and shorter novels I was unable to finish come from the 1840s. (The Mystery of Edwin Drood is Dickens's last novel, but it was only half-finished at his death so it is really not fair to blame Dickens for my failure to respond to it.) Even though The Old Curiosity Shop comes between Nicholas Nickelby and Barnaby Rudge, Barnaby Rudge demonstrates all the strengths of Nicholas Nickelby and avoids the weaknesses of The Old Curiosity Shop. Barnaby Rudge is still early Dickens in my opinion.G. K. Chesterton described a taste for early Dickens as similar to a taste for new potatoes as opposed to mature potatoes. Some people prefer new potatoes. Barnaby Rudge is not Dickens at his greatest. (I reserve that description for David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Bleak House. Along with the three novels of the 1830s already mentioned, I place Hard Times, A Tale of Two Cities and Our Mutual Friend and now, Barnaby Rudge, on the second tier of Dickens's novels.) We must remember, that Dickens at his worst is better than most writers at their best. If Barnaby Rudge were a newly discovered work by an otherwise unknown author, or by one of Dickens's contemporaries, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. As it is, Barnaby Rudge is an eminently enjoyable and readable effort by a great writer."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time after about twenty years. Dickens is a writer to be read slowly so that you can enjoy the feast of language, atmosphere, characters and plot. If its not Dickens' greatest, so what?"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I began to read Charles Dickens when I was in my teen years. There is very few authors with such incite in to human character, and the ability to paint a scene that puts our current crop of authors to shame. The present day secular media from film, and books can never compete with a genius for the true art of literature. There are some authors today that might present a popular novel but they usually fall flat and unfulfilling once the book is read. There are always a few whose talent trancend politics, sensuality, and sensationalism. When you get tired of popularism Dickens is the author that fills your mind with memorable scenes and characters who go beyond the present politically correct novel. Dickens brings to life the morality, nobleness, and virtues that an author who lives beyond his century passes on. This novel is one of those that will be one that you will read again, maybe even more than a couple of times. G.K. Chesterton wrote the most profound and honest critisms of Dickens works. I suggest reading Chesterton for incite into Dickens. Barnaby Rudge could be a good start for a reading habit of honestly absorbing and entertaining literature. Put Patterson or Clancy aside and learn to enjoy the talent that will out live both of them."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Dickens' first historical fiction, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is not a big favorite either with Dickens fans or with critics, largely because of its curious lack of the divinely memorable characters for which Dickens is usually known. (There are some good characters, but not the all-star cast we come to expect from the master.) Be this as it may, there's no denying that the buildup and eruption of the Gordon riots in London offer us some of Dickens' most compelling writing. Once the riots finally begin, they sweep us along in a torrent of demonic energy that is suitably appalling to the reader. For this reason, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is certainly worth reading. Even &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; does not conjure the same breathless chaos as &quot;Rudge&quot; does. Also, though it is one of Dickens' earlier books, it has much more evidence of structured planning than do more improvised works such as &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop.&quot; Dickens would not truly master the art of creating a well-rounded novel in serial installments until &quot;Dombey and Son,&quot; but he is clearly on the right track here."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This work by Dickens takes the factual events of the &quot;No Popery&quot; riots of 1780's London,England and uses them as a backdrop for a dozen or so of Dicken's most colorful and well contrasted characters and combines with them a plot that includes a long unsolved murder. The reader can expect the usual thoroughly desciptive scenes, long a hallmark of his writing style, and characters that seem to come to life,jumping as it were, right from the very page. It is a pleasure,not a chore, to read Barnaby Rudge."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"For someone whose favourite literary period is the 19th Century, I have a confession to make. I am 43 years old (young!) and Barnaby Rudge is the first Charles Dickens novel I have ever been able to finish. I had previously made attempts on Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Hard Times and never got passed more than a couple of chapters in any one of them. Perhaps it was due to having hitherto had many great expectations and more than a few hard times? Who knows?!When I saw that The Complete Works of Charles Dickens was available on Kindle for less that 2.00 I downloaded it and was then left with the decision as to which of his novels I should try first. I went for Barnaby Rudge as I liked the name. Simple as that. I knew nothing about the book, not even, as it transpired, the length of it. That's one of the negative points of reading a book on Kindle - particularly when it is part of a collection. It was only after reading it for a month or so that I decided to check out the length in paperback - 744 pages. For one who had decided to regularly read and post reviews I guess a novel of such length was not a good choice. But by that time, it was too late to stop reading, not least because I was absolutely in love with the book.So where to begin? Barnaby Rudge was apparently scheduled to be Dickens' first published novel but due to various issues including a change of publisher it was originally published in weekly installments from February 1841 to November 1841 in a magazine he edited called Master Humphrey's Clock. By all accounts it is not renowned as being one of his best and there have only been two attempts to dramatise it - once in a 1915 silent movie and again in an early 1960's TV serialisation. To be honest, had I known of these facts before, I would still have chosen it to be the first of his novels I would read all the way through. I do love an underdog!For me, the novel felt like I was engaged in three different art forms. The first third is like wandering around an art gallery, taking in the scenes, observing a time where the world was slower, less intense. The second is like watching an action film - fast paced, frantic, disturbing and entirely enthralling. The final third is akin to watching a series of vignettes on stage - the resolution of each of the many plot strands. This one man audience applauded and left the theatre sighing and fulfilled.The central theme of the novel is how people cope when faced with emotional conflict - whether that be thwarted love, a lusting for a higher station in life, a desire for money or a desire for power. The first third of the novel sets up the conflicts and the central third imposes the incredible anarchy initiated (somewhat unknowingly it must be said) by Lord Gordon's attempts to rail against the Papist Act of 1778. Each of the main characters are caught up in the riots and each is changed by the way they decide to react to them. As you would expect, there are heroes and villains, deceit, wonder and disaster. The description of the riots is absolutely stunning and I could not help but think of the riots in London last year. Over 200 years separates each event yet Charles Dickens' account far exceeds anything I read in any newspaper a year ago. I was moved, appalled and entirely dumbstruck by the connection. I defy anyone not to react in a similar way.The structure of Barnaby Rudge reminded me of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo (1862) - the extensive scenes depicting the Battle of Waterloo substituting the Gordon Riots; and the character of Miggs was very redolent of Miss Clack in The Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins. Other than A Tale of Two Cities, Barnaby Rudge was the only novel Charles Dickens wrote that wasn't set in the 19th Century and there is a feeling of nostalgia in it that perhaps is hard to feel about his 19th Century novels. I have recently begun reading Nicholas Nickleby so I can certainly attest to the fact that his anger against the education system, capitalism and greed is certainly not depicted with any form of sentiment!So overall, having read Barnaby Rudge, I am full of awe, admiration, joy and humility. William Blake is my ultimate literary hero - Charles Dickens, even after having just read one of his novels (a largely forgotten one at that) is already running him a close second."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I'm a little chagrined to admit that this was the first work by Dickens I'd ever read (no, not even \\"Christmas Carol'), but I'm thrilled to say that I loved the book. I went in, not knowing anything about the novel..I'd never even heard of it, which is why I picked it..and was immediately drawn to the characters and the complex, swirling plot. The history of the period..of which I must honestly admit I was aware, beforehand..made the book even more fascinating.This Dickens guy: he has a bright future ahead of him."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I must agree with a number of other reviewers here...don't start your reading of Dickens with this one, but once you start, you need to add this one to your list. This is not one of Dickens' most noted works, but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer. I had the pleasure (?) of first reading this one in a volume, years ago, which was printed in the late 1800s and which was printed for mass distribution. Fine print, two columns per page, printing all the way to the page edge...you get the picture. That was years ago...I am too old to even see the print now, much less read it, but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that I can afford a nicer copy. The work can be criticized, with some justification, for being a bit wordy, but for my taste, that is one of the charms of the novel. It certainly fits the times and the style of the times. Recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the Dickens thing."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Let me open with a quote from the book:&quot;On the skull of one drunken lad -- not twenty, by his looks -- who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white hot; melting his head like wax.&quot;You think Edgar Allen Poe to be the king of horror? Meet the author who far surpasses him in making flesh creep and cringe, in this book more than most. In Barnaby Rudge, Dickens portrays the Gordon Riots, a violent anti-Catholic outburst in London in 1780, supposedly started by the opposition by Lord Gordon to some acts in Parliament which would've relieved some of the burdens of Catholic citizens: the right to directly inherit property and the right to educate their children in England. As usual, Dickens ignores the political pressures, likely brought about by the French allying themselves with the Americans in their colonial war, which would've stirred up suspicions of Anglo-Catholics being in league with the French.In any case, I can see why this book has never matched the popularity of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, as there is no possibility for heroes in scenes of mob violence. Even those who refuse to cooperate with the rioters can do little more than resist. Locksmith Gabriel Varden, being forcibly brought to Newgate prison, refuses to pick the lock for the masses of rowdy men intending to free their comrades and anyone else locked inside; however, his resistence means little as the mob decides to burn down the door instead. Mr. Haredale is often defiant, but he can do little more than beat a retreat when faced by hundreds of belligerent men. None of this &quot;'Tis a far, far better thing...&quot; kind of statement which can be made.Ignore the plot lines. They are cursory, even for Dickens. They are there merely to set up the characters and their own personal motivations so one can see what happens to them when all order dissolves. I could see why the English of Dickens' day may have not wanted to read this book -- it was far too scary, especially as Dickens portraying the fuel to the rioters' fire being the primal urges to destruction and looting. Though there was then (in 1841) a better policing force and better prisons, there still was the unbearable poverty and dissipation alive in London. Then, as now, there were plenty ripe to take advantage of any opportunity to set fire to the town. Think the actions in here too far-fetched for even these times? Consider the fires, destruction, and looting that start in any modern city, once rioters have been given an opening.People are crushed underfoot, men are consumed by the very fires they had set, and decent people stand by because they are powerless in the face of the massive wave of violence. Dickens shirks not one detail. If you're thinking of a quaint Victorian period piece, for crying out loud, don't read this book! Go read Pickwick Papers or Old Curiosity Shop. However, if you enjoy this kind of disaster, by all means, read Barnaby Rudge (or might I suggest Hard Times, which has some pretty horrific deaths)."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is a review of the BBC Radio dramatization version of this book.The story is a good one, filled with politics of religion, sympathetic characters and Dicken's inimitable prose.However, this audio version is WAY over produced, with blaring, overly-dramatic music that seemed reminiscent of the worst grade B silent films.The actors screamed, ranted, raved and wept hysterically more than they spoke. Unless someone already knows the basic plot and characters, they may have difficulty following the action (particularly, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the thick accents will be hard for Americans to decipher.).The entire production needed to be toned down quite a bit for Dicken's voice to be heard above the clamor.It might be better to read the book in this case."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I am a Dickens fan.

Speaking of which, there were entirely too many villains, and they got a bit difficult to keep straight!That being said, when the book did pick up, I found it very difficult to put down. Dickens develops this terrifying, fixating painting of mob mentality. The fire, the attacks on the prison are truly gripping. I just wish we could have gotten to the interesting parts a bit sooner. :)"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Considering it's lack of prominence in Dickens' catalogue, \\"Barnaby Rudge\\" proved a surprisingly good read. A clear-eyed and somewhat personal look at the Gordon Riots, it lacks the idealisation of events and characters that pervades his other historical work, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" - and is the better for it. Certainly a book that for readability if nothing else deserves more attention."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"It surprises me that this is actually one of the lesser known works of Dickens. The truth is that this book displays some of Dickens's strongest writing. We start with some people recalling the horrible murder on 'the 19th of March.' (Undoubtedly, the Ides of March from Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\" was revolving in Dickens's head.) These characters talk of Geoffrey Haredale and his niece Emma. (Emma's father and Geoffrey's brother was the murder victim on 'the 19th of March.')Throughout the story, Dickens maintains the tone of suspense with the fear and presence of the 'dead man.' Perhaps one of the greatest things about this book is that at first Dickens talks of hatred between religions on a personal level, and then it is brought to a massive level. Well, Geoffrey Haredale and John Chester meet, and we can see that they DO NOT like each other. But they do agree that they don't want John's son to marry Geoffrey's niece Emma. So they will work together to prevent it. Haredale and Chester display yet another aspect of Dickens's writing. Dickens knows how to prevent characters from being either 100 % likable or detestable. (Unlike Hollywood!) Haredale is cold, uptight, and stern, but he is virtuous. Chester is vain, self serving, and dishonest. But he carries a charm that makes him likable in spite of this.Well, we soon learn that John Chester and his son are not too fond of each other. Though especially with modern goals, it is hard to disagree with John Chester when he says: \\"All men are fortune hunters.\\" Later, Gabriel Varden's daughter is grabbed by Maypole. (Eventually we learn that Maypole is John Chester's illegitimate son.) His actions would seem to indicate a relationship to John Chester.Later, we learn that the 'dead man' is Barnaby Rudge's father. He makes a visit to Mary (Barnaby's mother). She is frightened of him, but she does provide some relief. Later, Haredale suspects that the man who killed his brother may not be so far away. Moving on, Chester and Haredale succeed in preventing the marriage they wanted to stop, though Haredale does regret the dishonesty involved. This is followed by the complete alienation of John Chester and his son Edward. (Though if we think the thing about keeping people of different religions or from certain families from marrying is a thing of the past, we should THINK AGAIN!)Moving on, a huge Protestant rally begins to form with the intent of destroying Catholic property. (So, Dickens has shown us religious bigotry on a personal level, and then he raises it to a massive level. Good job Charles!) Maypole decides to join this rally. Well, we once again meet Mary and Barnaby. They are visited by a blind man, and it doesn't take much for us to know who the blind man is friends with. (Rudge Sr.)Mary and Barnaby see the Protestant rally, and Barnaby being somewhat naive can not resist joining them. (Though we should be aware that getting people to join a dangerous rally with a few simple words that appeal to a primitive instinct is not all that difficult.) Moving on, Gabriel Varden's Dolly and Haredale's niece Emma are kidnapped in the rally. Later, Rudge Sr. is taken by Haredale. (Young Barnaby as well.) Rudge Sr. does express some regret for his past crimes. His blind friend says that all may not be lost. If his wife declares her husband dead (as many people believe)then Rudge Sr. should get off. In an at least partially touching scene, Rudge Sr. and Barnaby meet, and Rudge Sr. reveals that he is Barnaby's father.Later, against his will, Varden is forced to help the prisoners escape. And Barnaby Sr and Jr know freedom once more. Haredale is injured, and he later finds out that Edward Chester helped him. Poor Sr. Rudge finds his wife will not help him, and to make matters worse, his blind friend is killed. Rudge Sr. is understandably in a rage when he sees his former wife, and we can't blame him completely when she essentially left him to be hanged.In a bit of fierce Dickens's comical style, Dennis the Hangman is arrested and is frightened of who his cell mate may be. But peace is made between Maypole and Dennis. (What's the point of fighting when we are all going to hang anyway?) In a redeeming moment, Dennis tells Maypole of his past and who is parents were. One would think Chester would want to make peace with his doomed illegitimate son, but Maypole has outlived his usefulness to John Chester. In a redeeming moment, Maypole says that he would lay down his life willingly if it would save Barnaby. In an articulate line, Maypole goes out with hatred for his father: \\"I leave the wish that he die a violent death as I do now, and have the night wind for his only mourner.\\"In a sad scene, Haredale admits his faults and leaves Edward and Emma free to marry. 2 lovers coming together is usually a happy ending. But in this case, it seems to take a back seat to the sadness of Haredale. Haredale and Chester have their final fight, and Chester does go out in style. Though poor Haredale only lives a short while longer.But all is not dark. Barnaby is reunited with his mother, and his pet bird can speak again. True, \\"Barnaby Rudge\\" is quite different from the popular works like \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"A Tale of two Cities.\\" But in this case some differences turned out to be a great thing! Don't be put off because this is a more obscure work of Dickens. You'll miss out!"},{"Title":"The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work, and Ministry in Biblical Perspective","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation from a friend. I have been looking for a book that would give a theological framework to what is now called the &quot;marketplace movement&quot;. I was also looking for a book to encourage bussiness people and university students that their &quot;work&quot; is of real significance to God. I have not been dissapointed.What is significant about &quot;The Other Six days&quot; is it's approach. This is not a popular critque of the seperation between work and worship, mission and ministry, clergy and laity. Instead it reconstructs a unifying theology welling up out of scripture, flowing out of the Trininty providing a paradigm of vocation, work, ministry and mission as an intergrated whole. The outcome is all the people of God participate in the Trinities work, mission and ministry.The book is broken into three parts. Part 1 A people without &quot;Laity and Clergy&quot; Part 2 Summoned and equipped by God and Part 3 For the life of the world.Each part traces ideas down through the church\`s history which now discolour our thinking and practice on the issues addressed. Secondly the contemporary context is explored. The author then gets under the skin of these issues through sound biblical exgesis and an applied theology of the Trinity.What resulted for me is a dynamic new way of understanding &quot;calling&quot; , work, ministry and mission. It has revitalised my understanding of the church and its work in society.I found the discussion questions at the end of each chapter to be excellent. There are readings to examine, contemporary case studies to explore, situations to evaluate and examples to analyse. These are excellent for group or individual study, reflection and interaction.If you are wanting to explore further the issues the book has raised the author provides a fantastic selected bibliograhy, index of authors, biblical references and subjects. The footnotes also provde a rich source for further research.Overall I'm deeply impacted by the thought, devotion and reflection which has gone into this book. I fully recommend it to anyone wanting to grapple with the intergration of faith and daily life."},{"Title":"The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work, and Ministry in Biblical Perspective","review":"R. Paul Stevens uses this book to step back from common assumptions about Christian life and re-assess how all of God's people contribute value to his kingdom.Stevens' major argument is that there should be no high separation between clergy and laity within the church. To clarify: he recognizes different gifts and roles, and by all means the pastor should be the pastor and the janitor should be the janitor; but before God they are qualitatively the same, rather than one being an 'ordained position' that God can really use, and the other a lay position that's only out there so that the ordained guy can do what really matters.Stevens treats this topic quite extensively. He examines the scriptures and finds no support for distiction between layity and clery within the new testament, and thoughtfully considers the implications of the old testament structures for the new testament. He then looks at different points within the early Fathers and subsequent church history and analyses how a distinction of clergy developed; his obvious implication is that it shouldn't have.Stevens spends a fair amount of thought on a person's calling and ordination. There is much that would be valuable for the church to consider here. A sampling of thoughts:* If we ordain people that live out their Christian work as pastors, let us also ordain people that live out their Christian work in other roles: let us ordain the salesperson to be a salesperson to the glory of God as he ethically promotes commerce, the painter be a painter to the glory of God as he explores meaning and creates beauty, the farmer, the manager, the home maker ...* The call to be a pastor is typically not a mystical experience; the Damascus road experience of Paul was the exception, not the norm. Rather, the normative call to a leadership role in a church in the New Testament was from \\"the church\\" itself (Stevens doesn't delve into considering Presbyterian vs. Episcopal governance). Why do we not still do this, and train those so called by the church, rather than youth go off to seminary based on their own whim before they are even mature enough for military service?Stevens never outlines his underlying worldview, but you can pick some of it up from clues as you read. He doesn't give enough clues to pick up his denomination (though what he says clearly rules several out). His views include those...* fairly consensual among the church (e.g., covenant theology), to others* immaterial to the topic (e.g., he never discusses it, but one chart implies he is a pre-millenialist), to others* controversial (e.g., that the church should be no distinction between men and women, in the process stating -- without providing any rationale -- that Junia was an apostle. Thankfully, in the news as I write this review, it is in the news that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger is defending us from that one with an encyclical!)As the book nears the end, Stevens introduces lots of ideas around living out life in the world.This scattering of ideas is presented without a uniting framework, and the ideas themselves are not fully developed within the text. The topics he addresses are reasonably abstact -- there are certainly no simplistic \\"7-steps-to-such-and-such\\" that curse much popular writing. As typical treatment of a topic, he describes options for approach to political involvement, ranging from Anabaptist to Theology of Liberation, in a couple pages; elsewhere he provides out-of-the-blue a quote about \\"red, green, and white martyrdom\\" from \\"the medieval celtic church\\" with no surrounding evaluative comments. Some of the many ideas throughout the book I found through provoking, and others off the wall.This is a good book to read if the reader to come at it with a \\"testing the spirits\\" attitude. After the well-worked-out treatment of the topic of clergy / layity non-separation, Stevens' ideas are quickly introduced without rigourous thought. I found some of the biblical citations that he uses are invalid - read in context, they don't actually support the point he is making. (But then, that's too common a fault in most treatises!) Use this as an opportunity to initiate thoughts down new paths where the idea warrants it, under guidance of scripture and prayer. This is I think in fact Stevens' intention: the book is not intended to fully answer every questions, but rather contains case studies and probing questions of its own (at the end of each chapter) to stimulate the reader to think further for himself -- or herself, as Stevens would be certain to complete the phrase."},{"Title":"The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work, and Ministry in Biblical Perspective","review":"In The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work and Ministry in Biblical Perspective, Paul Stevens addresses the subject of theology for the Christian life. He aims to give a comprehensive biblical foundation for the Christian's life in the world as well as the church by developing three particular aspects of Christian theology: vocation, work and ministry. His audience ranges from the \\"ordinary\\" Christian, untrained in academic theology, to historians and theologians alike. From the start, he makes it clear that he is looking to engage those who are interested in wrestling with what it looks like to be a follower of Jesus here and now, both at home and in the workplace. Even his title - The Other Six Days - reveals his desire to explore biblically whether or not all of life, apart from Sunday or Sabbath, is infused with meaning. His main contention is that the conventional way in which the clergy and laity are distinguished, which he argues emerged from history in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, deepened from the 4th to 16th centuries, and remained through the Reformation even until today, must be abolished and instead a new understanding of \\"the whole people of God\\" must be constructed using a full Trinitarian approach.In the proposal of his ideas, there are at least four assumptions from which Stevens is arguing his points. First, he is writing in response to what he believes to be an unbalanced and fragmented theology for the Christian life that needs to be unified. Second, he is dissatisfied with similar attempts that deal only with Christians while at church; rather Stevens is interested in translating the word of God into situations where people live and work, including the \\"menial, the trivial and the necessary.\\" Third, he believes that there are some theologians who have made somewhat successful attempts at developing this kind of all-encompassing theology, and he intends to build upon them. Finally, he assumes all theology is practical, and despite the separation of theology from practice since the 11th century, he argues tenaciously that theology as a way of living must be fully recovered.The first part of Steven's book is dedicated to a deconstruction of the conventional ways in which laity and clergy are seen. By comparing what exists in most churches today - two classes of people separated by education, ordination and intonation - against the various biblical portrayals of the people of God, and by highlighting some of the negative ramifications of making a clergy-laity distinction, Stevens illustrates the need to reconsider how the people of God should be viewed. He argues from Scripture there is nothing to suggest that Jesus has delegated his authority to certain church members who have responsibility for the ministry of others, and instead the people of God are better seen as \\"one ministering people with leaders whose role it is to serve.\\" Stevens concludes the first section by basing his theology on a Trinitarian understanding of God, where the people of God, like the Godhead, don't just contribute but actually share in the ministry. For this reason, he argues that the people of God relate best as a community with roles but without hierarchy.In the second part of the book Stevens develops this theology, using the Trinitarian approach, in the order prescribed in the subtitle - vocation, work and then ministry. First, given the biblical use of the word \`calling,' he argues for an understanding of God's call, or vocation, to individuals not as a call to a career, a situation in life or even a particular church-related vocation, but instead as a call: to belong to God (communion); to be God's people (community-building); and to do God's work (co-creativity). Second, by reminding the reader of the \`not yet' and \`here and now' aspects of salvation found in the Scriptures, he shows not only how human work can have significance both in this life and in the life to come, but also how work itself has intrinsic value any time it seeks to partner with God in his work of saving souls and maintaining and developing the earth. Third, he asserts that a Trinitarian theology of ministry requires that ministry, or service, be seen as \\"the expression of the relational love life of the triune God through the whole people of God in the empowering presence of the Spirit.\\"In the third and final portion of his book, Stevens offers a restructuring of the church based on these new understandings of vocation, work and ministry. His council ranges from the dynamics of church leadership to how the church should respond to both natural and supernatural resistance. Above all else in this section, he argues for a revitalization of the true meaning of \`mission,' which, he observes, has tragically declined since the 16th century to mean human outreach. Tracing the concept of mission through the Bible, he argues for an understanding of mission as \\"what God is doing to bless all the nations through the resurrection of Christ\\" and for the church's involvement in this mission by bringing in the Kingdom here and now.Stevens is effective in helping the reader understand the historical and cultural factors that have shaped modern thinking on the subject of vocation, work and ministry, and his Trinitarian approach is both balanced and timely. It is balanced in the sense that all three members of the Godhead are involved in his holistic understanding of vocation and ministry, and timely in the sense that there are many pastors to whom this book will inform and assist tremendously. Although he does not succeed in developing a comprehensive biblical foundation for the Christian life in the world and in the church because, referring to his own diagram of the dimensions of Christian vocation , some major components of the Christian life, such as rest (Sabbath), personal spirituality, neighbor, and family, are left theologically undeveloped, nonetheless Stevens does succeed in establishing a foundation upon which these facets can later be explored.I believe this is an important book for our time and culture. Amidst many local churches where not only the clergy-laity divide still exists but continues to be enthusiastically encouraged, Steven's work is a tactful critique of a body of belief that simply needs to be reformed. His theology is well thought out, and his message is relevant not only for those who are wondering exactly how all of their life can be fused with meaning but also for those who have not yet realized it."},{"Title":"The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work, and Ministry in Biblical Perspective","review":"I came to read Dr. Stevens book as one who did not realize the extent to which I had dichotomistic thinking in my approach to deeds. I will be the first to admit that I am a beginner theologian who happens to work in the marketplace. So, as an untrained theologian I just made it through the book (but the word &quot;just&quot; is not meant to discourage anyone).The reading, first and foremost, challenged my definition of mission. I realized that the posture of my heart is more than doing deeds (evangelizing, etc). In the book I can remember reading (and I paraphrase) &quot;you can preach on the corner with a prideful heart, or do computer programming to the glory of God, what is more pleasing to God?&quot; These types of statements combined with a sound trinitarian perspective of work, helped reshape my thinking.Yet after reading the book for the last two years I have sought more answers. I have begun skimming through the book again to begin to answer some of my questions. For instance, in practice, I have tried to not solely validate people's occupation based on the good it produces to society. This is tough... In actuality, in engaging the marketplace in how they perceive work, the horizontal (God and your work), should be introduced and flushed out as the primary motivator and paradigm through which Christians in the marketplace should view their work, RATHER than how much time they have to evangelize, how many people they employ, etc. This is a real struggle, and I seek answers on how to present a theology that is practical and can be communicated easily and effectively to the average follower of Christ. So, consider that a request for &quot;A dummies guidebook on how to flush out a theology of work in the life of the church.&quot;Well done Dr. Stevens!"},{"Title":"The Other Six Days: Vocation, Work, and Ministry in Biblical Perspective","review":"This book gives excellent Scriptural reasons for WORK being WORSHIP.

Montgomery's books featuring Anne Shirley (especially the first installment, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\") are without question the most famous and beloved series by this gifted author. But many of her fans consider the \\"New Moon\\" trilogy starring Emily Byrd Starr Montgomery's best work, partly because of its autobiographical nature. Like Emily, Montgomery herself struggled for recognition in the literary world.When the sequels to \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" were written (after the popularity of the first book made publishers urge Montgomery to write sequels) they were done without any \`master-plan' in place to chronicle Anne's life experiences. As such, they read more as an ongoing serial in which the role of Anne gradually peters out as her she is replaced by her daughter Rilla as the protagonist of the series. Although the books are beautifully written, there is a sense that (with a few obvious exceptions, such as Anne's romance and subsequent marriage to Gilbert Blythe) Montgomery simply made them up as she went along.That is clearly not the case with the \\"New Moon\\" trilogy, in which each book is built on the previous installment, and several plot points such as Emily's familial ties, romances, friendships, education, physic gifts, and - most importantly - her ambitions as a writer are developed throughout the three books into a coherent whole. Anne's story trails along, Emily's has a structured arc.This leads to the next big difference between the two heroines: like Emily, Anne had the desire and skills to follow a literary career, one she eventually gives up in order to become a wife and mother. There is none of this for Emily Starr - she was born to be a writer, and every other subplot of the book (even her romantic entanglements) are secondary in the story to her desire to become an author. Anne's goodness and cheerfulness make her a great role model, but Emily's ambitions in what was still predominantly a man's world are truly inspirational.Emily lives an idyllic existence with her beloved father in the country, when she is cruelly told by the family housekeeper that her father has only a few more weeks to live. By chapter three she is an orphan, and to be adopted out to her mother's people, the stern and powerful Murray clan. After an awkward family reunion, Emily is taken in by her Aunt Elizabeth, a strict and somewhat unkind woman who has no idea how to deal with the young girl now in her care. The two quickly form a distrust and dislike of each other, despite Emily's repore with Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy who also live with Elizabeth at New Moon. At her new home there is plenty to keep her occupied: new friends to make, new countryside to explore and thousands of stories to hear and tell. Emily soon realises that her calling in life is to be a writer, and here we see her take the first steps (and missteps) toward her lofty goal.Furthermore, she soon makes three dear friends: the quiet and artistic Teddy, the mischievous Perry and the tomboy Ilse. These three friends are Emily's companions throughout the three books, though even here there is trouble brewing; romantic entanglements will inevitably arise in later books. Emily is also accorded unique physic abilities that manifest themselves once in every book; and I won't say anymore about that considering discovery the secret to the terrible mystery at the heart of Ilse's story is one of the best parts of the book. There is a spirituality and mysticism present in the \\"Emily\\" books that is somewhat missing from the domesticity of the Anne books: discussions on the nature of God, the legitimacy of other belief structures, and a palpable sense of the other-world. And - as is Montgomery's way - the story is littered with family anecdotes and letters/diary entries by Emily herself.Even those who do consider the Emily books Montgomery's greater achievement (including myself) will often still look upon the Anne books as more *enjoyable*. Compared to Anne, Emily's ongoing story is darker, grimmer, and at times even downright creepy. Unlike Anne who is orphaned as a baby, Emily must bear the full brunt of the grief that comes from a beloved parent dying and the abandonment issues that follow. Furthermore, Emily is surrounded by cast of characters who are considerably darker than Anne's extended family and friends. The stern but loving Marilla is replaced by the severe and strict Elizabeth and Emily has a much more difficult time at school, what with a sadistic schoolteacher and a betrayal from a false friend. Other associates also have darker sides to them; the otherworldly Cousin Jimmy who is hinted as having a mental disorder (due to the fact Elizabeth accidentally pushed him down the well in a fit of temper - yikes!), the intelligent but secretive Dean Priest whose hold over Emily will become more pronounced as the series continues, and Emily's proud and autocratic Murray family. There is only one truly \\"safe\\" character, and that is Aunt Laura. But despite her kindness and gentleness, she and Emily are not kindred spirits, for as Emily herself says at one point: \\"You can love someone without understanding them.\\" (And toward the end of the book there is a lovely moment in which Elizabeth comes through for Emily in a way that Laura does not).You can never get quite comfortable in the Emily books, especially not in the way you do with Anne. The Anne stories are too rich to be passed off as escapist flights of fancy - but when compared to Emily, they come rather close. Anne had a temper, but was otherwise the picture of perfection: generous, warm, golden-hearted. Emily on the other hand is a much more rounded character, with plenty of flaws to balance out her virtues. She is much more standoffish than Anne, and makes friends less easily (though once made she is the most devoted companion one could wish for). Where Anne was hot-tempered, Emily is haughty, where Anne was talkative, Emily is thoughtful, where Anne was easy-going, Emily is somewhat prideful. Some have complained it is easier to like Anne than it is to like Emily. To them I say: \\"Duh!\\" Montgomery is not looking to create another Anne, but a character that is completely different from her most famous orphan.I come to the end of this review and find that it is simply a comparison between \\"New Moon\\" and \\"Green Gables\\". I didn't set out to do that, but I think that in doing so one might be better prepared to approach Emily and her story. Anne Shirley came from L. M.

Along with the Anne series and The Story Girl, they represent the best of LM Montgomery's fiction. Emily is similar in many ways to Anne (and to many of Montgomery's characters) - highly imaginative, sensitive, smart, a little different, an orphan, ambitious. She also has a darker side that Anne never displays; where Anne is impulsive and quick to forgive, Emily is intense and proud and holds grudges, sometimes for years. In some ways, her story is more developed than Anne's, and certainly at least as engaging.As a child, I identified strongly with Emily; now, as an adult, I still find her one of the most interesting and complex characters Montgomery has written. (Although the poetry makes one cringe at times.) I highly recommend this book to girls of all ages, but especially to those in the 10-14-year-old set who may think about \\"deeper\\" things than the silly crushes and dramas that enthrall their peers."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is the best book ever written by LM in my opinion. It is, in many ways, very different from her other books. It contains elements of horror and deep emotion not introduced in her other novels. Emily herself is the most unique, thoroughly developed character and is by far the most inspirational character I can think of. This book makes you want to get up and do wonderful things, but you can't because you won't put the book down! My own copy is yellowed and dog-eared from years of reading and re-reading it, and each time I do I discover something else new and wonderful about the plot, the many sub-plots, and the characters. This book has incredible depth, and is clean of any filth or meaningless words. It is a treasure in paper and ink, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful, captivating, suspence-filled literature. I'm 15 now and have read it about twice a year since I got it, and twice a year have been overwhelmed with the power and joy that fills it's pages. I also recommend the other sequels to this book. They are just as great as the first! P.S. I sure would have loved to see that TV series!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"The Emily of New Moon series is hands down, my favourite piece of children's literature. I first read them at age 9 or 10 when my brother gave them to me as a Christmas present and I've read them dozens of times since.It's unfortunate that so many times when we talk about Emily, it's to compare her to Anne. She can certainly stand on her own. But lots of the plot elements are the same: strong-willed orphan girl finds her way into the heart of confirmed bachelor and old maid(s). However, Emily is a more sophisticated character (and as an avid Anne addict, it pains me to say that.) She's is not the delightful Pollyanna that Anne was - she has some character flaws. Sometimes she's overly stubborn or overly proud. She has a lot of the characteristics I had as an eleven year old; perhaps that's why she's become such a favourite of mine.There are some darker aspects in this book too that readers of Montgomery's short stories will recognize: a near-death experience and an element of the supernatural.I found Emily's relationships more realistic too. She is taunted at school on the first day; she wonders if her Aunt Elizabeth loves her. Most children have the relationships that Emily had, ones that are passionate and loving, but often frustrating as well.The second and third books are even better prove as Emily's complicated love life evolves and her dreams of being a writer continue to elude her.If you're a parent I urge you to give these books to your children. I feel so glad I read them when I was young because Emily had a bit of a harder time of life, but still managed to be incredibly happy. For children who haven't yet met their real-life Diana Barrys or Gilbert Blythes, I highly recommend that they meet the fictional Emily Starr of New Moon.If you're an adult, you might find these books highly comforting too. I know I still like to read them on rainy days when the world is feeling a little harder than usual. The familiar style and the picturesque atmosphere are sure to comfort."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read Emily of New Moon 17 years ago, when I was ten years old. I have never gotten her out of my head. In fact, I have even visited Prince Edward Island to see the place that was the setting for so many of LMM's stories. I would recommend this book to women of all ages."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I read the &quot;Emily&quot; series for the first time when I was 12. It touched something deep inside of me. My father had just died, and I too wanted more than anything to be a writer. Emily spoke to me; her girlish wisdom echoed, so eloquently, the struggles I was going through at that time. It was the first time I ever felt kin to a character in a book, instead of admiring them from the sidelines. I've re-read this series countless times; whenever I'm depressed or feel as if I've lost touch with my self. Each time I read it, it's like visiting old friends and family, and I'm still finding insight and comfort within the dog eared pages. I'm going on 23 years old now, and I'm in the process of having my first novel published. Lucy Maud Montgomery has been a constant source of inspiration to me, a mother figure to my literary aspirations. She has given me a beautiful gift, and I hope you find as much joy in her stories as I have. Always; Emily"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After finishing Anne of Green Gables, I decided to pick up another L. M. Montgomery book. I was all set to pick up another Anne book, but then I found Emily of New Moon. I decided to try this book, to see if L. M. Montgomery could capture the beauty of words in another novel. She did.Emily of New Moon tells the story of young Emily Byrd Starr, who is left an orphan at the tender age of eleven. Her mother's family draws lots to decide who should take Emily in, and the lot fell to the Murrays of New Moon. Stern Aunt Elizabeth, loving Aunt Laura, and simple Cousin Jimmy brought Emily to New Moon Farm, where she had all sorts of adventures and basically just learned the lessons of life. Emily is a young heroine who many can relate to.L. M. Montgomery has written another beautiful novel. Emily's character is well-developed and lifelike, and New Moon seemed just like a real place to me. For anyone who is looking for a real piece of literature, Emily of New Moon or any of L. M. Montgomery's other works are the books for you!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After the beloved \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" books the next longest series penned by L. M. Montgomery would be the \\"Emily of New Moon\\" Trilogy. This first volume was written in 1923, with \\"Emily Climbs\\" being published in 1925 and \\"Emily's Quest\\" in 1927. These works were all written after Montgomery had finished her initial run of the \\"Anne\\" books, which ended with \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\" in 1920 (Montgomery would not expand that series until years later, writing \\"Anne of Windy Poplars\\" in 1936 and \\"Anne of Ingleside\\" in 1939). Consequently, Montgomery was able to focus on the Emily books, with only \\"The Blue Castle,\\" her one \\"adult\\" romance, written in 1926, intervening.Although the major thread of the three books is how Emily Starr learns to become a successful writer, that element is a minor one in this first book. Once again, Montgomery presents us with a spirited orphan who has to live with her mother's relatives after her father dies (although Emily is young and less mature than Anne Shirley). But the twist here is that nobody wants Emily and it is only out a sense of duty that they make the young girl draw lots to see where she will live. Emily ends up with Elizabeth Murray, her mother's sister, at New Moon Farm on Prince Edward Island. Aunt Elizabeth disapproves of Emily's father and the way she was raised, and has no trouble communicating that to the child. Fortunately, while Aunt Elizabeth is the boss of New Moon, Aunt Laura treats Emily more kindly and Cousin Jimmy Murray \\"ain't quite all there,\\" but is a gentle soul as well.At the heart of \\"Emily of New Moon\\" are the heated confrontations between Emily and Aunt Elizabeth over matters ranging from the little girl's bangs to her love of writing and the letters she writes to her father \\"On the Road to Heaven.\\" Apparently Emily has enough of the Murray blood to affect the look of her grandfather when her dander is up, so she does not lose all of these battles. The most notable is when Aunt Elizabeth discovers the letters Emily has been secretly writing to her father. When she confronts her neice, expecting Emily to show dismay, shame, or fear over what she has done, Elizabeth is stunned by the righteous indignation from Emily that turns the tables with a vengeance.There is also a touch of mysticism in each of these books, for Emily has the second sight, which sets up the moving climax of this first book when Emily is taken ill. In her fevered imagination the curtain is lifted and she sees what happened to the mother of her friend, Isla Burnley. The worried adults say whatever they think Emily wants to here, but she knows they are lying. When Aunt Elizabeth agrees to go and get Isle's mother out of the old well, Emily calms down. \\"I know you'll keep your word,\\" she says. \\"You are very hard--but you never lie, Aunt Elizabeth.\\" Emily's second sight comes into play in each of the three novels, but never to as great effect as it does in this first one.Because they deal with the art of writing, the three Emily books are seen as being the most autobiographical of Montgomery's works. Certainly if anyone reading the Anne books or any of Montgomery's works is interested in pursuing a career as a writer, they should read the Emily books to get a real feel for how hard it is to be a good writer. But the stories can be enjoyed on their own even if you have decided you are going to be a reader and not a writer. Once young readers have gone through the Anne and Emily books, there is still \\"The Story Girl,\\" \\"Magic for Marigold\\" and many other L. M. Montgomery novels (and short story collections) for them to enjoy. I did not read any of them until I was in my thirties, so I can assure you it is never too late to start."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"On the surface, Emily of New Moon is very much a copy of Anne of Green Gables. Emily and Anne are both orphans; they both go to live on a farm; they're both writers; the similarities go on and on. But if you look deeper, you'll notice that Emily is different than Anne. Anne is a more surface type of person: Emily is more mysterious, more withdrawn. The best way I can think of explaining it is that Emily is a shadowy type of person: certainly not in a evil way, but it a dreamy, more than meets the eye, way. She always seems to have dreams and ideas and hopes fluttering around her. If you'd like to read about a character who has a wonderfully developed personality, a characer whom the author obviously loved, read Emily of New Moon. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This book has stuck with me since I was nine years old...I am twenty one now, and a major in creative writing. I think this book especially but along with LMM's others, was my major inspiration. I always come back to it when I want to feel close to home. Emily is real, fiery and wonderful to read about."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It's about a young girl whose Father dies and she goes to live with her Aunts at New Moon.She has chalenges and problems with her Aunt Elizabeth but she soon falls in love with New Moon. She meets new people and only has a few friends. I highly recomened this book!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I agree with most things said by the other writers. The Emily books are something that I am thinking of buying now (I am only eighteen) so that in the future my own children can read them. Emily is brave, artistic and real - her friends and family are not perfect, but are loveablein their own way. What seems to set this apart from the other Mongomery books is the references to underlying sexuality and Emily's own psychic ability and spirituality. Every time I read the novels I discover something else about myself - personal beauty within the soul is something that shines through the character of Emily. Her love for herself and for others is inspirational and uplifting.Incidently, the first time I read these books (nearly ten years ago) I didn't realise that Jimmy was mentally retarded. I thought he was just artistic and creative. I was upset when I realised that Jimmy was handicapped, because it meant that he wouldn't be taken seriously and that, in real life, people would take longer to see his inner beauty."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Reading Emily of New Moon always makes me start picking up my pen and trying to write poems. I've learned I'll probably not succeed, but I still love the book and the urge to write that stays afterward. Emily is wonderful.Only, I personally liked Dean better. Better than Teddy, that is. He was an interesting character. Maybe it's just I'm sorry for him."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I read the Anne books first and I thought nothing could be better than them, but Emily is. What I like about her (better than Anne) is that she's an oddball. She isn't popular, and has only a few points of beauty, she always says whatever she feels like, and she has ESP. The book is great and so are the rest of the Emily novels and all of L.M. Montgomery's other books. The first time I read Emily of New Moon, I had borrowed it from the library along with Emily Climbs and Emily's Quest. I read all of them three times in three weeks! In fact, I read them over all the time now, since I decided to buy my own copies."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I enjoyed this book because Emily is a touching, if not always a believable character. Her unbelievableness, though, is part of what makes her a good character. Also, Aunt Elizabeth is a good relief from all the characters who think Emily is practacaly perfect, and that helps Emily find out about herself"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"For those of the Tribe of Joseph with a kindred spirit within themselves, you will easily find that these books are by far the best you've ever read. For those who aren't, you can't begin to understand, so do not try."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Honestly one of my most treasured books. If you have a heart this is one book you will save and love."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I too found this series after tearing through the Anne books and wishing there were more of them. I believe I would even have to say that I loved the Emily series even more than Anne."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily Starr is a daughter of a faith-confused father that her mother's family has shunned for his poverty. Her mother, Juliet Murray, died when she was five, and then when she is older, her father dies of consumption, leaving her an orphan.Her mother's family takes her in, and teaches her all their traditions and strict codes of honor and pride.Emily makes new friends, grows, and even has a few love intrests, despite her young age.The only problem I had with this book was her father way of thinking of God. He says everyone has their own God, and that Emily shouldn't worship their housekeeper's God.That is very untrute. Every one has their own PERSEPTION of God.Get it right L.M. :)"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"EMILY OF NEW MOON is really good. I like writing, so I can identify with Emily. Emily's adventures are cool, and I like the part where she can see what really happened to Illse's mother (Illese is her friend). I like the mischief Emily stirs up when she meets a Catholic priest. But sometimes it was just boring and predictable!!!! Some of the dialogue was stupid, and I thought \\"Jarback\\" Priest--Dean--was a flat character. It's a good book, but not as good as Anne."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I, too, read this book at about twelve years of age. I remember loving and identifying with Emily, and thinking Aunt Elizabeth was as cruel and tyranical as ever a woman could be. Now, eight years later, I am maturing, and can see Aunt Elizabth's viewpoint in more than a few of the squabbles she and Emily have. Also, I am more than a little conservative, and Emily, more so than what I remember, is a spoiled brat; at least, at the outset of the novel. Her poetry, I suspected, was quite good, although, obviously, very childish and verbosely overdrawn. I have to agree with what another reviewer wrote about \\"Emily Climbs\\". The family situations and home lives of all four main characters, Emily and her friends, are rather remarkable, and would make for a fascinating psychological case, if they were described in more detail. I have yet to read the other two books, but I think they will appeal more to me than this one has, because Emily is maturing, and becoming less impulsive, melodramatic, and emotionally intense, the way I was when a child. She is behaving more responsibly, and seems to have more of a regard for others' feelings as the books progress, another good sign, since self-absorption is never appreciated."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"As an avid Anne fan, I found myself disappointed with the first Emily book. I understand that many people believe Emily to be more realistic than Anne, but she struck me more as insufferable and spoiled. For some reason, I found the events of her life to be uninteresting and nearly didn't finish the book because it was such a drag to read. Perhaps this book is more suitable for younger readers around Emily's age, while Anne's is a more timeless saga that will enchant even the older set. All in all, I found Emily and her story to be extremely childish and boring, although L.M. Montgomery's fine writing skill still shined through, which is why I gave the book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I find this book to be a manifestation of LM's homosexual desires. I think that I am the only one to see this because I am gay myself.I am especially pleased to hear about the *friendship* between Emily and Laura, which they play down in order to not be found out by their other family members. To me, they seem to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;.On the brighter side, I enjoy reading LMs description of cousin Jimmy. I've been having dreams about Jimmy and I in the park.I recommend this book for all gays. I just don't think that straights can appreciate it."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"this is one of my favorite books and series. i heard of this book after whatching the canadian show that is based on it. a must read"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I named my daughter after the beloved little Emily Starr in this fantastic series of books! After reading all three by L.M Montgomery I found myself wanting to take a walk with young Emily as she grew. And when my daughter was born I hoped beyond hope that she would be much like her in spirit and heart! A must read for anyone who has a young daughter or for anyone who is still a young daughter at heart!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It's a shame that most people like either Anne or Emily; I've avoided the whole question by loving them both. The Emily books give a picture of a girl with lights and darks, reacting naturally (and therefore not always cheerfully) to the events of her life. She is far from perfect, but as L.M. Montgomery says about her, you may like her, you may hate her, but you'll never forget her.If what you love about Anne is the sparkling, bubbly world she creates around herself, then you probably won't like Emily. But if you like L.M. Montgomery and would like to see her go a different route, the Emily trilogy is a great read!!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I loved Emily of New Moon and its sequels just as well as I did the Anne books; contrary to what other people seem to think, I felt that both were quite believable characters. I didn't think Anne was superficial or less interesting than Emily. The fact is, when I read these books, I wished both girls were real so I could know them and be their friend. But Emily is quite interesting and very intelligent, overall a wonderful character, and the book is very well-written."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I love books by L.M Montgomery, especially the Emily series. There was something...lacking in the Anne books. I wish she had taken the Emily trilogy a bit further. Emily is more real then Anne, and a bit...darker."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"One day, while skimming the shelves of the Young Adult section of the Library, I ran across 3 books. I noticed that they were from the same Author of &quot;Anne of GreenGables&quot; and I had truly loved those books, so I decided to get these new, mysterious books that I had never heard of. &quot;Emily of NewMoon&quot; &quot;Emily Climbs&quot; and &quot;Emily's Quest&quot;. I got home, jumped on my bed, and began reading. Looking up, I noticed I had finished 1/2 the book, and that a couple of hours had passed. I bought all 3 of them here, and I am SO happy that I did. I really don't know what more I can say, I just LOVE these books more than ANY possesion that I have. And that isn't a joke! They inspired me, and I have read EVERY other book of LLM's, but still, my favorites are the &quot;Emily&quot; series. I really hope that you buy this book, it's SO worth it. I read them over and over and over. and when I open the book, I know exactly where I am, and then I can't put it down! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"i finished reading the emily trilogy just recently and i was impressed.. thios series isn't as popular as the anne of green gavles one but it's just as good! emily and anne have certain similarities but emily is even more assertive and ambitious. by the time i finished reading the books, i felt as if i really got to know emily although she's just a fictitious character."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful! After reading the Anne of Green Gable series, I firmly decided that I had to read more of Montgomery's books. When I read this book, I was delighted with my choice. This book is so realistic and fun, and her descriptions of the characters make you feel that you know them. I feel that I could relate with them all. Emily's adventures are so descriptive that you feel as if you are experiancing them as she is. It is a great book that I reccommend to everyone who loves the Anne series. You will be hugely satisfied with it, and Emily's difference on personality from Anne's is a delightful change. Altogether it is the best book of Montgomery's that I have read!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read this book about four years ago, and I fell in love with it! Now, I read it about once a year, just to re-live it all. I read the &quot;Anne&quot; series first, and I think that the &quot;Emily&quot; series is just as good, if not better. The descriptions of her relatives, cats, and friends are just so life-like. This book is really good, not just for kids, but for anyone! Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"A wonderful book, a great series. Emily is a less determinedly sunny character than Anne, and a lot more to my taste (I think the world is divided into Emily people, Anne people, and men, but that's just a theory. I can't get my husband to appreciate the books.)A wonderfully honest book about family, growing up, and finding a life path. I just hope the copies they're publishing now are sturdier, when I was a child I had to buy a new copy every year because they fell apart."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"After having read and enjoyed the Anne of Green Gables series as well as a few of L.M. Montgomery's other books, I was eager to start this book. It's hard for me to say who I like better - Anne, or Emily. But Emily is closer to my heart in the fact that we both love writing and cats.Emily's different - not as spunky as Anne, but she is a lovable character nonetheless. I found myself enjoying Emily's spirit and defiance, and loved the rest of the Emily series as well."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is just another of Montgomery's wonderful creations that brings comfort and peace from the world around you. It is a story that keeps you wanting more...which you get in the other two books! I found myself hoping for Emily's happiness in overcoming her grief, and I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I adore Anne, but Emily is a Kindred Spirit. I've read all of L.M. Montgomery's books, and this one is, without doubt, the very best. And yes - it IS better than Anne of Green Gables.Emily of New Moon has all the elements of a well-written novel. It has tragic scenes that aren't overly dramatic: the quiet death of her father makes me cry no matter how many times I've read it. It's inspiring: even as a young girl, she struggles with ambition. It's endearing: who could forget the happy, childish adventures of Emily and Ilse? Most of all, it has a sense of humor! (Though, I must point out, LMM's funniest scene ever is in Emily's Quest, where she reads the reviews of her first novel.)People love Anne because of her sweetness. Emily isn't sweet--she's real. As the narrator writes (I'm paraphrasing) \\"Many people liked her, many disliked her; no one was ever wholly indifferent to her.\\" My very favorite book."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is the remarkable story of Emily, a young girl who is sent to live with her Aunt Elizabeth after her father dies. The story is all about how Emily adapts to her new surroundings and her new friends. As the book progresses, gradually you see that Emily has grown as a person, and as a writer. You care about Emily and want to know what happens to her. Emily is such an enjoyable person that it is difficult to put the book down! Emily is a very real person and I really felt that I knew her."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I have read alot of Montgomerys novels and by far this is best one yet! The descriptions are wonderful, you can almost see the places there.The people are so different that it makes the book equal out quite nicely."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"My first L.M. Montgomery was one of the Anne series. But I like Emily a lot better - she seems like a real person, somehow, unlike Anne, which was nice in her own way, but never seemed like a real person. I think this is the best book in the series, because the author hadn't been committed to a certain set of characters yet, and can develop them freely."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily of New Moon is a book that starts a whole new adventure for me! I would say that Emily is my favorite character, for she is the one you get to know the best. She is in many ways like Anne of Green Gables. But she has a different personality. The setting in which this story takes place is realistic and you get a taste of what life was like around the turn of the century living in a town like the one Emily lives in. The way in which each character speaks lets you know what their personality is like. Emily has her hopes, ambitions and dreams for the future. She copes with her new life after losing both of her beloved parents, finds understanding from her new family and happiness from three new close friends. Above all, Emily discovers a wonderful hidden talent within her!"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I first read the Emily of New Moon series when I was about 12 and then read it again and again. I'm now 25 and desperate to read it again, thus my visit to amazon. It's a series of books that you can just lose yourself in. I've kept the inspiration, courage and cheekiness of Emily with me all my life."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I loved the story of a young proud orphan taken in by reletives who she is sure dont love her. but when she makes new friends and begins to have adventures emily decides maybe new moon is the place for her"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"The very lines on the pages seem to live. Beautiful characters, and never boring. Emily can be lived at any age. Never has a book held so much truth and mystery at the same time, that is what makes this series so beautiful.These books are the best books ever written, or read."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"This is a delightful book! In some ways, it is like Anne of Green Gables--Emily is a orphan who goes to live with strict guardian--but it has its own special charm. The characters are more developed, though I LOVED Marilla, Matthew, and the rest of Avonlea, Cousin Jimmy, Aunt Nancy, Aunt Elizabeth, Dr.Burnley, and Mrs.Kent(Teddy's mother) is even more interesting. The Murray clan is absolutely hilarious! And Emily's friends are pretty special too. They are all unique--hot-tempered Ilse, crude but lovable Perry, and Teddy(my favorite!) Each episode is a work of art--and the adventures are even more delightful looking through Emily's eyes in her letters to her Father. Emily gives a special tang to everything--she isn't as sweet as Anne or as lovable as Pat, but there is something about her--mysterious, passionate, ambitious--which makes her just as delightful, or even more so."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Anne of Green Gables may be L.M. Montgomery's best-known book, but it doesn't deserve to be. While Anne is somewhat superficial and Pollyanna-ish, Montgomery gave Emily all the light and darkness of a living being. Emily's character is developed through her own eyes as she writes in her journal, but a hillarious, pathetic, wise, and unforgettable supporting cast prevent the books from being to introspective.Montgomery does occasionally fall into her besetting sin of over-flowery descriptions, but they in no way detract from the haunting beauty of this series."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily of New Moon is starry, poignant, and captivating. Orphaned Emily Byrd Starr comes to New Moon lonely and friendless, to live with her Mother's relations, the Murrays.The Murrays are not willing to take her in, but are proud and consider it their duty to bring Emily up, as she is a member of their clan. Her Aunt Elizabeth brings her the New Moon, and is cold and harsh and stern. But her sweet Aunt Laura, and kindly Cousin Jimmy provide Emily with support.In Emily's imagination, loyal friends Ilse Burnley, Teddy Kent and Perry Miller, as well as her passionate love of writing, Emily finds hope and friendliness in her new World.Emily is often compared to Anne of Green Gables, but they hold their differances. Anne is all liveliness and hot temper and sweetness; Emily is vivid, both light and dark, with enough mystery in her to allure.This book is beautifully written and delicate, full of subtle wit and humour, and wonderful complexity as it describes Emily's adventures while living at New Moon. Emily is spirited and charming and ambitious, and the Emily series portray a unique child developing into womanhood."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It always bothers me that I have to find all of L.M. Montgomery's books in the children's section at bookstores. I always feel vaguely silly looking at books that are placed in the same category with the Goosebumps series. I must admit though, even though I am male, I find every single one of Montgomery's books to be full of humor, poignancy, and just plain joy de vivre.The Emily series is no exception. I actually enjoy this series better than the Anne series, with the possible exception of Rilla of Ingleside. Emily is my favorite of all of Montgomery's heroines, and I find her supporting characters to be absolutely irresistable, especially Isme. The whole series made me laugh, cry, the whole sentimental cycle.Often I am amazed at the subtlety of Montgomery's humor and the little insights into life that are peppered throughout her books. I have never considered them to be children's books. Merely because kids will enjoy a book does not make it suddenly a sophmoric work. The literary world has long ignored this Canadian Sunday school teacher, and I hope that one day Lucy Maude Montgomery will be recognized for her astounding achievements in her chosen field."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Sheltered by her loving father, 10-year-old Emily Byrd Starr has never minded her isolated life. What child notices poverty and a lack of playmates when her intelligence and imagination make each day special and exciting?Then one terrible day, Emily finds herself an orphan. A mass of never-before-met aunts and uncles descend upon Emily, criticizing and making plain the fact that whoever takes the child is only doing so out of their sense of duty.Still reeling from the loss of her father, Emily must also leave her beloved little home and pets for New Moon, her mother's childhood home, where unmarried aunts Elizabeth and Laura currently reside. It is with stern matriarch Elizabeth, gentle, loving Laura and \\"simple-minded\\" Cousin Jimmy that Emily must now learn to form a family.Despite the hardships, Emily's new life is quickly filled with many joys, as she makes friends at the village school and develops her interest for writing. Emily also experiences -- at the most unexpected moments -- \\"the flash,\\" her word for the brief startling glimpses of other-worldliness, which has the power to change both her life and the lives of others around her.Ask most people what they associate with L.M. Montgomery, and they'll likely say Anne of Green Gables. Yet despite the fame of Montgomery's \\"other orphan,\\" the Emily books are quite possibly even more memorable and beautifully written. Like Anne, Emily is thrust into an unfamiliar world, where she must make the best of circumstances; but unlike Anne, Emily is possessed of a strangely adult maturity even at the tender age of ten, a glimpse of darkness which will accompany her through the years. This streak makes readers both more concerned for her well-being and perhaps more able to relate, as she is not nearly as happy-go-lucky and childlike as Anne in her early years.If you enjoy this book, be sure to read \\"Emily Climbs\\" and \\"Emily's Quest,\\" which follow the girl through her years at high school, through romantic relationships and her writing career as a young woman."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Although Emily has a lot of things in common with Anne--both eleven-year-old orphans who live on Prince Edward Island in the nineteenth century--she is a different kind of girl, and hers is a different kind of story. It's great from beginning to end, and the mystery of Ilse's mother had me on the edge of my seat--great suspense. The only thing I didn't like about the story was that it said mean, untrue things about atheists. But I suppose it was a product of its time."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"At the beginning of &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, Emily Byrd Starr is orphaned when her father dies from a long-drawn-out heart problem that resulted from his wife's death five years ago. Consequently, Emily is sent to live with her mother's family: the Murrays (Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Laura, and Cousin Jimmy) from Blair Water on New Moon Farm (in Prince Edward Island, Canada). The head of the family, Aunt Elizabeth, remains Emily's biggest obstacle to overcome. She refuses Emily to wear bangs, associate with certain friends, or trespass in Lofty John's orchard. But the worst rule is that Emily is not allowed to read or write fiction, including poetry. Emily, of course, gets away with the other three things (not without consequences, of course), but when Aunt Elizabeth reads her journal, especially the bit about herself, Emily is certain her aunt will send her away for good.Emily's other two relatives are much more agreeable though, particularly Cousin Jimmy who understands her need to create stories. He, too, loves poetry and strongly encourages her to continue writing, which, Emily believes, is her lot in life.In addition, she makes friends with three neighbors (Teddy, Perry, and Ilse), but her friendship with Ilse is the strongest. Despite their hot-and-cold relationship, Emily is fiercely loyal to her best friend. So, when Emily hears a rumor from two of her gossipy aunts about the scandalous disappearance of Ilse's mother, Emily vows to uncover the truth, even while she's deliriously ill with measles.This is a great book for 11+ year-old girls, as are all of L. M. Montgomery's novels. If you liked Emily of New Moon, I highly recommend reading the other two books in the Emily series: &quot;Emily Climbs&quot; and &quot;Emily's Quest&quot;."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Of all the Montgomery novels I have read, I find the &quot;Emily&quot;-Series the best.

M. Montgomery. I became a devoted fan of hers since I have read the 'Anne' books. I really love them a great deal and Emily of New Moon is just as tempting as them. I didn't think I could love it as much as I do with the 'Anne' books. I spot the difference and similarity between Emily and Anne. Anne is more mature while Emily more childlike. They both adore writing but Emily loves it better. Anne is more stubborn and fanciful. Anne led a happier existence in Green Gables. Emily was contented to live in New Moon, though, but in a way different from Anne. She had a stern Aunt Elizabeth, who loved her but just locked the love for her niece up inside. Her adventures were very very funny and amusing too. L. M. Montgomery made the other characters in the story very lovable. And each of them had their own characteristics. The story gets more and more gripping towards the end. I could't help reading it till I finished the whole story. It is a story which makes you feel delighted and young and energetic. And I am going to read the rest of this series---Emily climbs and Emily's quest and other books written by L. M.

Anne of Green Gables is a tour de force of a book, but the series as a whole isn't that great. The Emily series is a sheer masterpiece that's not to be missed, especially for older readers.

In fact, I spent my entire 10 year old savings on LM Montgomery books after reading Emily of New Moon.The Emily books are darker, more grown up, than the Anne books, and a year never goes by that I don't reread Emily. The heartbreaks (losing her dad, having to choose which cat to leave behind), the fears, and the triumphs that Emily goes through felt true when I was a young girl, and still feel true nearly two decades later.It breaks my heart that LM Montgomery books periodically go out of print. I encourage anyone who wants to own her books to get them when they see them, or they may have to wait a long time for them to come back into print."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"As a child, Emily of New Moon was, quite literally, my favorite book. Somehow, years later, it manages to still be up there with The Picture of Dorian Gray, Lolita, and Vanity Fair on my \\"favorites\\" shelf.It is, truth be told, a classic, and a sorely underrated one to boot. While the Anne series seems to be omnipresent, I know very few people who have heard of Emily, let alone read the books.As a character, Emily is brilliantly drawn and realistic; she is never portrayed with condescension. Quite the opposite, even when she is entirely in the wrong, the reader manages to sympathize and understand her. The plot itself, though interesting, is mostly enjoyable because of Emily's perspective. Other characters, such as Dean Priest (my personal favorite), Teddy, and Ilse manage to avoid being stereotypes or Emily's \\"backup band\\" and become full-fleshed characters in their own right.Whether you are an adult with a child or wishing you were a child, or even an adult just looking for a relatively light read that has actual quality (various romance novel queens, I'm glaring at YOU), pick up a copy of Emily, make some tea, curl up, and enjoy this strange little girl."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is about a girl named Emily Byrd Starr.

For those lookign for the effervesence of Anne would be disappointed. But there is something deeper to Emily than Anne. Something which reaches out to the readers. She is not one who would immediately capture hearts like Anne, but she is one who you would remember longer. I loved Anne - and it was with a lot of &quot;she-cant-be-that-good&quot; feeling taht I started on Emily - and I couldnt stop the read. I jumped to Emily Climbs the next morning and hunted high and low for the next day (the search ending in success) for Emiy's quest. This is a magnificent series - much better than the Anne series. My sole disappointment is that there are only three in the series where Anne had a huge full series to herself. I think Emily touches you more because she is a more real person than Anne. She suffers and cries as we all do - her pride is somethign which is understandable - her hidden desires and fantasies are all so magnificently protrayed by LMMontgomery. There can be no better read for anyone than these books."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Every teen and pre-teen girl should read this book. It's not like other teen books, and that's one of the reasons it's so good.

By the author of Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"It is difficult for me to write an objective review about this beloved classic. Emily is like a childhood friend to me. Created by the author of Anne of Green Gables, she is a more complex character than Anne - introspective, determined, and deeply sensitive to life's joys and shadows. Her love for writing, or her need to write, defines her; indeed, much of the story is told through her writing. And yet this first book of the Emily trilogy is mostly lighthearted, though not without its passages of intense experience. Emily is orphaned in the beginning of the book, and moves to the farm of New Moon to live with two estranged aunts and one uncle, their brother. She thrives and flourishes in the beautifully prosaic, quaint world of New Moon and Blair Water on Prince Edward Island. Though she is a private and secretive person, she gives lavishly of herself in her closest friendships.Montgomery's writing is at times indulgently over-descriptive, but not without vividity, wryness, feeling, and rich character development. Perhaps the most eloquent aspect of Emily of New Moon is its flavorful honesty about life both light and dark. Emily is a complex character, full of both faults and virtues, neither of which are expressed simplistically. The reader's sympathies are always with her. Montgomery's indirect insights into the writing life are also very valuable. Emily has writing in her blood, sees it as something intrinsically personal and sacred but wants to share it, does it with abandon yet later throws it away, and yearns to climb the ladder of fame. In this sense, I feel more kinship with her than with her more popular sister Anne Shirley."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"From the opening pages the reader is submerged in Emily's world.In my mind Emily of New Moon is the begining of one of the best book trilogies ever written. A story about the courage it takes to be true to ones self no matter the opposition, the power of real determination and true friendship. One cannot help but be moved by the powerful truths, and innocent loveliness contained in this book. EONM is quite simply a multi faceted masterwork that could hardly be improved upon in any way. A deeply moving and relavent novel who's beauty only grows with time. Mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts, read this book then gift it to someone you love."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Like many others, I came to this book as a child after exhausting the Anne series and still craving more of the world L.M. Montgomery created. Anne was my favorite as a child, which you can tell by comparing my beat-up copy of Anne of Green Gables and the nearly-pristine copy of Emily of New Moon. I still have a special place in my grownup heart for Anne, but in recently rereading Emily of New Moon, I discovered so many similarities between me and that poetic little girl who gets \\"the flash.\\"I love all Montgomery's books because it's fascinating to read about a time when children were expected to behave so differently from today in a place that seems lovely and peaceful compared to today's busy world of computers, video games and television. It's nice to read about a child who so strongly relied on her imagination; I hope to teach my future children to do the same."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Ten-year-old Emily Starr always felt that she had the most wonderful life. She never felt lonely, as she was blessed enough to live with her beloved Father, her adored cats, Saucy Sal, and Mike, and a collection of fine books for her to read at anytime. It didn't even bother her to have Ellen, her somewhat wicked housekeeper around. But in one quick instant Emily's life is suddenly turned upside down. After having a fine life she receives the news that her Father is dying, and when he does finally pass, 10-year-old Emily is left an orphan, and is suddenly forced to move to New Moon Farm with her mean Aunt Elizabeth, who makes her choose only one of her beloved cats to accompany her during the move. Emily's only solace from her depression of her Father's death, and dealing with her stern Aunt are the new friends she makes: Ilse, a tomboy with an extreme temper; Teddy, a fantastic artist; and Perry, also a newcomer to school, who has sailed all over the world with his Father. Soon, thanks to her new adventures and friends, Emily realizes that New Moon isn't that bad at all, and maybe, just maybe, she'll be able to think of herself as Emily of New Moon.This is my second L.M. Montgomery novel, and I was very pleased by the outcome of it. Emily is a strong-willed, hard-headed character, with a sense of adventure, whom stands up for everything, and everyone, that she believes in. Her Aunt is an exciting character, even though she is a bit cruel, and her friends are three people whom the reader longs to know and be friends with in reality. The descriptions are so vivid, realistic, and beautiful that you actually feel as if you are with Emily, running along the trails and through the gardens of New Moon. A must-have book for all fans of novels with a bit of history tucked into them.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"I know a lot of people are saying that the \\"Emily\\" books are better than the \\"Anne\\" books, but I will always remain a true-blue Anne fan. That said, I have to admit that there is something special about Emily and the Emily series as a whole that is lacking in the Anne books. I think it reflects more on the fact that LMM was already an established and mature writer when she wrote the Emily books (whereas \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" was her first full-length novel), than on the characters of the two series. Also, the differences reflect on the different time-periods they were written in: the first two Anne books were written well before the outbreak of the First World War, and reflect some of the priggishness and smugness of the Victorian world-view still prevalent then; the Emily books are entirely a product of the more free-thinking 1920s (though they are set pre-WWI). Anne is a child in many ways - even after marriage; Emily is a woman even at the age of eleven. Anne's vivacious personality is genuinely appealing, but Emily's intensity has its place too. Emily is a lot more realistic than Anne ever is - both as a character and a person. And I identify far more with Emily than with Anne - e.g. I experience something similar to Emily's flash, and my inner world has many similarities to hers.I thought the best part about \\"Emily of New Moon\\" was the last chapter, where Emily's teacher evaluates her work. When I read the title of the chapter - \\"Emily's great moment\\" - I thought that it would be a stereotypical ending, where the heroine takes the world by storm and retires heaped with laurels - in other words, completely unbelievable! But the low-key ending was superb. I loved the fact that Emily was vindicated in her own eyes and the only others that mattered, i.e. Mr. Carpenter's. In short, being a chart-topper is not *the* (or even *a*) criterion for being a good writer.The only thing I disliked about this book is the supernatural element, not being a believer in the paranormal myself. Oh, and I cannot stand Teddy Kent - what does Emily see in him?!To conclude - a good book, though the sequel \\"Emily Climbs\\" is better (I have yet to read \\"Emily's Quest\\"). Read it if you like LMM, and whether you like Anne or not."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"When I was a child, I found the story of Emily after reading most of the Anne of Green Gables series. I remember LOVING Emily for the brave heroine she seemed to be. I recently bought the books again and just finished the first book. I didn't realize how much Emily has declined in my admiration over the years.After her father dies of consumption, Emily's mother's siblings gather to decide who she will live with. When her sour Aunt Elizabeth wins responsibility, Emily is taken to the family farm, New Moon, where tradition and pride are the hallmarks (or hindrances). Aunt Elizabeth's sternness is tempered by Aunt Laura's kindness; Cousin Jimmy, the lone male on the place, provides a sympathetic ear to Emily's spirit, much like Matthew did in the Anne books. When Emily starts school, she makes friends with Teddy, Ilse, and Perry, three neighborhood children. As a group, they negotiate the next two years with most of the action centering around Emily getting into trouble; not only does she have to be rescued when she falls over a cliff, she cuts a bang after being forbidden to do that, and then cuts off the rest of her hair to try to hide what she had done. Emily charms most of the people she meets and wins their heart, but can she win over the heart of Aunt Elizabeth?This was an OK book, but it wasn't as good as I remember. Aunt Elizabeth is far too un-relenting; we only get momentary glimpses of her real concern for her niece til the end, when she gets mad at Emily for writing the truth about her. What does the woman expect after how she has treated her and they spend the whole book arguing? I found Emily's psychic episode a little unbelievable, coming out of the blue; their explanation is a little too pat, that the great-granmdother had the second sight. And, it may just be my adult nature, but what human being gets into this many \\"scrapes\\"? I was klutzy, but the child falls over a cliff picking flowers!And that brings me to a slightly troubling topic. It's fairly obvious Dean Priest is romantically interested in Emily. This would be fine, except he's old enough to be her father, he knew her father in college, and she's 12! He tells her he will be the one to teach her the romantic talk, he visits her when she is sick there are several other things he does that set off my creepy meter. I couldn't understand how her family didn't question his intentions. Even setting aside the fact that young girls married older men in those days and it was more acceptable, there is a 20-something year age difference that is unappealing.I am going to read the other two books in the series, but I'm not sure if I want to share these books with my child. Til I decide, I'll stick with Anne of Green Gables."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Emily isn't as easy to love as the amiable Anne, it's true. Emily is a much more trouble young girl with deep passions and strange ways that few in her world can understand. Her world is not all sunshine and happiness, and she had neither the desire nor the abilities to make it so. Emily goes to live with her aunts at New Moon after the death of her father. There is not much love between Aunt Elizabeth and her new charge, and frankly thinks Emily a weird little alien creature. Emily takes solace in writing unintentionally hilarious epistles to her father, pouring out her childish heart. Many adventures and interesting characters are met along the way, making the world of Emily an interesting one, if at times a little dark.The first in the series, \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is a much darker story than Anne. Emily still has a lot of her childish ways throughout the book, but we get the chance to see her grow by the time the book ends. The second and third books are better than the first, but \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is a welcome addition to realistic children's literature, but it will enchant older readers as well."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Since I was a little girl, I have been a devoted fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery and all she has written.

This is so because the book is chocked full of everything wonderful from the world as viewed by a child of one hundred years ago--if your reading style does not allow for whimsy and delight, I do not suggest it. However, I, as have many other little girls of past and present, slowly grew up right along with Emily, and part of what I am is thanks to Montgomery and her wonderful and inspiring characters.

When her father awakes later, he berates Ellen for having revealed this truth to Emily in such a hurtful way.Then he shares memories with Emily of her mother and of the Murray clan.When he dies, Ellen still doesn't offer Emily comfort. She informs Emily that her relatives are coming to the house to decide who will raise her. Emily expresses the wish that her relatives will love her. Ellen denies her even this hope, calling Emily a strange child because she lives in her imagination as well as advising Emily that people don't love strange children.Upon their arrival, the relatives pick Emily apart in her presence, meaning they argue about who she looks and acts like down to whose forehead she has. Emily declares to their faces that they make her feel like \\"scraps and patches\\". Her relatives order her to leave, but Emily hides under the table to hear her fate. When the relatives begin to criticize her father, Emily gives herself away by rushing out and yelling at them in her father's defense. Tired of her outbursts, the relatives draw straws to determine who should take her. The rest of the book is about her life with the \\"winners\\".Although I love Anne of Green Gables, Emily of New Moon is my favorite creation of Lucy Maud Montgomery. Both girls are imaginative, outspoken, and passionate. Yet unlike Anne, Emily is more introverted with darker moods and less social grace. Perhaps for these reasons, Emily is often rejected for her differences, rather than embraced and loved like Anne. Therefore, I feel more akin to Emily."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is the initial entry of famed author Lucy Maud Montgomery's trilogy about a young girl growing up on Prince Edward Island, Canada. The dark-haired, gray-eyed Emily Byrd Starr is stubborn and imaginative, and has a gift for writing. The death of her beloved father leaves her dependent on the charity of her proud Murray relatives at the family farm of New Moon. Her maiden Aunt Elizabeth takes up the duty of raising Emily by the strictest of rules; she and Emily will do repeated battle over Emily's need to express herself.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an absolutely engaging story. Author Lucy Maud Montgomery adroitly introduces Emily to new relatives, playmates, life lessons, and adult mentors who provide varying degrees of encouragement (or discouragement) for her writing talents. Along the way, Montgomery prepares the ground for the follow-on books. She cleverly sets up future romantic dynamics among Emily and her playmates, and a problematic mentorship relationship with an older man whose motivatation might be suspect. The most significant plot resolution of \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an incident which appears to demonstrate that Emily is \\"fey\\", that she has the ability to see \\"beyond the curtain\\" of everyday reality.Lucy Maud Montgomery's \\"Emily\\" trilogy is thought to reflect the famed author's emotionally starved childhood and difficult apprenticeship as a writer in a way the happier \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series never did. \\"Emily of New Moon\\" has a darker tone than the \\"Anne\\" series, but is every bit as entertaining, and is highly recommended to Montgomery's fans."},{"Title":"Emily of New Moon","review":"Famed Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery began her \\"Emily\\" trilogy shortly after completing what she thought would be her last \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" novel. \\"Emily of New Moon\\" is thought to more closely capture the difficult, emotionally starved childhood of the young Montgomery than the happier \\"Anne\\" stories.As \\"Emily of New Moon\\" opens, the young Emily Byrd Starr is orphaned by the death of her father. Her Murray relatives draw lots to determine who shall have the duty of raising her. Emily ends up with her austere maiden Aunt Elizabeth at New Moon Farm. Aunt Elizabeth is strict in her ways, and feels duty-bound to repress Emily's imagination and her gifts as a writer. Emily will be driven to conceal her talents.On the positive side, New Moon brings Emily more sympathetic relatives in Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy; new playmates Teddy Kent, Perry Miller, and Ilsa Burnley; and the opportunity to go to school.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is an engaging story, taking Emily up through the age of twelve, but the novel is clearly devoted to laying the groundwork for its two sequels. Emily will absorb the usual childhood lessons in life. Along the way, she will receive just enough positive feedback to enable her to persist in her writing, while coping with the rather frightening gift of \\"fey\\" from her Scottish ancestors that enables her to solve a poignant family mystery.\\"Emily of New Moon\\" is very highly recommended to fans of L.M.

The book follows Patricia Gardiner from age seven to age eighteen, but does not seem rushed. There is no complicated plot involving secret identities and there is very little melodrama, in my opinion. Pat of Silver Bush is \\"character-driven\\" and realistic. It celebrates the beauty of home and of everyday life. Over and over, the descriptions made me shiver and sigh. The episode in which Pat gets lost after running away from her aunt's house and meets Jingle on the road is wonderful. I sympathized with Pat's fear and with her relief and, finally, with the overwhelming joy she feels when she arrives home and sees the windows all lit up. When Pat stayed out after dark with her friends (or alone) I could almost feel the way the evening air would brush against my cheeks and shoulders if I were out on a summer night on Prince Edward Island. Pat's friendship with Bets is sweet and realistic. It made me think, \\"Every kid should have at least one really close friend like that.\\" Pat's infatuations with different boys when she is a teenager are also realistic...they reminded me of some of my own experiences, even though I was a teenager in the 1990's! If you are a sensitive person who delights in little pleasures (and if you like a book that will make you cry), read Pat of Silver Bush. The only thing about the book that got annoying at times was Judy's dialect. I think readers can imagine an Irish brogue without constantly seeing it spelled out phonetically. I won't dock my rating any stars for it, though. It can be distracting, but it doesn't really take away from the novel."},{"Title":"Pat of Silver Bush","review":"Miss Lucy Maud Montgomery is one of my favorite authors. I love all her works.

As time pass by, I am the only child in my family who still remain single and live in 'our home', which is a cozy house with lots of love and memory. Perhaps that is the reason why I was so touched by Pat's story. The joy and loneliness of Pat are so vivid and real to me.I read with laughers and tears with Pat's story and I believe your will, too.

L.M.Montgomery's classic style of warmth and innocence is in full force here. You can also always count on her giving marvelous descriptions. I love that she does that!

The book follows Pat's expansive imagination in her childhood, and then her struggles to accept change as her family changes as she grows older. The book ends when Pat is eighteen, but her story is picked up in Mistress Pat (which I have not yet read).

The descriptions are great, and there are many funny and touching episodes. I also enjoy Judy's Irish dialect, it makes her a fun character. This is definitely a must-read if you like Anne and Emily and the others. However, the sequel, Mistress Pat, was not very good at all.

Montgomery's 1933 novel \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" features an interesting heroine, Patricia Gardiner, a good-hearted, hardworking, and sometimes fanciful girl whom we first meet at age seven. She lives with her parents, siblings, an Irish domestic, and many cats and kittens at Silver Bush, a farm on Prince Edward Island, Canada, between the World Wars.The novel follows Pat to age eighteen, as she mets the usual challenges of childhood: a new sibling, school, her first party, her first beau, and her first wedding. Some other challenges are a bit more trying: family illnesses, the departure of older siblings, and the death of a close friend. Pat finds comfort with Judy Plum, long time family servant and great teller of tales; Bets Wilcox, her neighbor and close confident; and Hilary Gordon, a young boy who rescues Pat one dark night and who becomes part of her life. Most of all, Pat is sustained by her love of her home of Silver Bush. Pat can imagine nothing better in life than to become the mistress of Silver Bush.In a rather bittersweet ending that sets up a sequel, Pat becomes the mistress of a depleted household, but at the cost of a relationship with a young man whose love she is blind to. L.M. Montgomery's superb narrative gifts carry a charming coming of age story. \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" is very highly recommended to fans of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and other L.M. Montgomery novels."},{"Title":"Pat of Silver Bush","review":"L.M. Montgomery's \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" is a charming coming of age novel, set in Prince Edward Island, Canada, between the World Wars. Its heroine, Patricia Gardiner, is good-hearted, hardworking, and fiesty when her ginger is up. Her outstanding characteristic is her love of Silver Bush, the traditional family farmhouse and a source of stability and pride. Young Pat spends much of the story honing her domestic skills, and can imagine nothing more fulfilling than being mistress of Silver Bush.The novel follows Pat from age seven to eighteen. She will experience such childhood challenges as a new baby in the family, school, her first party, her first beau, and her first wedding. Other challenges are more traumatic: a couple of serious family illnesses, the slow departure of siblings to their futures, and the death of a treasured friend. She will be assisted along the way by Judy Plum, the family's long time Irish domestic and story-teller; by bosom friend Bets Wilcox; and by kindred spirit Hilary Gordon. The ending is a bit bittersweet (and a setup for a sequel) as Pat finds herself, somewhat by default, at last the mistress of Silver Bush, but at the cost of a promising relationship with a young man.Sadly, \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" appears to be out of print, but is very highly recommended, even in used condition, to fans of Lucy Maud Montgomery's novels and her remarkable storytelling skills."},{"Title":"Pat of Silver Bush","review":"Although by the end of Pat of Silver Bush, I was as impressed in many ways as I have been by all of Lucy Maud Montgomery's work that I have read so far, I have to also say that some aspects of the experience were not as engaging to this reader as I would have liked.As with her other creations, Anne \`of Green Gables', Emily \`of New Moon' and Jane \`of Lantern Hill', Pat \`of Silver Bush' is a loving, engaging and interesting child who goes through her early life - slowly at first but then suddenly much more quickly - from the age of 7 through 18 or 19. Her life can best be seen through her relationship with where she lives - in this case, Silver Bush - a typical strength of LM Montgomery's work. As a writer, Miss Montgomery frequently shows us the physical and emotional importance of 'place' as an anchor for her characters. Silver Bush is no less strong for Pat than New Moon was for Emily Starr and Green Gables was for Anne Shirley's early childhood. Place validates and confirms existence, providing stability and support for the heroine as she engages with other elements in her life most notably physical and emotional change.So this relationship between Pat and Silver Bush was a reliably great and positive element about this book, but other relationships were not so good and ill-defined. As I read more, it became apparent that Ms Montgomery was clearly struggling greatly to define Pat's other relationships with the chief members of her family - most notably with her older brother, Joe, her older sister, Winnie, and even more spectacularly with her parents who seem like dim and ghost-like figures on the fringes of Pat's existence. She is closest to Judy, the home servant, but who functions more like Pat's day-to-day mother. Judy is interesting and annoying by turns and I got fed up with every speech prefaced and then littered throughout by 'Oh Oh' and other supposed Irish dialect.Yet, it is Pat's parents who troubled me most about this book because as those of us who have read Montgomery's other works can testify to, her heroines for the most part are orphans who are in need of a home and empathetic parental guidance. In the Anne and Emily series, home takes the place of physical and emotional support but over time, care is additionally provided by Marilla to Anne and by an assortment of dysfunctional aunts to Emily. Yet for Pat, who by contrast, has a loving family and a permanent home, the relationship with her parents doesn't work which is odd. Just like Jane Austen's seeming failure to convincingly define life outside of small communities and lavish homes, and Charlotte Bronte's equal inability to convincingly describe industrial unrest throughout her novel Shirley, Lucy Maud Montgomery is seemingly out of her element with defining a convincing and meaningful relationship between her heroine, Pat, and her parents. They seem to be there, but not there, and yet all of her other heroines have longed for parents so the failure to engage Pat with her mother and father on something other than them just being there, and with little dialog between them, is so much the more striking given the longing that Anne, Emily and Jane have for parental stability.Indeed, I would go further and say that Pat's parents only really cross the book when something indifferent or hostile to Pat's needs and emotions needs to be expressed. I am thinking of her Dad's trip 'out west' to explore a farm possibility and the indifference to Winnie's supposed 'adoption' by relatives which fortunately for Pat fails to work out. They are part of the big picture of Pat's life at Silver Bush but not part of the day-to-day minutiae of existence - all of which is shared with Judy or with her friends Jingle and Bets. Her brother Sid, is better defined, but only in one of the final scenes with Winnie, is Pat's life really expressed in its intersection with her older sister. At least, it is the only time we really get to hear Winnie speak in the book.Pat of Silver Bush is unique in the oeuvre for Ms Montgomery because Pat has siblings and parents but for all of its descriptive and other strengths - we care a lot about what happens to Pat and her friends being amongst those - the way the writer connects or does not connect Pat to the rest of her family but leaves her predominantly in the care of Judy, is indeed a failure. Just telling us how important her parents and siblings are does not convey to this reader at least how important they are. Grieving over Joe leaving for shores unknown, her sister's wedding, her father's trip and her mother's illness does not convey the importance that they all have for Pat because we hardly ever hear her and them in conversation together. The only touching connection delineated with her father comes across with the story of who gets to name the new baby. Yet, 'Cuddles' remains 'Cuddles' throughout the rest of the book so the importance of how Pat manipulates events to allow her father to get to choose the name of the baby is diluted."},{"Title":"Pat of Silver Bush","review":"I had read many books by L.

Armenians were some of the richest Ottoman citizens that held high positions in the government. They believed the lies of colonial European powers, such as Russia, Britain, France, with the promise of an independent state, and attacked the Ottoman Army from the rear. Armed with the weapons given to them by the Allies, they massacered hundreds of thousands of unarmed innocent Turkish civilians. While the Turkish men were at war fighting at many theathers of war, the Armenian men stayed home, because they were exempt from military service. \\"They raped any Turkish women they found. They extracted the babies from expecting Turkish mothers with their bayonets. They stuffed the innocent Turkish elderly men, women, and children,into their mosques and burnt them alive. Even Russian generals at the scene, who witnessed these heinous acts, called them the most barbarous race they had ever seen\\". The Ottoman government re-located them out of the war zone, in self defence. Any other country would have punished them much more severely for these treasonous and barberous acts. Calling this relocation a genocide is disingenous, at the very least. The rewiver is saddened by loss of life suffered by the Armenians during the re-location process. Most of the deaths were caused by attacking Kurdish and Circussian bandits for revenge and booty. The number of Armenian deaths have been greatly exaggerated. The Ottoman Government was unable to protect them any better, because the country was in turmoil, at the time, due to the great war."},{"Title":"The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus (Monographs in German History)","review":"This study took an interesting approach, despite its title it has little about the actual implementation and excecution of the Armenian genocide instead covering topics such as: the Abdul Hamit Massacres, the Adana massacres, the bank Ottoman raid, Islam's bent for domination which implies inferiority for non-muslims dhimmis such as Armenians, German complicity, the failure of European humanitarian intervention due to their vested and colonial interests, the Young Turks, how the precarious situation of Armenians constantly massacred and vulnerable with little weaponry or outside diplomatic assistance made them contrary to Balkan Christians take the route of asking for reforms and protection within the Ottoman Empire instead of seeking their independence as they were in an existential crisis where they decided upon the failed project of seeking protection from a Turkish system that thrived on repression and oppression, the Kemalist invasion of Russian Armenia, a comparison of the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide, the Turkish post-war tribunals that failed to punish the key players of the Armenian genocide(but these trials did provide proof of the intent to destroy the Armenians), the role of impunity during and after the genocide and earlier massacres in the failure to punish muslims for their crimes and how the implacable Kemalists along with European vested interests made sure there was little in the way of punishment, among other topics. Chapter 14 entitled: &quot;The Implementation of the Genocide&quot; only spans from page 219-235 in the edition I read(second revised edition 1997). Such an approach to this study makes ensures that it is well covered why the Armenian genocide occurred, which is more important than drudging page after page about the actual genocide and its implementation, which would have gotten tedious as this book is over 400 pages.The scholarship of Dadrian shines throughout the work, he cites countless works in Turkish, Armenian, German, French and English and the work is very well referenced with a plethora of footnotes. This man has been studying the Armenian genocide for decades and it shows, I doubt much is written in the languages he can read about the subject that he has not already read, and most of it seems cited in this work. How Turkish historians and other historians can deny the Armenian genocide shows to anyone who has read this work their complete lack of honor and decency, to comment on history with no other desire than to extricate Turkish society and state from their mis-actions. Dadrian uses Austrian and German diplomatic archives at a time when they were Ottoman Turkey's wartime allies, he references the memoirs of architects and implementators of the genocide where they incriminate themselves, he cites the Turkish trials after the war to punish the Young Turks published in the official Turkish government gazette at the time(Takvimi Vekayi), Ataturk's speeches, eyewitnesses, Allied diplomatic archives, Turkish historians such as Refik and Akcam, and Turkish sociologist Ismail Besikci, who attest to the reality of the Armenian genocide.

It gives an accurate big picture description of much of the international politics going on at the time, which many other books on the subject do not. I found it quite objective with a scholarly tone. I think it was actually a little weak on descriptions of the horrors of the Genocide, yet this was not the author's focus. If an uninformed reader were to read one book on the Armenian Genocide, then this may not be the best one, I think &quot;Survivors: An Oral History of the Armenian Genocide&quot; or &quot;Black Dog of Fate&quot; are easier and more personal reads. However, Dadrian's book is a must for historians and experts on the subject, as it is probably the best true historical account on the subject to date."},{"Title":"The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus (Monographs in German History)","review":"This was a well written and thoroughly researched book documenting the treatment of the Armenians living under Turkish rule.

Instead I recieved a book that is full of wonderful academic work but confusing to read, and not focused on the genocide itself. I wanted a book closer to Martin GIlberts history of the holocaust which blends historical accuracy with documents and interesting accounts of the tradgedy. Instead this book goes overboard documenting German complicity while shying away from the actual deportations,t he massacres, maybe this is due to a lack of actual historical record. Fine...I will settle for that. But until Im satisfied im going to read \\"caravans to oblivion\\" and other books on the subject because I want a book dealing with the genocide, not just the documents of government soruces and diaries by government figures.

It has helped me overcome many of my biases. However, Dadrian portrays many issues as black-and-white. For example, he attributes the entire Ottoman reform movement to the intervention of European powers on behalf of Christian minorities. Furthermore, he pays no attention to the fact that the Turks also suffered greatly under &quot;Turkish misrule&quot;. The work also contains a misinformed and insulting chapter on Islamic Law. These biased statements will needlessly harm Dadrian's well-deserved reputation in the eyes of knowledgeable readers."},{"Title":"WILL THE REAL WOMEN ...

The reader still needs to have a fair amount of sophistication. This book is not &quot;dumbed-down&quot; at all."},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"The book is about a very curious man, Mr. Tompkins, who decides one day that instead of going to the movies he will instead attend a physics lecture. This one lecture sets him into a series of interesting events that will affect him for the rest of his life. Mr. Tompkins is apparently a very tired man, for he falls asleep almost every lecture and dreams of this \`Hypothetical World'. Mr. Tompkins becomes obsessed with the physicist and his lectures and begins to attend his lectures on a regular basis, falls asleep, and then enters the physics world along with the professor who teaching the lectures. The professor takes Mr. Tompkins to many exciting places; first he travels solo in his own town, but eventually he is taken to space based on the \`curved space' lecture and is able to see how the physics and astronomy worlds are quite intricately associated together and are still \`expanding'. He also gets to travel to the \`quantum jungle,' buy an elephant and hunt tigers; travel to the woodcarver, who looks an awful lot like Gepetto from Pinocchio, who instead of making puppets makes and paints atoms; meet geishas who feeds him a \`Japanese meal'; and best of all, he gets to go on a vacation with the professor and his daughter to not only learn about physics, but also meet his future companion. Yes, this story is not only a physics book, but it is also involves chemistry; both kinds of chemistry, the scientifically aspect as well as the romantic aspect. We are able to learn towards the end of the book that Mr. Tompkins does take the professor's daughter to wed and they live happily with the hypothetical world and real world often colliding.The book is organized in a consistent, clever manner. Mr. Tompkins will attend a lecture, fall asleep, and dream about the lecture. These dreams help to magnify exactly what the lecture was talking about since there are many equations and the language is for those higher educated. The certain scenarios he is involved in put the material in an easy format to understand and also make the story quite interesting. Reading just a regular physics book is not too exciting, however, Gamow puts the book in a more colorful spin that allows the reader to stay interested and actually follow the idea content. Without this twist I do not believe I would have endured the book till the end. Not only that, but Gamow putting the little spin of Mr. Tompkins meeting Mrs. Tompkins is just a precious ending. At least Gamow could attract many audiences. I also felt that I learned a lot from this read. Gamow did a great job introducing the information and arranging the content into a building block learning experience. As mentioned, not only was physics introduced, but Gamow made sure to teach quite a bit of chemistry and to make sure at atom was understood. This particular subject was a couple chapters long. The different safaris Mr. Tompkins went on helped certain confusing aspects to be cleared up for example, the relativity principle. Gamow really illustrated how these principles can only be relative to (in the instance of this book) Mr. Tompkins.In all, I found this book to be quite helpful and interesting. Would I read it again? Probably not, but it still shows how well thought out this book was and how creative Gamow was, in that, he could create an entire story based on complicated physic theories. If needing some extra help on physic concepts, this is a great introductory course. After all, like the professor said, \\"Curiosity makes a scientist.\\""},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Mr. Tompkins in Paperback\\". In this book George Gamow takes difficult physics principles and makes them easier to understand. The author's method of simplifying physics is by comparing physics principles with real life examples that are easier to see.The part of this book that I enjoyed the most is when Mr. Tompkins has a dream about relativity. In his dream, Mr. Tompkins goes to a world where the speed of light is greatly reduced. While there, Mr. Tompkins noticed a bicyclist coming towards him. The bicyclist appeared to be thinner. This is because in Mr. Tompkins reference frame, the size of the bicyclist has been contracted because he is traveling at a speed that is close to the speed of light. Later, Mr. Tompkins got on a bike and then noticed that everything around him appeared to be shorter. This can be explained by considering the reference frame of Mr. Tompkins. In that reference frame, the space around him is contracted. I think that these examples used in this book will make it a lot easier for me to remember these principles of relativity that involve length contraction.Another part of the book that I found really interesting is when Mr. Tompkins sees a game of \\"quantum billiards\\". In that game, when a ball gets hit, it spreads out and goes in all directions. The author uses this comparison to describe quantum mechanics and the probability of where things are located. I also found it interesting when Mr. Tompkins puts the pool ball inside of a triangle to see what would happen. He finds that it is impossible to get a ball to stop completely. Mr. Tompkins also notices that the pool balls can \\"leak\\" out of the wooden triangle. I found this to be very interesting when comparing this phenomenon with quantum mechanics.Overall, \\"Mr. Tompkins in Paperback\\" was an interesting and educating book to read. I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"I am a retired college professor and nuclear physicist.

I am pleased that these books have been reprinted, and I recommend this book to anyone interested in physics, even though it is over sixty years old."},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"If you think physics is boring, get this book. You'll enjoy everyday stories merged with relativity theory, quantum physics, etc."},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland was a good read. It describes some principles of physics that are typically difficult to understand to the average person in a playful, simple way. The story illustrates the adventurous dreams of Mr. Tompkins after he attends a series of physics lectures given by a local professor. In one of his dreams he sees an expanding universe where some of the physical laws of gravity have been altered. In another he enters a billiards hall where the \\"quantum constant\\" has a different value then ours, causing him to see a blur of different balls as they travel across the table. This has reference to atomic theory, where we become increasingly uncertain of an objects velocity as we become more certain of its location and vice versa. He visits this world again with the professor and sees a blur of tigers and gazelle which are near impossible to hunt. In another world he sees the speed of light has been altered to a mere 10 mph. Here he learns firsthand how the laws of relativity are experienced. While he travels at the speed of light, he notices his time passes much slower than to those stationary around him. All these physics concepts become very real to him in his dreams. Lucky for Mr. Tompkins, he gets the girl in the end; who new physics could open up romantic options?!This book was a pleasureable read. It was generally simple to understand after reading the chapters. While I enjoyed this short story, I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because I realize that such a book is not for everyone. The writing is understandable one who is at least somewhat familiar with the principles involved. Luckily the appendix offers the text of the lectures upon which Mr. Tompkins' dreams are based. One should be at least have heard of some of the principles behind quantum theory and relativity to get the best benefit out of this book."},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"Mr. Tomkins in Paperback, by George Gamow, is an excellent book for anyone looking to broaden their knowledge of how science applies to the real world.After having read this book for my physics class, I feel that this book deserves a 3.5 out of 5 stars.In particular, Gamow focuses this book on the study of physics using his character C.G.H. Tomkins (even the initials of Mr. Tomkins are derived from concepts of physics). Mr. Tomkins, a bank clerk by trade, is a curious man who decides to jazz up his life a little and attend physics lectures instead of going out or going to the movies. He has a strange desire to learn more about modern science. In his first lecture he falls asleep and enters into his own \\"Narnia\\" (in his dreams) where the concepts of physics are real and magnified, so that they appear almost supernatural. Thankfully the professor is there to help and explain things to Mr. Tomkins along the way. As Mr. Tomkins explores this realm of physics he encounters some danger and excitement in his adventures. However, he never fails to take home the message of each situation and ends up learning through his experiences. This book covers several topics such as relativity, space curves, gravity, and more. Mr. Tomkins learns not only about physics but also of love as he meets the professor's daughter.I enjoyed reading this book and surprisingly, for being a science related book, it was an easy to understand and quick read (the hardbound version contains only 186 pages with many illustrations to help the reader visualize different situations). This book helped me understand many concepts I have learned about in my college level course as it explains them in a simple and concise manner. However, some concepts can seem over the top and overwhelming, because not all are explained so clearly (like the topic of relativity related to motion where Mr.Tomkins meets the anti-aging-grandpa coming off the train). But this shouldn't be the determining factor whether or not you will read this book, when reading any book there is always something to be learned. One thing I really liked about the book is that Gamow used mini stories to explain concepts, but the fact that he keeps them short helps in the understanding process and keeps the book interesting. Overall, having the principles and concepts of physics explained to me in \\"real life\\" or \\"everyday\\" terms helped me better understand physics and how it can be applied in all aspects of life. Would I read this book again(?) Probably not anytime soon, but it was strangely interesting and even sparked a small interest in physics.

P. PalmerThis book should be on any science teacher's bookshelf: it is inexpensive and a delight to read. Firstly, however a little information about the publication.1. This small paperback volume contains not one but two separate books. Mr Tompkins in Wonderland was originally published by Cambridge University Press in 1940. Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom was published by Cambridge University Press in 1944. The two volumes have been through different editions and reprints ever since and in 1994, Cambridge University Press marked more than half a century of Mr Tompkins by bringing out a joint paperback volume of all the Mr Tomkins stories.2. Mr Tomkins in Wonderland explains Einstein's theory of relativity. Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom explains atomic structure and some of the ideas of quantum mechanics. He does this through the introduction of three main characters, Mr Tompkins, a clerk in a big city bank, with an interest in, but little knowledge of, science and a strong propensity to fall asleep and dream during the \\"Professor's\\" scientific lectures, the \\"Professor\\", who gives the scientific explanations, and his daughter Maude, who develops a romantic attachment to Mr Tompkins.3. Relativity and quantum mechanics are explained very well through these stories and Roger Penrose in the introduction states that with a few minor exceptions these stories still give a useful explanation of these 'difficult to grasp' concepts.4. Gamow wrote the first of the Mr Tompkins stories in 1938 and was unsuccessful in finding a publisher. Eventually he offered it to C. P. Snow, who then edited Discovery and who published it and subsequent Mr Tompkins stories in Discovery.5. The original illustrations were drawn by John Hookham, but after Hookham had retired, Gamow did subsequent drawings himself following Hookham's style.I suggest that the whole new volume would be very suitable for teachers who want a reasonably accessible explanation of relativity or quantum mechanics or for interested students in Years 9-12.Original review in The Journal of the Science Teacher Association of the Northern Territory, Volume 14, pp.134-135.BILL PALMER"},{"Title":"Mr Tompkins in Paperback (Canto imprint) (containing Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom)","review":"George Gamow, an absolute physics legend of the mid-twentieth century, has a classic here with Mr. Tompkins in Paperback. The book covers many of the things that you'd like to know about physics and the physical world (but may have been afraid to ask); and covers them through the prose of the affable Mr. Tompkins. Mr. Tompkins keeps the book moving from topic to topic as he gets his education in physics, and all the while the reader finds him- or herself (of course) getting the same education. In this way, Mr. Tompkins is a narrative device to make learning physics non-threatening.

The original edition has been out of print for a number of years. This 1993 edition has added commentary and a fascinating bio of Gamow. He was born in Odessa, in what was then Russia, --before the Soviet Union. The story of his escape to the West is straight out of a thriller. Only it is real! Gamow was referred to by a journalist, some time during the Cold War, as &quot;the only scientist in America with a real sense of humor&quot;. He can take the most technical stuff and make it simple. Fun too! The book:--Intellectual treats, whimsy, but deep. Illustrated with lovely drawings by Gamow himself. Much of it can be understood by a child, and other parts might require a little concentration. All of it is great fun. Follow your imagination, and while you explore, you will learn about Einstein's theory of relativity. And in unexpected ways! You will see the wonders of physics thru the eyes of a child. With his unexpected thought experiments, Gamow has captured the imagination of generations of readers, and he has inspired a degree of curiosity that comes naturally to children.The author George Gamow started in nuclear physics, during the Golden Age of Physics, worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, then later in the US, on the Manhattan Project during WWII; and after the War, he was professor in Boulder Colorado. He has a building on campus of The University of Colorado named after him! He is one of the few scientists who wrote popular books. They are precious pearls, and they have been equally popular with my parent's generation as with mine. For awhile they were out of print, but luckely some have now been reprinted in recent years!Other Gamow titles: Biography of Physics, Atomic Energy [dedicated to the hope of lasting peace], Physics of the Strapless Evning Gown,...We are lucky that Dover has reprinted some of them. Gamow's list of scientific accomplishments includes a 1948 landmark paper on the origin of chemical elements, the Big Bang model, and later work with F.

Without compromising scientific accuracy, he manages to make his narrative engaging and entertaining.Gamow touches on some classical topics, as well as relativity and quantum mechanics. For instance, he explains probability theory and how it relates to thermodynamics using a vignette about a gambling system to win at Monte Carlo.The author, renowned for his contributions to 20th Century physics and to its popular exposition, assumes a fair amount of sophistication on the part of the reader.

An earlier reviewer has suggested that this book be produced as an animated educational film, a good idea, but I picture it as being more of a computer enhanced live action video. The chapters on relativistic geometries and cosmological models could really be audio-visual treats, and it's hard to imagine a better basis for a script explaining the strange new world of physics to the interested lay public. The lions-share of what science now claims to know about the world was developed from a seemingly strange handful of theories thrashed out in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Gamow was both a party to this theoretical explosion and a gifted writer. Most of what has occurred in physics since these books were first published, has essentially been the refining of the ideas discussed here, so, for the most part, the science is still significant. But while Gamow had some important cosmological ideas -- he predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation, the discovery of which earned Wilson and Penzias a Noble Prize (in which Gamow should have shared, but did not) -- he also bet on the wrong horse when it came to cosmological models.Gamow cleverly and artfully presents the three basic cosmological models being argued from the 1930s through 1965.* The context is a night at the opera in which noted physicists sing the virtues of their respective theoretical opinions. First up is no other than the initial developer of the expanding universe ('big bang') model, the Belgian physicist and cleric, A. George Lemaitre. The Lemaitre universe is a majestically wondrous, one-off, elegant masterpiece. He sings, \\"Z' splendeur of z' origine. . . Worrk of Z' Lorrd!\\" Second is the oscillating or 'bouncing' model, and this piece is sung by Gamow, who at that time favored the concept of an eternally recycling universe (bang, expand, contract, re-bang, expand, contract, ->, etc). The third and last piece to be sung is of the Bondi-Gold self-maintaining or \\"steady state\\" universe, so famously preferred by Hoyle. Appropriately, this singer is generated mysteriously from intergalactic space, singing \\"Was never formed in time gone by. . . But is, has been. . .shall ever be. . .\\"Well, on this question we seem to have a winner, and no, it isn't Gamow's model. As Roger Penrose relates in the foreword, Gamow's bouncing universe and Hoyle's \\"steady state\\" model are both dead ducks these days. Seventy-five years of observation and mathematical fine-tuning have made something like Lemaitre's general understanding look like the only serious cosmological game in town. But don't hold that against this artful and thoroughly fun book. Gamow discounted the 'steady state', and most of the science here is still sound and relevant.*[File this under 'is there nothing new under the sun?': 1600 years ago, Augustine of Hippo recorded (City of God, Book XII) that classical cosmographies all distil into three basic models, the same three considered here by Gamow. (These same three models subsume the \\"innumerable universes\\" of Epicurus' speculation and of the recently famous so-called 'strong anthropic principle'.) Augustine bet on the right horse though, reasoning that the 'cycling' and 'eternal' models both seek finally to avoid rather than admit a true explanation. Only the universe-from-nothing (ex nihilo) model admits that the universe has an explanation -- albeit a grandly mysterious one.]This volume is classic science writing in a most entertaining package, it awaits some creative screenplay adaptor and video genius to make from it the best popular science audio-visual experience ever.

The tricky part in this hit-and-rum was reported to the police, so paying the victim could be obstruction of justice. Chapter 2 discusses the pattern of life in a big city, and common automobile injury cases. Lam finds the accident victim, and buys the assignment of this suit. The victim takes the money and flies to Denver. But there is a big problem the next day; Sergeant Frank Sellers shows up to confront Lam about this deal. Lam must give up confidential information or be arrested the next day for compounding a felony!Lam uses this time to try to track down Mr. Dawson in Denver. Next he tries to locate the missing accident victim. Lam tracks down Mr. Dawson through a clever ruse and is told the truth about the accident. But Lam is not out of trouble yet. Like other stories, it involves events that are seldom reported in your local newspapers. On a flight Lam finds a friendly stranger who asks personal questions, and guesses correctly about Lam's personal life. Lam guesses who this could be.Chapter 19 tells how this story ends by the sanitized version printed in the newspapers. Lam collects his fee and leaves for a sudden vacation.

Lam is to visit an accident victim and arrange a deal so this can be settled out of court. The tricky part in this hit-and-rum was reported to the police, so paying the victim could be obstruction of justice. Chapter 2 discusses the pattern of life in a big city, and common automobile injury cases. Lam finds the accident victim, and buys the assignment of this suit. The victim takes the money and flies to Denver. But there is a big problem the next day; Sergeant Frank Sellers shows up to confront Lam about this deal. Lam must give up confidential information or be arrested the next day for compounding a felony!Lam uses this time to try to track down Mr. Dawson in Denver. Next he tries to locate the missing accident victim. Lam tracks down Mr. Dawson through a clever ruse and is told the truth about the accident. But Lam is not out of trouble yet. Like other stories, it involves events that are seldom reported in your local newspapers. On a flight Lam finds a friendly stranger who asks personal questions, and guesses correctly about Lam's personal life. Lam guesses who this could be.Chapter 19 tells how this story ends by the sanitized version printed in the newspapers. Lam collects his fee and leaves for a sudden vacation. Like other stories, this provides a subtle critique of the manners and morals of the rich and famous.

If the detail worked out here, after the law of correspondences, aids the reader to read better between the lines of the _SECRET DOCTRINE_ the purpose is served.\\"The reader is advised hereby to read the following books beforehand so that he may be benefitted better by reading this book:1. _The Secret Doctrine_ by H. P. B.2. _Masters and the Path_, by C. W. Leadbeater.3. _Chakras_, by C. W. Leadbeater.4. _Ancient Wisdom_, by Annie Besant.5. _Echoes from the Orient_, by W. Q. Judge.6. _Initiation, Human and Solar_, by Alice A. Bailey.[PAGE viii]7. _Esoteric Astrology_, by Alice A. Bailey.8. _The Art of Synthesis_, by Alan Leo.9. _Progressed Horoscope_, by Alan Leo.\\"Even if one reads this book directly he will clearly understand every point, _BUT IN HIS OWN WAY_. Unlocking the keys of the stories that contain the secrets of eternal wisdom was one of the main purposes of H. P. B. The present work carries that purpose to its legitimate end. Astrological key is inevitable to read the scriptures of the world and understand them in a proper manner. This work is an attempt on those lines.\\"The book's entire (concise and pithy!) introduction:\\"The seers of all times believe that wisdom is ageless and impersonal. The intensity and the vastness of wisdom is dependent upon the vision of the observer of the universe. The point of view decides the nature of the horizon that surrounds the observer as _Maya_. The whole universe is only one, in the sense that it is one among the series of universes. A universe is defined as a unity of wisdom in which there is a diversity of levels. What we see around us is a huge globe of space with the observer at its geometrical centre. The centre of consciousness of the observer is the key to unlock the secrets of wisdom. By this process of unlocking, the individual pervades into the whole universe. Only when there is an individual, with the objectified self as the universe before him, there is the process of unfolding into wisdom. Therefore, it is propounded that the individual and the universe put together form the two complementarities of the _one whole_. This double unit is called _wisdom_.\\"As we observe the horizon around us we realise that it is a horizon relative to the observer. To itself there is no horizon. The earth and the heaven appear to meet along the ring of horizon. In fact they do not meet, but in truth they meet to form a symbol through which the individual derives his wisdom. The space represents the subtle state of matter and the earth represents the gross state. The union which is apparent produces the apparent state of the individual. Here we find the birth of symbolism and the beginning of a process through which the individual unfolds into wisdom. This process of unfoldment is said to have six approaches which serve as six keys to wisdom. Astrology is one among them and forms the true key. Astrology is of two types, Esoteric and Exoteric. It is with the esoteric branch of astrology that the true spiritual wisdom of man is concerned and we call this branch of astrology by the name of Spiritual Astrology. This science proposes that the individual is three-fold in his phenomenal existence: matter, mind and spirit. In him these principles form his body, mind and spirit from which his consciousness radiates.\\"As we observe the sky at night, we find innumerable stars, apparently having no order. Each star is a sun like the sun of our solar system. Each sun is the radiation of the inner spiritual sun who is invisible and who is the real sun. This, the real sun, corresponds to the radiating center of consciousness in man. The rays of the sun come out only as a reflection on the gross plane of their existence. This principle of reflection is the symbol of the universal mind and is called the moon-principle. Our visible moon in the sky is only a body containing a moon-principle to this earth because he reflects the rays of the sun upon this earth. In the individual, this moon-principle corresponds to his reflection or idea. This principle is called 'Mind'. Apart from these two things, the sun has a shape and a colour. This aspect is called 'Matter'. In us, this corresponds to our physical body. These three principles form the three great symbols to man on this earth. They are the solar, the lunar and the material principles which are symbolised by the sun, the moon and this earth. Every solar system has got its own earth besides other planets and every earth has its own moon. [My note: it is to be understood that many of these features are not currently in perceivable material manifestation.]\\"The entire (again, concise and pithy) second section of the first chapter:\\"2. THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT\\"Spiritual astrology deals with the spiritual evolution of man. For this, a definite idea of the spiritual order of the universe and the solar system is necessary. The relationship between the universe and the individual is only a matter of correspondences as we have seen previously. An individual becomes _self-conscious_ through some definite steps which are natural. At first the individual distinguishes himself from other beings and this individualisation makes him live in a world which is a bit higher than that of the animal world. From individual consciousness a man unfolds into the consciousness of personality. This process is through his experience through the senses and sensations. At this stage, he lives below the levels of his solar plexus. Food and protection form his motives of action. During the personality-level his mental vehicle is stimulated through desire and experience. At this stage, his consciousness is located between the solar plexus and the throat-centre _via_ the heart-centre. During this period his emotions and thoughts are blended. He finds an expression through the experience of mental and emotional relationships with others. In the next step his intellect is purified. His thoughts are freed from motives and his emotions are purified into love. At this stage, the lower centers gradually lose their control, and his consciousness gains possession of the higher centres. The centre of consciousness is shifted from the personality-level to the soul-level. during this period, the minor initiations take place. His consciousness begins to take possession of his throat- and _Ajna_-centres. His relationships with others are only in the group-level because there are no motives. He learns to live with the one Higher Soul of the _greater intelligences_ at work on this earth. In the next stage, the evolution is from soul to spirit, that is, from the one soul to the parent-soul of this solar system and above. Spiritual astrology gives direct light concerning these steps of unfolding. The following phenomena take place during the above-said steps:\\"(1) When one lives in the individual level, in every birth, the twelve houses of his horoscope wield their influence through the twelve departments of the individual life. The whole globe of the apparent space around him is made to have a symbolic beginning from his ascendant and to travel through the zodiacal signs _via_ his twelve houses. The signs and the planets influence him only through his twelve houses.\\"(2) When the individual unfolds into the personality-level, gradually the houses cease to exist for him. It is only the planets and the twelve signs that stimulate him into the work of the world. Aries works as the first house, Taurus as the second house and so on. Another important and interesting change takes place at this stage. The position of his birth Moon works as his ascendant and from that point there is some influence (only on the mental and astral planes) which divides the zodiac into the twelve houses of his personality. If you take the Moon as his ascendant and construct the twelve houses, that will be his horoscope for mental and astral influences. The Sun in his horoscope works as another ascendant (for purposes of objective and mundane spheres) and there is another set of twelve houses from his Sun, working upon his vocational and social spheres.\\"(3) In the third stage of his unfolding, his birth ascendant again takes hold of his consciousness; but, this time the ascendant does not denote his physical existence. It marks the plan of his soul. He will be highly influenced on the soul-level by the sign and the degree of his ascendant. This is because the birth ascendant is nothing but the position of his Moon at the time of fertilisation preceding his birth. The _kama_ and the _sankalpa_ of the parents give him this sign and the degree through the mind (Moon) of the parents. This results in his physical body which is his ascendant. But here at this stage of evolution, his real body or vehicle of expression is his soul and not his physical body. Hence his soul is influenced by his _Lagna _ at this stage. There is another interesting point also worth noticing here. The course of his soul does not follow the planetary path of the zodiacal signs. It follows the path of the higher sun, or the equinox. Therefore for a proper understanding of his further path, the ascendant should be progressed backwards. The path is from Aries to Pisces and so on. His ascendant meets the aspects of the other planets in a receding order of direction which will be explained later.\\"(4) In the fourth stage, the ascendant, the Moon, and the Sun form the three centres of working. His life is guided by the planetary principles as angels and not planets. There are three main centres through which the cosmic energy contacts him. In the cosmic plan, there are three great forces which are beyond the planetary level. These are the solar, the lunar, and the earth principles. These principles are the cause of the planetary creation in each solar system. Every planet and its every atom contain these principles. They are explained, in detail, in the next chapter. In the horoscope of a disciple who has attained this fourth stage, his birth Sun works as his solar-principle, his birth Moon as his lunar-principle, and his ascendant as his earth-principle. He gains mastery over these principles and creates through them in tune with the cosmic plan. He attains the level of a worker with the higher beings. At this stage only, the aspects between the planets that occur during the progressions of his retrograde horoscope respond. The Sun and the Moon stimulate him only through the new moon and the full moon and the half-moons. The ascendant influences him only through its rotation along the four cardinal points of the day (the east, the meridian, the west, and the nadir).\\"These four stages form the main content of spiritual astrology. A thorough explanation of these stages, as far as it is possible at present, will be given in this book.\\""},{"Title":"The Flying Dinosaurs: The Illustrated Guide to the Evolution of Flight","review":"I purchased this book in the badlands of Alberta, where Phil Currie works, and was immediately inspired by his arguments for the connections between several lineages of dinosaurs and the evolution of birds. Following the introductory text, in one spectacular portrait after another, is a wonderful exhibition of the great variety of mesozoic bird fossils, reconstructed by illustrator Jan Sovak. The book is a bargain for the color reproductions alone, with the cogent writing of Dr. Currie adding the flesh and bone commentary on the fossil record.The first half of the book develops a picture of the characteristics of flying animals, and, in particular, flying reptiles (pterosaurs), taking their story into full profusion of types and habitats. Over a dozen species are put into the spotlight, accompanied by Sovak's dramatic and vivid full-page illustrations for each species. After a brief review of the branching of dinosaur families, using the up-to-date cladistic approach, the full panoply of fossil birds is set forth in the last half of the book. The familiar one is here, Archaeopteryx, but then so many more, toothed and toothless, winged and flightless. The examples of early diving birds, from 80 million years ago in Kansas, with teeth in their beaks, are a startling reminder of how old the cormorant really is. The story ends with examples of more recent fossil birds, moa or less, and their life styles, including a &quot;living fossil&quot;, the hoatzin, whose young have claws on the leading edge of their wings, like the feathered Archaeopteryx of 100 million years before.The connection between birds and specific dinosaur families is well-presented, but the level of controversy is played down. More recent debate, for example in Audubon magazine, March 1997, is better balanced but also shows even more solid bird/dino evidence. Currie's Flying Dinosaurs now looks like it was 10 years ahead of its time.I have two heroes in paleontology: Jack Horner in Montana and Phil Currie, just north of the border, in Alberta. Both are active in the here and now, and both dwell in the Cretaceous. For the lives of dinosaurs and their geologic setting, read Horner's Digging Dinosaurs, and for a complete and concise setting for the origin of birds, read this book, The Flying Dinosaurs. And don't forget to admire the imaginative illustrations."},{"Title":"A Short History of Australia (A Mentor book)","review":"The late Manning Clark was the worst historian Australia ever produced.

He goes into a detailed analysis of his beliefs and he reflects the thinking of his times. His story then goes into detail of his exploits as the greatest privateer in the history of naval warfare. Had he been on the winning side his name would be mentioned in the same breath as Grant and Sherman. Can anyone name one US naval officer that served in the civil war? His story takes the reader from Annapolis to New Orleans to the South Pacific to Gibraltar and to the final demise of the CSS Alabama off the coast of France. His tale explains his actions and defends them with an indepth look at maritime law. He explains the laws involved with a detail and style that makes it easy for anyone to understand. His story should not be allowed to fade into past. It is something from a terrible time that should be looked at by naval officers today. He is a man to be honored, not cast away as a pirate"},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"Semmes, a lawyer by trade, explains the reason why he resigns from the U.S. Navy to join the C.S. Navy. He explains why the Southern states disolve their union with the Northern states. The reason was an issue of states rights, not slavery as our children have been brain washed into believing. He explains as only a lawyer could the fact that all of the states joined in a union of common defense. They then formed a central government. They gave this central government limited powers. When the Southern states decided that this government was not responding to their needs they removed themselves from the union that they willingly joined. Semmes explains that the Federal government unlawfully forced the Southern states back into the union. The issue of states rights is still of importance to those of us who believe that the Federal government is slowly taxing us to death and eating away at our constitutional rights"},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"The only bad thing I can say about this book is that on a very few occasions Semmes tends to get into some scholarly explanations about natural phenomena that, while interesting, slow the pace of the reading some.Otherwise, Semmes tells of his adventures on the high seas with clarity and wit. The book's first few chapters give his legally sound (Semmes was also a lawyer) justifications of the Southern case for secession and his participation in the preparation for equipping a navy from practically nothing.The Alabama's defeat of the iron-plated USS Hatteras and the final battle with the USS Kearsarge are there in detail in addition to the tale of her very successful commerce raiding upon the civilian commerce of the North.Contrary to the rabid Northern newspapers of the time, Semmes reveals himself and his officers to be the gentlemanly knights of the high seas in stark contrast to the conniving Federal consuls who, in nearly every port, attempted to foil the Confederate sailors' coaling and supplying of the ship despite international maritime law that allowed it.Semmes most effectively fought the mercantile world empire of the Union, all the while working within the confines of maritime law. (The few actions of his that were officially disputed were eventually settled in his favour.) This, again, is in contrast to the Federal navy that, under Welles' and Seward's leadership, played the bully and ignored international law when it was inconvenient.The CSS Alabama (along with a few other CS ships) virtually shut down the US merchant marine -- a blow from which it never fully recovered. His fight with the Kearsarge proved to be the last best use of a ship that was otherwise bound to be blockaded in port by the Federal navy (that proved itself remarkably inept, apparently cowardly, and negligent in its mission to stop Semmes)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"I found this book to be a refreshing insight into the exploits of one of the most interesting naval men of his era. Semmes comes across as a man that prizes duty to his beliefs as the soul motivation to his actions. This dispels any of the myth that he was a pirate as often historicaly believed.While many pages are devoted to navigation and tidal patterns,which can be a bit boring to the non-seaman, the book is excellent overall."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"In another life Semmes might have been a poet or artist. Circumstances forced him to become the greatest seaman in the 19th century. I have read from an independant source that Kaiser Wilhelm insisted his high ranking officers read this book in preperation for the First World War. The Norths hypocracy is shameful. This book is by far the greatest review written by anyone on either side of the war. Sadly political correctness has kept Semmes greatness buried at this point."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"This is an extremely well written and fascinating memoir. Semmes was obviously a very intelligent man with a strong interest in the sciences, particularly meteorology and oceanography. Of course, as a ship's captain, he had need to understand these sciences. His descriptions are vivid and his experiences afloat in the service of the Confederacy are enthralling. He also cuts clearly through the myth of the history of the union concerning the war and clearly shows for what the Confederacy stood and the issues of conflict between the two sides. The book is highly recommended to both those interested in the War for Southern Independence and those who just want to read an excellent historical adventure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Service Afloat During the War between the States","review":"He was my (2) great- grandfather and I've read all of his writings as well as the numerous biographies written on him.

The gods smiled on me the day I found this brilliant book hiding in my local bookstore. I read the first page, marvelled at the low cost of the book and bought it. I laughed, cried and laughed when I read it. I then promptly read it again. The characters are very well thought out, and I am thinking of changing my name to 'Tuberski'. Why this book is not a best seller and hasn't been snapped up for film rights is beyond me. I like the descriptions of Northern California(?), it sounds like a good place to live. This book made me want to do silly things like write letters of praise to the author and shout how good it was (the book that is)from the top of the nearest hill(!). Do you get the feeling that John Boston knows something about the sasquatch that most of the rest of the world doesn't. Has he written any other novels or short stories? Finally 'foof' has become a permanent part of my dictionary. Thank you John and please hurry up with the next novel.

I walked past it everyday and it always caught my eye so I finally bought it. This may be the best book I have ever read.

It has gotten to the point that when I read this book, I actually visualize it as a movie with Bruce Campbell playing the main character Michael Fenberg and Janine Turner as Elaine Mitikitski(oh if it would only happen). It's a truly visualizing book from the reflections of Tuberski's See-Em-Dead Zoo Bar and Grill Massacre to Fenberg's giant truck to the Mogonogonovich Brothers brutish antics; it's a riot and so enjoyable. You'll read this book until it falls apart (then you'll tape it together over and over again).I have recommend this book to numerous people and all of them are grateful for having got it. I got my wife to read it and well to make a long story short, we read it so often that I've had to buy three replacements because they get worn out (my prize one is I managed to snag a John Boston autographed copy).

Before it is over, you have murders, humor, romance, comedy and even a werewolf! Holy smoke!

My then teenage daughter was looking for Tic comic books...lo and behold the fellow had a few paperbacks and this was one of them. I read all the 'come on' stuff and was intrigued...I didn't pay two dollars for it. I began reading it when we got home; then I couldn't put it down. I remember my daughter's repeated trips to the living room from her bedroom asking me what was so funny. I couldn't answer her because I was laughing so hard tears were coming down my cheeks. I tried reading her the passage that had got me going and I couldn't...I'd dissolve into laughter once again...it's hard to read when you can't breathe and are doubled over.Well, it's 15 years later and it's still just as funny and fresh as the first time I read Sasquatch. I read it at least twice yearly and have my 90 year old mother reading it as well. She asks to borrow the book at least once a year. I met my husband that same year and while discussing our favorite authors and books I excitedly told him he HAD to read this book I'd found. Well, you guessed it, David had already bought it...this was a sign!! since most people have never heard of this book!!Like others here, I have no idea why Hollywood hasn't picked up the rights to Sasquatch...what a great movie this could be! David and I would sit and have 'casting' discussions...what actor would be best as Michale, or John, etc. At the time, I would have loved to see Tom Hanks play Mikey...he's too old now.Well, I'm here to buy a second copy as my first is getting quite fragile from all the use.

We all accept on at least a superficial level that women are different from men, and that their biology is unique and specific, but we often fail to know just how and where those differences are. In the history of western medicine many strictly feminine characteristics have been explained by men in masculine terms, and this book does not do that.Other recent books on about women rhapsodize or celebrate the female body, but this one explains it. This is not a roadmap or a geography, this is an owners manual-like an owners manual for a high performance, sleek and exciting sports car-and like any maintenance manual for an exotic and tempestuous machine, it makes for interesting reading even if you don't happen to own one.As a practical matter this manual should be in the hands of all the owners-young to old-and read by all those who love them."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes, Locke and some guy with a name like Machiavelli (or some such) were to the Framers what the Framers were to today's legislators - relatively God-like.

What inflamed peoples passion so, in this seventeenth century book? It was governement and religion, of course. Hobbes, who was a private tutor for a wealthy family for most of his career (until he fled the country, that is), picks apart both the why-to of government and its use of manipulations, and the nature of humanity and the mechanisms, he proponents, whereby it operates. And that is just the first hundred pages in this volume.It seems Hobbes intent was to refute the conscience, and instead say that everything was an opinion of the person wishing to act ever which way. This would be false however, because Hobbes himself is an exception to his rule for he has set himself up in the role of The Great Observer, or God.In any which way, it was an interesting read and I recommend it for those who are looking for Order within the chaos.I also recommmend in relation to this book is Joseph Butler's book Five Sermons, edited by Stephen Darwall, which stands as a refutation of some of Hobbes ideas and was written in the very ealry 1700s."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"I assert that this work of Thomas Hobbes is amazing.

I would suggest the opposite, if our very simple thinking and poor intellectual abilities do not allow us to crack it open at the first attempt we should keep trying. That effort is what keep us moving forward.Great book, needless to say. Take your time and enjoy. If it gets difficult just leave it on the table, think about it and read it later.

Firstly I admire Thomas Hobbes for his bravery during the 17th century when this book was written and secondly for his grim view of humanity. Atheism during the height of the Catholic Church was strictly taboo and he had to write this piece very cleverly. Leviathan is a must for those whom are interested in the philosophical ideology of who we are and what makes us strive for things that we do and generally what makes us as men tick.This book is complex. The common &quot;run-on&quot; sentences used in philosophy and the Old English style makes the book difficult to understand at times. It almost seems to be pure thought with no organization which has been jotted down in 728 pages.In all, I like to call Hobbes Leviathan the &quot;Atheists Bible&quot; (though perhaps Hobbes would not like this type of name for one of his works) and I truly believe that this work is just as essential and important to philosophy as Plato."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"I got interested in Hobbes because I was reading a lot about the Founding Fathers of the United States and I wanted to familiarize myself with the books that influenced them.Reading Leviathan is not easy.

Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not think much about the origins of government. In Hobbes we find the concepts that have become standard in political thought: state of nature, social contract, absolute and limited government, civil disobedience, censorship, etc.Hobbes supposes that the organized state is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\", where there is both a \\"right of nature\\" and \\"laws of nature\\". Hobbes uses these terms in a highly individual way. The \\"right of nature\\" is \\"the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own Life\\". In addition there are a number of \\"laws of nature\\". The first dictates that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and the second is that each person should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These (and other laws that follow from them) are found by reason and are utilitarian rather than prudential. Morality does not enter into it. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their \\"rights of nature\\" in exchange for others doing likewise is the best means of self-preservation, even though it is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Reason suggests advantages stem from co-operation, but this is outweighed by instinct. Men are fundamentally competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability so no one person or group can impose his will on others, and all can hope only to protect themselves from others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Hence men are driven to create government via a pact with all others to give up their \\"right of nature\\" to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Hobbes' view of human nature is such that he allocates absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government is unworkable for men are too prone to division and selfishness, and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Hobbes was influenced by the divisive years before the English Civil War in which he lived. Among the ten rights Hobbes awards the sovereign the sixth is the power of censorship of opinions harmful to the state. Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal. Had Hobbes lived a century later religion would have played little or no part in his thinking because he was not himself a religious man, and he was concerned with religion only because because it played a major role in politics in his lifetime.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural rights to self-preservation to a sovereign to better achieve them. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that self-preservation then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes says that a criminal going to his execution has the \\"right\\" to resist. He is not, however, saying he has a \\"moral\\" right, only that it is proper for him to seek to assert his \\"natural\\" right, adding that the sovereign should indeed execute him. As for whether men have the right to resist conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of that state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand that I lay down my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government. Those who prefer a version with modernized spelling should consider the edition edited by Gaskin."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.

Without cooperation, there would be no such thing as society (and so no social sciences, philosophy, history, etc.). Hobbes was the first political theorist to tackle this question.While Hobbes is long-winded in parts, and his spelling and grammar not consistent with modern standards, this book is still worth reading. Alfred North Whitehead quipped that the entire history of western political philosophy consists of footnotes to Plato. I respectfully differ, as I believe Plato is now studied purely for historical interest (nobody takes seriously his ideal of a 3 class society led by philosopher kings). Hobbes, however, is the root from which all subsequent western political philosophy has sprung. Locke's Treatises were a direct response to Hobbes, and helped solidify the social contract tradition. Nowadays, nearly all western political theorists either accept social contract theory, or at least have to discuss it in-depth in order to show why they reject it.Hobbes examines the fundamental issue of \\"how do humans manage to get along peacefully?\\" In an age of terrorism, serial killers and vicious divorce battles, it's still a good question. Obviously humans do get along together most of the time, but that doesn't make it obvious why or how we do.You don't have to accept Hobbes's ideas to get a lot out of this book. His stark contrast in describing the alternatives available to humans is unparalleled. While evolutionary theory has gone a long way toward scientifically explaining some types of cooperation, it still hasn't fully explained how strangers in a large society manage to cooperate when, in strictly rational terms, it would be advantageous to screw each other over. So if Hobbes didn't satisfactorily answer the question either, he at least made a very compelling argument."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"I have serious issues getting past the misspellings and the psychotic notions of Hobbes (or the translator's doing as far as spelling is concern). It is most nonsensical in the 1st part of the book and the religiousity is driving me crazy as I force myself to continue reading ... and to think I have to write an essay on this book. Yipes!"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"It normally takes me 2 weeks to finish a book considering that life must be lived. For whatever reason, \\"Leviathan\\" took me nearly 2 months. I think I can attribute it mostly to the fact that what I expected to read was not what I did read. I expected \\"Leviathan\\" to be a secular treatise on government. Instead, \\"Leviathan\\" read as a Christian indicting the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Not that I have an issue with that, but I order my reading list in a special way and my mood was set on government not religion at the time.I have no authority or scholarship in regards to philosophy. I am simply an enthusiast. I had general knowledge of Thomas Hobbes prior to reading this book. Many scholars claim that Hobbes was a secular absolutist, materialist, agnostic, or perhaps an atheist. If they were reading \\"Leviathan\\" to gather this information, I do believe there would be a significant amount of proof to say otherwise.Leviathan is Hobbes' \\"Utopia.\\" It is indeed absolutist, but it is voluntary absolutism, and in no way secular. He refers to it as his Christian-Commonwealth numerous times. His knowledge and application of scripture is impeccable. I take no offense to Hobbes' vision, being an Anarcho-Capitalist-Voluntaryist-Minarchist-leaning Libertarian, because Hobbes' vision is voluntary for the most part. He is by no means a one-worlder. He believes that there should be multiple common-wealths and that they should form according to each common-wealths' desires. Enter his disdain for the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. He makes some incredible and withstanding accusations against the Church and its desire for world domination.Leviathan is a Christian-Commonwealth in which the people contract their governing to a King. A King who is chosen by them voluntarily. He makes some compelling arguments as to why there should be a monarch as opposed to a legislature. He believes a monarch would care for the people like his own and the legislature would simply sell the people out for self-aggrandizement. History has shown that tyranny is capable by any means of government though, especially by monarchy. He seems a bit dichotomous in his beliefs. On one hand, he believes that man can not be left too much liberty because man is always trying to supplant his neighbor for his own gain. On the other hand, his Christian-Commonwealth would essentially require that every man be a Christian and even the monarch be a Christian. Yet, if everyone lived by Christian ideals, namely the Golden Rule, then there would be no need for government or monarchs at all, hence full liberty which he finds to be dangerous.I was disappointed that two major issues of Leviathan were not discussed. First, sure the initial generation may voluntarily contract their rights to a monarch, but what about their children? Their children would now live under the authority of an individual with whom they never consented. Secondly, what about non-Christians? The monarch is a Christian. He would be the leader over both the State and the Church. In fact, according to Hobbes the State is the Church. What would be expected of or provided to non-Christians in a Christian State?I've definitely read worst than Hobbes. I've definitely read better than Hobbes. I give him proper respect for his writing style. It was incredibly unique and entertaining. As an ex-Catholic, I thoroughly enjoyed his connecting the Roman Catholic Church to the Heathen cults of the former empire. (My apologies to any Catholics reading this, I'm not trying to be incendiary, but honest). I did feel there was much lacking in respect to Leviathan, my whole purpose for reading. If you're looking for arguments against the Catholic Church (which could be used even today) then this would be a great read. If you're looking for a philosopher's vision of utopia and the machinations of government, this will probably bore you to tears."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"this book came quickly to my place and the book was great quality as well"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"First a word about the edition that I read. It was the Oxford World's Classics paperback. It claims to have modernized the spelling. I don't know about you, but as far as I am concerned doth, hath, belongeth is not modern. It wouldn't have been very hard for them to change it to does, has and belongs. Many people complain about the way it was written, making it hard to read. I found that if you read the difficult parts aloud, as if you were giving a lecture, they are easier to understand the first time through. Definitely not for speed-readers.Hobbes was a remarkable man. He published Leviathan when he was in his early 60's. For someone of his age he was very much in tune with the science of his day. One can only speculate that if he were to have been born 400 years later, with modern science at hand, he would have been considered the greatest philosopher of all time.The first part of his book, \\"Of Man\\" goes about providing definitions of what must be virtually all of humankinds various behaviours and emotions. He also goes on to define what is basic human nature. It is here, without the benefit of modern science, where his philosophy, indeed the cornerstone of his philosophy, gets off on the wrong foot. Thanks to modern archaeology we know that humans are not solitary creatures by nature, but social animals.In the second part of his book \\"Of Commonwealth\\" he spells out why we form commonwealths, and how a commonwealth should run. Again he is very thorough in looking at all aspects of a government and what it needs to do. He defines the power of the sovereign, the making of laws, the consequences of breaking these laws, and where the sovereign gets authority to carry out the consequences. I felt that he gave the sovereign far too much power, and he is there, it would seem, for life. The people only make covenants between themselves that this person or peoples are to be sovereign. Once a sovereign is declared, there is no covenant, or constitution, between the people and the sovereign; the sovereign is given Carte Blanche powers. One must remember that this book was written while Hobbes was in \\"exile\\" in Paris during the English civil war and the subsequent government of Cromwell. And while he is careful to call the sovereign \\"a person or assembly of people\\" it is quite obvious that he prefers the singular.The third part of the book \\"Of a Christian Commonwealth\\" was for a large part just skimmed over by me. Some people suggest that Hobbes, because of some of the things he says in the first half of the book, was really an atheist. They say that he wrote this to fool the church to thinking otherwise of him. After skimming through this part I feel that Hobbes was more likely a reformer, someone who definitely believed in God but didn't agree with the way the church and the Pope were behaving back then. I myself am an atheist and cannot imagine writing so copiously on a subject that I do not believe in, never mind doing all of the Biblical research that Hobbes must have.The fourth part, and the conclusion really don't have much to say. He is busy blasting the Pope, the Catholic Church and Aristotle.All in all some good philosophical points. His definitions of free will and spirit I think should be more widely taught. The fact that this edition could have been modernized a bit more, as well as the last half of the book being pretty useless today, leads me to give it three stars."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"OK, first off, skip the ENTIRE BEGINNING SECTION of this book - it is perfectly pointless today. In it, Hobbes is basically trying to do away with the concept of an immortal soul, thereby creating an atheistic society that cares nothing for religious matters. Hobbes is NOT known for his Philosophy of Mind.What everyone remembers about Leviathan is Hobbes' terse, cynical, and on-the-money observation that life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" Of course, what he means by this is life in the State of Nature. In order to try to make life a little better, man comes together to form societies.So far, so good. What most people take exception to is the kind of Social Contract that Hobbes endorses. Hobbes says that a society should come together to form a Social Contract in which everyone is OBEY THE SOVEREIGN UNCONDITIONALLY NO MATTER WHAT. Here's the kicker, the sovereign or king himself exists OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND IS NOT BOUND BY IT. In other words, the sovereign can do whatever he likes and the people must obey his commands no matter how cruel or ridiculous.Now, Hobbes was really trying to be more reasonable than he sounds. He lived at a time when England had spent years torn apart by constant war. He was also a self-professed coward: \\"Fear and I were born twins.\\" Basically, what he wanted was an end to war at all costs. For him, that meant obeying a STRONG RULER - in his case, Oliver Cromwell. The second section is addressed to the people trying to make them understand why this is in their best interests.The last section is addressed to the sovereign himself. Yes, he says, you can be a tyrant and do anything you want, BUT that will only cause you more trouble than it's worth. I have some advice for you to follow. Hobbes then goes on to RECOMMEND ways in which the sovereign could be a good ruler.In the end, Hobbes thought he was being an eminently practical man. To him, the \\"natural rights theorists\\" would just be talking nonsense."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"This book of Thomas Hobbes is surely a groundbreaking innovation in philosophy, especially political philosophy. It presents a comprehensive worldview based on mechanistic principles, and constructs a coherent theory on governance. Though I do not agree with his conclusion, the premises and arguments he uses is very useful and can give us tools and guidance for our own philosophical and political discourse. Only thing that prevents me from giving the book a higher rating is that Hobbes' language is extremely dry and boring, something characteristic of British philosophy. I found the same problem in reading John Locke and John Stuart Mill (who were both liberals and opposed to the ideas of Hobbes), the two philosophers of similar era to whom I have much admiration. It is hard to imagine that in a country that produced Shakespeare and Dickens must use such dreary language in philosophizing. My political science professor lectured that Hobbes' ideas were strongly influenced by Machiavelli, which I somewhat would agree. However, even Machiavelli was able to use more reader-friendly language."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"good read for anyone who likes the odd stuff in the world i like weird things and this is good read about this things i read a book that had this in it and decieced to but one myself to read more i like it"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"It was very fast and FREE, the book was send automatically to my kindle!

If you like thick political philosophy, you may enjoy this though. Unlike most political works, you should not feel compelled to agree with everything Hobbes states, as it is quite a difficult sell. But he is very enjoyable, unless of coarse you are an eternal optimist or true-blue believer in democracy.Although vilified by most for his extreme view of an all powerful head of state governing over the cruel and devilish populace, Hobbes creates a senerio that I think most would agree with in some way or form. People, left to their own devices, will inherently murder and steal from each other to the point that civilized life becomes unbearable. It's quite a world picture that Hobbes presents, and quite fascinating as well. The idea I believe Hobbes asks each person to explore is fundamental--what is the true nature of the individual? His answer in short is chilling--the individual is not to be trusted! While we can ask that education and high moral fiber dictate the peoples actions, do we really want to rely on the goodness of our neighbors, or do we want to keep a steady eye on them while holding fast to our sword?While I find it hard to believe any person would call themselves a die-hard Hobbesian, I think most people will find themselves answering in agreement to much that he has to say. After all, even many of the founding fathers feared the impulses of the masses and sought refuge in a powerful central government to keep the monsters at bay. Here's a tip: keep short notes while you read. Don't get caught up in all the details, and you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Three essential hallmarks of the Hobbesian system are important: the war of each against all, the role of human rationality in ending this; the use of knowledge/science as a basis for societal engineering. His view of the state of nature--that time before government and the state existed--is unsurprising when one understands that he was born in the year of the erstwhile invasion by the Spanish Armada (1588) and lived through civil turmoil and revolution in England throughout his life.Hobbes begins with a view of human life that would be inconceivable to the Greeks--life in a state of nature, the time before government, laws, and the state existed. In this state, humans are equal. In terms of physical prowess, of course, some are stronger than others. However, the weakest, through guile, can still kill the strongest. In that sense, there is equality. Without the power of government to keep people in check, though, we find quarrels routinely breaking out. The motives are threefold: self-gain, safety, and reputation (or glory). The result is horrible, and here follows perhaps the single most well known statement penned by Hobbes: \\"Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in a condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. . . .In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"However, the fear and terror of the state of nature can be escaped. Humans are, after all, according to Hobbes, capable of reason. Individual reason leads people to realize that they must do something to escape \\". . .Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them.\\" Furthermore, human reason allows individuals to understand laws of nature. This is defined by Hobbes as \\". . .a Precept, or general Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same.\\" To preserve life, and the fruits of industry that might be gained by peace, human reason lets people realize that only by giving up some of their freedoms, liberties, rights in order to establish a system that will end perpetual war of each against all. The mechanism for this is the \\"social contract,\\" by which people in the state of nature covenant with one another to form a powerful government, so powerful that it can suppress individuals' efforts to seek self-advantage as under the state of nature. A \\"Leviathan\\" is needed.However, if the state ceases to protect people's lives, the contract can be voided; revolution is an acceptable option for the citizenry then. However, the price is terrible, for with the dissolution of the state, people are plunged back into the nightmare of the state of nature. They would have to re-enact a contract to escape the ravages of the perpetual war.Key points in Hobbes: the focus is on the individual rather than society, hence this is an individualistic system; human reason is considered to be central to attaining peace and harmony; humans can perceive the essence of natural laws through the powers of their reason; by contracting with one another, the people can control their destinies and produce an environment which they find more commodious for living fruitfully. An important early work in the development of Modern thinking and liberal political thought. A must read work for those interested in Western political philosophy."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was born in England, a country that endured great political turmoil during his life. Having lived through that, Hobbes' main aim was to inquire into the basis of order. The question he asked himself was \\"What kind of political authority will prevent the return of chaos?\\". And the answer to that question is in this book, \\"Leviathan\\" (1651).The Levianthan is the personification of total power, an authority without limits, created by men who realise that absolute power given to a powerfull ruler (or to an assembly) is their only way out of the dangers of the state of nature. The name that the author chose for his monarch is quite telling: the Leviathan is a sea monster that appears in the Bible and symbolizes power. This kind of monarch seems like an extreme solution for the problem of anarchy, but it is the only one that Hobbes found. Without the Leviathan, life is 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.'Of course, this book includes many more things than those I have already mentioned. For instance, it explains quite well Hobbes opinion regarding human nature (man is naturally a wolf to men), the state of nature (perpetual war of all against all), the origin of political institutions and the relationship between reason and force (pacts without swords are merely words), among other things.On the whole, I think this book is a classic of Political Philosophy, and I recommend it as such. Despite that, I think a word of caution is in order, so you will be prepared for what you will find when you tackle \\"Leviathan\\". Truth to be told, sometimes Hobbes' prose is too dry, and in some chapters you will need to plod through some rather arid pages. Moreover, this book isn't written in modern English, what makes it more difficult to understand. Those are the reasons why I give this book four stars instead of five...Notwithstanding that, I believe that \\"Leviathan\\" is well-worth the effort of reading it, simply because it has some interesting concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them. The only way to discuss in a level play field with someone who has totally different ideas is to understand his arguments thoroughly, even if his position seems completely strange to you. I invite you to do that with Hobbes, reading \\"Leviathan\\".Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' Leviathan is a great work of literature and political philosophy, but unless you need it in its original, seventeenth century dialect, the edition published by Great Books in Philosophy series by Prometheus Books is not recommended.

Five stars for Hobbes, but one star for this edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"It seems a little dishonest to me for Norton not to reveal on the cover of this book that it is an abridged version. In fact, the only way to know that is to read the footnote in the Table of Contents, or the preface.It happens that, in my view, the Leviathan can use the abridging, and it is very possibly that you think so too. But readers should be told that before they buy. So I am telling you.I'm a bit disappointed with the secondary materials, too, but not quite disappointed enough to grouse about it too much. Still, it seems like the editors could have made up for all those lost pages in the main text to get more ambitious in the secondary materials.I still give it four stars because I like the abridged version."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"For those who dislike the archaic spelling in Hobbes, this edition with modernized text and spelling is the one for them. The opening sentence suffices to show the difference. The following is the original text:\\"Concerning the Thoughts of man, I will consider them first Singly, and afterwards in Trayne, or dependence upon one another.\\" (With Singly and Trayne in italics)The modernized text in this edition is:\\"Concerning the thoughts of man, I will consider them first singly, and afterwards in train, or dependence upon one another.\\" (No italics)There is a decent introduction by Gaskin, a bibliography, an index and explanatory notes, and this edition is very competitively priced.As a student at Oxford I chose an optional paper \\"Political theory from Hobbes\\". It was \\"from Hobbes\\" because modern political philosophy begins with him. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not consider the origins of government. In Hobbes we find concepts that became standard in political thought: human nature, state of nature, social contract, absolute and limited government, civil disobedience, censorship, etc.Hobbes supposes that organized society is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\" with both a \\"right of nature\\" and \\"laws of nature\\", but Hobbes uses the terms in an idiosyncratic way. The \\"right of nature\\" is \\"the liberty each man has, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own life\\" and doing anything that is necessary to achieve this. In addition there are a number of \\"laws of nature\\". The first dictates that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and the second is that each person should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These (and other laws that follow from them) are found by reason and are utilitarian rather than prudential. Morality does not enter into it. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing the same is the best means of self-preservation, even though this is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Men have the power of reason that suggests possible advantages of co-operation but this is outweighed by instinct. Men are competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability, so no one person or group can impose his will on others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Hence men are driven to create government via a pact in which all give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Very importantly, Hobbes assigns absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government is unworkable, for men are too quarrelsome and selfish and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Hobbes was influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War in which he lived. Among the ten rights Hobbes awards the sovereign the sixth is the power of censorship of opinions he deems harmful to the state. Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it is a source of conflict. As for anybody seeking to preach a new religion, he should be treated as a criminal. Hobbes was not a religious man but he could not avoid discussing the role of religion in the age in which he lived.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men consent to an absolute ruler in order to better secure self-preservation. If a situation arises where the sovereign fails to achieve that then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes observes that a criminal going to his execution retains his natural right to resist, but he is not saying it is a \\"moral\\" right, and in fact the sovereign is right to execute him. On conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's natural right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of the state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand the sacrifice of my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government. Those who prefer the original to this modernized text have many choices, including the Macpherson edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes's Leviathan is of course a major and essential work of modern Western political philosophy. But it comes in many different editions, which have different strengths and weaknesses (and which omit or include the full text and other relevant works).It is not at all helpful that Amazon lumps the reviews of these different editions together. From this amalgam, you cannot determine which is the best edition for you. I agree with Greg Taylor that the best unabridged paperback editions are published by Cambridge U Press and Hackett. For me, Norton Critical editions contains a good abridged text with excellent supplementary readings. For rich scholars, Oxford U Press has just published the definitive critical edition, edited by Noel Malcolm. There are many other editions -- examine them carefully. (Among other things, some modernize spelling, others don't.)"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' thesis that the natural state of man is chaos and war is the primary justification he provides for an all encompassing authority to be placed unalterably in the hands of the Sovereign, or Leviathan. What he neglects to address is the absolutely corrupting influence such power has on the all too human Kings, Queens, and legislative bodies which hold such power over their fellow creatures.There is a saying that if men were were angels we would not need government, or if that angels administered man's government then we would not need to worry as to constraining them. But neither of these delusions can be ever be achieved by fallible man, no matter how much certain individuals may otherwise hope. You cannot legislate morality and you cannot make men charitable by forcing them to give. And much to the annoyance of Plato, no amount of education or cultural refinement can immunize man to the ever present threats of avarice, arrogance, and blind ambition. There must be checks on this power if men are to retain their hard-fought liberty and if the ultimate power of the government is to maintain its rightful abode with the People.As we in America have learned, there is a concept of government much more attuned to the particulars of human nature than the false bravado of Leviathan. It is limited government, where every individual choose for himself what he thinks is best, to the degree that he does not infringe on the natural rights of his fellows. Freedom of oppression from the government is our nation's calling card, and it has empowered and enriched man to a degree never before imagined. It seems that man's natural state, when guaranteed certain inalienable rights, was far flung indeed from an interminable warfare on his neighbors.So, Hobbes had a lot to learn but perhaps not the opportunity to do so. However, I did enjoy and learn much from him in his thorough and unbiased defense of his monarchical position using the Scriptures. He has an immense mastery of them, and cuts through some of the more confusing points of contention between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. He even goes so far as to address the varying degrees of heaven, the existence (or not) of an everlasting Hell, and Baptism for the Dead. It provided me with an excellent base from which to further understand the faith of the early American colonists and the churches they established in the lead-up to the American Revolution.Still, this is one of the more difficult books on this subject I've yet to slog through and so be warned that you may want to start with some lighter tomes on this subject."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes presents his version of science, politics, and modern state.

However, as with other books such as Plato's Republic, we are ultimately dealing with undercrediting human beings for their complexity. It seems that Hobbes is only able to see humans capable of being evil, brutish, and short, while not considering many, many, many other qualities a human can take on. I cannot blame Hobbes for being appaled at the sight of the war he fought, but this is only one face of human kind- a violent expression of the will to power if you will. Besides, if humans are so corrupt what guarantees that the people under the supreme ruler will not ultimately destroy the ruler with their brutishness? Above all, if all men are evil brutish and short how is it ever possible to find a ruler that may take over the people?I cannot however discredit Hobbes for his influence on the more correct philosphers, such as Nietzsche (remember the Ubermensch?) and fortification against anarchists. We could have, however, done with out his obvious influence on nihilism, though it is not his fault forbeing misread.A note on the edition: as always I was satisfied with the quality of Penguin Classics in introducing the text and the annotations.

The reader, however, must update Hobbes' basic argument by including non-state actors, such as transnational religious groups, drug gangs, etc."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"First off, this is a review of Richard Tuck's Cambridge Text edition of Hobbes' Leviathan. This is one of several excellent editions of this powerful and disturbing work. I can also recommend the Hackett edition.Hobbes is on the short list of philosophers that every person should try to read. This is so for several reasons. He is a superb and witty writer who is capable of expressing his thought in unforgettable phrases and with ruthless logic and consistency. The result is a book that had enormous influence on political thought, on epistemology, on diplomatic thinking and on legal theory. You can trace his influence on Grotius, on Locke, on legal positivism and analytical philosophy among others.And the best part is that in spite of all that cultural impact to read him closely and with attention to his moment in our history is to still feel some of the shock of his effect on his contemporaries.Over his lifetime, Hobbes observed Europe and his own England tear themselves apart. This was the Europe suffering from the effects of The Thirty Years War and England plummeting into revolution and regicide.Hobbes, who started out a great classicist, looked around at his contemporaries and took solace in Thucydides. He developed a theory of a humanity that required strict control to overcome its inherit individualistic rapacity. Hobbes, who was a excellent student of the sciences, read Descartes and Galileo's physics and developed a materialist philosophy that based everything on matter and motion. Even God was material. If He wasn't then He wasn't at all. Hobbes was an excellent mathematician who used geometry and Galileo's work to develop his own methodology for philosophy. Hobbes had seen what religious and political faction could do and developed a theory of absolute sovereignty that gave that sovereign (whether king or Parliament) full control of the public expression of religious observance, of political thought and of justice. He put this all together in a coherent and consistent theory of the state- one of the first. Along the way, Hobbes attempted to purge the language of the obfuscations of Aristotle, the Schoolmen and of all talk of spirits and spiritualism.All that in just the first half. The second half of the book is basically submitting the Bible to a rational pruning and cutting in such a way that he can claim that Scripture backs up the reasoning he used to justify his political philosophy. It can be read as one of the opening salvos of Deism, of a subversive and surreptitious atheism or of just good clean fun for you rational humanists out there. I see you out there.Leviathan is a heady and challenging book, at once frustrating and fascinating. It is far too grounded in a faulty physics (Descartes) yet is worth the read just for the way he defines terms and teases out the implications of those definitions. There are some people who we read (like Plato, Nietzsche, the Buddha or Machiavelli) just to get them inside your head. I have found that there are times in my personal life that I needed help from the Buddha or the Stoa or even Machiavelli. Sometimes in my corporate life, I have needed help from Nietzsche (that usually didn't go very well) or Hobbes or the Nichomachean Ethics. Life is tricky that way.The Cambridge edition comes with an excellent introduction, a glossary for most of the historical and Biblical characters who are mentioned and a good bibliography. But like I said earlier, there are many good editions of Leviathan. Read, read, read, my friends."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan was the first modern political theorem written in the English language. Poetry, essays, plays and a few academic analyses on Politics existed before that, but it was Hobbes who fathered modern political thought in all its rational and logical stipulation. It was Hobbes who questioned and fought the traditional notions of political understanding; nobody prior to Hobbes had ever cross-examined the foundations of a Monarchic structure within society and the genesis of government. In the introduction itself, Hobbes asserts his assumption that an organized state of life is a choice, just as chaos is a choice as well. He makes it clear in the start that nature predisposes everyone with certain rights and a prerequisite set of laws. Every man has a right to defend his life with all his ability and the law that nature imposes on every being is to live a life of peace and to treat others as one would like to be treated. He states that for self-preservation, man must bind himself in contract with other men to give up our birthrights to be protected by a collectively elected sovereign power. This sovereign power must have unconditional authority in every single aspect of life; there is no entity that boasts more strength or questions the elected sovereign power; everything else besides the sovereign is reigned by the sovereign.According to Hobbes, the nature of man is motivated by his passions, and there is no greater and intense passion than fear. Fear triumphs over all other emotions and man's primal fear is of losing his life by force, which can even make him take irrational decisions. It is this logical prognosis of his that made him believe that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong, unless man follows the law of nature; to live in peace and preserve his life in unison with his fellow citizens. His cynicism for human nature is established when he states that the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\\". He says the only way to overcome the innate fear of death and the knowledge of the nature of human nature is to bind oneself in contract with the State so that everyone can be protected and life can go on without the pre-dominant instinctual fears that corrupt men into malice. Hobbes' approach to all his findings is very mechanical and stems from deductive reasoning. And as no arguments and understanding prior to him existed in the field of his discourse, a majority of his conclusions are axiomatic in definition. Because he wants his audience to think with the same rationality that he commands, Hobbes explains in microscopic detail the machinations of human civilization, beginning with an acute explanation of Man and his senses. He geometrically divides and disassembles our understanding of ourselves and then chauffeurs us to a perspective change that is required to comprehend all Hobbesian deduction.While the twenty first century's modern man might question Hobbes' reasoning behind granting all power to the \\"State\\", one must have an understanding of the epistemology of the Hobbesian thought that stemmed from an elongated suffering due to prolonged war, which arose due to the weakness in the Government that commanded during his youth. Thus, to evade the chaos of civil disagreement, Hobbes yields his logic and grants all existing power and importance to one sole entity. He grants power to the sovereign to literally do anything without any repercussions and also grants it an authority higher than that of God. All this is done because the sovereign is the selected representative of the whole population of his state, making this sole source of power also a theoretical manifestation of the state. This concept of the all-powerful state, an entity that embodies the constituency of all its citizens, officials and the sovereign power collectively is called the Leviathan; A form of a living and breathing beast that nothing in this world can oppose. Hobbes states that the existence of such a state is imperative to subdue all its' subjects in obedience, because fear is the only emotion a human being will submit to unconditionally, especially whence it is from a behemoth to the likes of a Leviathan.Hobbes' diction and grammatology is an arduous passage to cross, but the ideas and theories he is postulating required him to twist his words in his times' verbatim. One must always acknowledge the colloquial dialect of the English language Hobbes' time nurtured him with. He creates layers of ideas upon layers of laws that are meant to take the reader to precise conclusions. The purpose of his loquacity is to reach at one sole conclusion only, and that is what makes Leviathan a timeless study of logic.It is quiet evident that even after five centuries of radical polarization in the perception of government and politics, Leviathan still stands like the name of the entity it bears. It was this book that inspired almost all political theoreticians for many centuries to come. Students and admirers of both liberal and conservative political thought will benefit from reading Leviathan."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Leviathan is, of course, a classic so I won't waste words on its merits. The issue is this edition. This version retains the original spelling. If you are Ok with this then it would probably be OK for you. If not, not. I'd prefer a more scholarly edition with an introduction decent footnotes as, I suspect, would the average reader."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that I've only read Books I-II of Leviathan (about half), but as a close friend recently told me, \\"That may be a new record.\\" Although the title refers to the ideal leader of state, it could easily be attributed to the book itself; it's a truly exhaustive, and exhausting, development of Hobbes' theory of political government, and it took me more than 2 months to sort through the first 400-odd pages.Besides its girth, the first thing that I would say usually dissuades readers from Hobbes' masterwork is the fact that many of its theories on government have been discarded over the last 300 years. He was not a fan of representative democracy - he held a largely pessimistic view on collective human nature - and viewed absolute rule under one centralized authority as the only form of government capable of controlling large groups of people with conflicting goals and opinions.That said, what kept me reading the first two books was how rigorously and completely he develops his theories of government from very basic anatomic principles and universal truths. It goes something like this:In Book I, entitled \\"Of Man,\\" Hobbes uses the scientific principles of his time to show how the human body operates in the world, gaining knowledge and competing with other human bodies for supremacy; this is, in the parlance of Locke, Rousseau, Hume and other 16th and 17th Century philosophers, the State of Nature, which in Hobbes words makes every human life \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"(I suspect that Hobbes, while using biblical references and terminology, was a closet atheist, as his view of human nature and survival was Darwinist well before Darwin. I've found at least one religious zealot in my book inventory who agrees with me, a missionary named Paul Hutchinson who wrote a book called \\"The New Leviathan\\" directly after WWII comparing the communist governments of Russia and China the ideal all-powerful state power Hobbes set forth in Leviathan. Of course, Hutchinson doesn't mind playing both sides of the coin, also referring to the fascist regimes of Mussolini and Hitler in Hobbesian terms in one chapter entitled \\"The Worship of the \`Mortal God'.\\")It's interesting and ironic that Hobbes in Book I derides educators and philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and St. Thomas of Aquinas for your use of metaphors, which are to his empirical understanding not absolute and thus not reliable (\\"For words are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles\\" - Chapter 4), since Book II of Leviathan, \\"Of Commonwealth,\\" relies entirely upon the metaphor of government functioning as a human body. To his mind, every functional nation of the world is in the state of nature (in other words, the state of war) with every other nation. This, to his mind, is why nations are formed - [CUT] to protect the citizens, i.e., the parts of the body, from harm by other nations, i.e., political bodies.The only way Hobbes saw to do this - and this is where Hobbes has aged worst - was through enforced dictatorial rule, as the only way to keep people from breaking civil and natural laws was through fear of retribution (to be fair, Hobbes wrote Leviathan while in exile during one of England's bloodiest civil wars, so his primary political motive was ending internal conflict). I think the reason this opinion is universally decried is that most ideologies from either end of the political spectrum have something not to like - free-market advocates see the competition Hobbes wanted to eliminate as the ideal ruling power; his centralized oligarchical rule is exactly what liberal constitutionalists created social contracts against; religious fundamentalists are continually up in arms when the government conflicts with their own tenets.Jane Jacobs in the introduction to The Death and Life of Great American Cities rails against urban planners of the time she wrote it (it was first published in 1961) as \\"earnest and learned men, dealing with complex phenomena they do not understand at all and trying to make do with a pseudoscience.\\" I probably wouldn't use such strong language about Hobbes' political philosophy, but the principle is similar - Hobbes may have gotten it all wrong, but he got it wrong better than most of us have gotten it right."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"The Leviathan is one of the most important books ever written on political and solcial philosophy and it explains what the first duty of government is: to maintain stability and avoid anarchy.The USA is the world's largest democracy. Yet, a natural disaster in New Orleans is sufficient to create anarchy. Reading Hobbes one can very clearly and simply understand that government is the only guarantee to avoid this anarchy. This is why one of the world's most stable country, Switzerland, has such a large public administration. As you can see, the Leviathan can lead to many conclusions of what happens in today's world and help us understand it better.The Leviathan is a challenging read, which you can read on the surface, but also read in a substantial detail. Hobbes is an author that uses a very simple English (for his time), but says a lot more than he seems to say. Obviously, the English is not very accessible for everybody and can take some time to read fully. However, it is definately worth reading this book properly, as it will allow you to derive a lot of conclusions and help your understanding of current affairs as well as your studies of economic and social sciences.The introduction to this book is very good, although some of the conclusions drawn there could be argued. On the whole this is an excellent book, especially to all those interested in the matter."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"This huge work is the foundation of classical liberalism; it is the basis for Locke, for Smith, and all economic neo-liberalists all the way up to the current period. Written during the English Reformation, Hobbes was confronted with the problem of absolute individualism; he begins this work of political theory with a demolishment of objective truth swift enough to impress any post-modernist. He then proceeds to demonstrate the logical conclusion of man in a state of nature, and compels the modern world to enter into his social contract, or Leviathan out of necessity and fear. It is tempting to write off Hobbes as a cynic, but who can deny that much of what motivates individuals in the modern world is simply a fear to maintain survival and acceptance. It is the driving force of modern societies in terms of economic competition, and inter-national conflicts. Hobbes was a thinker of true depth and insight, though his ideas are so commonly ingrained in modern society that it is difficult to see why they were revolutionary when they were composed."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Being a free Kindle edition there is no introduction and no notes - but you do get the full text. The only difference from the original is that there are fewer capitals and italics. Hobbes used them for emphasis very much more than a modern writer would, and their pruning in this edition makes the text easier to read.Modern political philosophy begins with Hobbes. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not think much about the origins of government. Hobbes provides reasons as to how and why men come together to form government. He starts with the assumption that the organized state is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\", where there is both a \\"right\\" of nature and \\"laws\\" of nature. Hobbes uses these terms in a very individual way. The \\"right\\" of nature is \\"the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own Life\\". The \\"laws\\" of nature dictate that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These \\"laws\\" are found by reason, and are utilitarian rather than moral. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing likewise is the best means of self-preservation, even though actually doing it is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Reason suggests advantages stem from co-operation, but unless men are constrained by an external authority this is outweighed by instinct. Men are fundamentally competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability so no one person can impose his will on others, and the most one can hope for is to protect oneself from others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Men are therefore driven to create government via a pact with others to give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Hobbes' view of human nature is such that he allocates absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government, he believed, is unworkable for men are too prone to division and selfishness, and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War, Hobbes grants the sovereign the power of censorship, including the ability to prevent discussion of religion because such discussion leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal.Had Hobbes been writing a century later then religion would almost certainly have played no part in his writings. He himself was not a religious man. His concern with religion stemmed from its role in the conflict leading to the English Civil War, a period during which he lived.Is there an ultimate right of rebellion against the absolute ruler? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural right to self-preservation to a sovereign in order to to better achieve it. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that safety then society is dissolved. Can any action by the sovereign be challenged? Yes, if a man is conscripted into military service (an obvious threat to life) in circumstances where the survival of the state is not threatened. If the survival of the state is threatened then so are the lives of its citizens, and in these circumstances the sovereign can impose conscription. Hobbes adds that even in this case a citizen should have the right to replace himself with a volunteer if one is available.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"What you first need to know is that the word \\"Authoritative\\" used in this edition refers to the fact that it utilizes several different manuscript versions to capture what Hobbes meant to convey. However, what is not mentioned is that this is an abridged version of the text. Much of parts III & IV are omitted. Which is a bit disappointing.I gave this 5 stars because Hobbes himself deserves 5 stars for his provocative ideas. If you're familiar & comfortable with Shakespeare's language, you won't be put off by the cavalier spelling & grammar rules of Hobbes' era. This is not to say that Hobbes writes in blank verse (haha), but that the language is a bit arcane & takes some acclimatization.Footnotes were, for the most part good - in the body of the text, foreign phrases were translated for those woefully ignorant (like me) of Latin & ancient Greek. However, in the post-ceding criticisms, this very positive practice was discontinued. As in, whole footnotes in Latin & German were not translated. So, get your browsers set to Babelfish, baby.The accompanying criticisms are a mixed bag - some worth reading, some, not so much. They help elucidate some points - which is great for a casual reader like myself. Others just serve to annoy.Eitherway, if you're looking for a definitive edition of the Leviathan, don't look here because you will miss about 1/3 of the actual text which Hobbes wrote down. If you want to skip the parts about theology & much of that which was tied into the Christian Commonwealth, then this is your edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"I finished reading Leviathan a couple months ago, but cringed every time I thought about writing a review. The book is large at over 700 pages and covers so much ground, a review would have to be a book in itself to do it justice. Due to Leviathan's philosophical content and somewhat antiquated language, it's very slow going. Each page needs time to digest.So I'm not going to bother writing a real review. I will just say that Leviathan is a 5-star classic and worth your time, if you can deal with reading political philosophy. Hobbes divides the work into four major sections:Of Man, in which he discusses human nature and why civilized people prefer peace to war. Here Hobbes establishes the primary reason that people form a government to rule over them: to safeguard them from enemies, both external and internal.Of Common-wealth, in which Hobbes first talks about the several forms of government and the pros and cons of each. He then explains the rights that a government has over its people; according to Hobbes, the government can do pretty much anything it wants to. Finally he goes into the things that tend to weaken or dissolve a government.Of a Christian Common-wealth, the longest section, in which Hobbes accepts the Bible as the word of God and quotes from it numerous time to bolster his position in support of a powerful government.Of the Kingdome of Darknesse, the shortest and strangest section, in which Hobbes veers away from the topic of government and instead focuses on religious practices and beliefs of the day that he deems improper and inconsistent with the Bible.It took me months to read this, but I came away with great respect for Hobbes and a better understanding of politics. I can't say that I agree with everything I read, but I think the majority of his arguments are sound and convincing.Five stars, no doubt in my mind. But it's a dive into the deep end, so you'll probably only finish it if you really appreciate and enjoy philosophical discussion!"},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' sole claim to fame these days is the out-of-context quotation from him that life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; The full quotation from chapter 13, section 9 which inveighs against the state of war, in concluding the statement on man's condition in such a state, is &quot;and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&quot;-Beats me why &quot;solitary&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; are left out of the popular quotation-The point is, this is the condition Hobbes wanted to AVOID, not to justify! He had just lived through the bloodfest known as the English Civil War in which many of his friends were horribly slaughtered because of their religious beliefs. His whole point in writing this book was to advance arguments that one should not go to war over differences in religion. His controversial alternative is absolute obedience to the state and secular authorities. This alternative combined with the quote, noted above, so maddeningly and frequently taken out of context, have given Hobbes and his work the undeserved reputation as, well, curmudgeonly. One might ask what sort of book you might write if you had just witnessed the horrific slaughter and loss of esteemed friends that Hobbes had. You would probably write a book urging peace at any price even if it meant undue subjugation to the state at times. This is exactly what Hobbes did.-Hobbes belongs to that majestic, good-natured and unflappable tradition of brilliant English heretical political and religious writers including, among others, David Hume (well, Scottish too) and Bertrand Russell who seemed merely humored by the ecclesiastics calling down hell-fire upon them and similar dire threats from men in power. Scholars are STILL trying to debunk the work of these prominent men, among others more obscure, with little success it must be said.- Yes, the prose can be rough-going at times. But if you want an argument against war, specifically war over religion. This is the masterpiece to set your nose to. Once you've finished, it's hard not to smile when you think of Hobbes and his essential decency amidst the turbulent times in which he lived."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Like most books, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan is divided into chapters. But it is also divided into four \\"Parts.\\" The Prometheus edition (not to be confused with the Penguin edition) includes only the first two parts, though they sell it as if it were the entire book instead of only the first half. Any other edition would be better than this.If you want a good edition, you could go with the Hackett edition, edited by Edwin Curley, modernized and with the important variants (translated into English, of course) from the Latin edition of the Leviathan published during Hobbes' lifetime. A good edition that is not modernized is the Cambridge edition edited by Richard Tuck. (Having an editor does NOT necessarily mean that the text has been reduced; they often serve to rid the text of previous publishing typographical errors.) Which of these you should get will depend upon two things: Whether you are interested in the variants from the Latin edition, and whether you are comfortable reading something written in the 1600's. For most people, probably the modernized Hackett edition would be best, as many people have difficulty with 17th century English. But if you want Hobbes' exact words, I recommend the Cambridge edition. Whenever buying classic texts, which edition you buy can be extremely important, as the dreadful Prometheus edition demonstrates."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Leviathan is one of the first books written after philosophy begun to detach itself from the Catholic inspired medieval thinking, also marking the beginning of the influence philosophy received from the scientific thinking, a point not suficiently y explored by Thomas Hobbes but which one we can get with the benefit of hindsight.Leviathan is an old Fenician word for a mythical crocodile, quoted in some verses of the biblical Book of Job, an taken by Thomas Hobbes as meaning the representation of a powerfull governor totally devoted to do his most to the benefit of the Commonwealth. In Hobbes mind the most efficient form of government was monarchy, but he takes a lot of time to analyse also Democracy and Aristocracy. One has to keep in mind that the time the book was written was one of internal revolt, a civil intestine strife in England, and the objective of Hobbes was to lay the foundations for human actions conducive to an equilibrium within the state, ending war.His book can be also be taken as one where many important aspects of Right and Laws are aprehended, from the perspective of a deeply religious anglican man, that tried his best to separate, in his words, the Kingdoms of men (where civil laws are imperative) from the Kingdom of God (Naturall Right). He does extensive analysis of God's Laws and its importance to the balance in the relationship between men.The edition is a very good one, with a good introduction and is a copy of the text as written in the 17th century, exhibiting an archaic English sometimes difficult to understand. Also, some quotations in Greek and in Latin are not translated, despite all the effort the author makes to turn them inteligible to the reader.The book could be understood as antipodal to Machiavellian's The Prince, because power is not taken here as something good in itself, but only as a means of carrying the security and hapinnes the kingdom subjects deserve."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"While I enjoyed the text itself very much, I cannot recommend this particular copy of it. I read parts of it for a class, and wanted to read more on my own, but I simply could not make it through 736 small pages of miniscule print without getting frustrated (as well as getting a headache). Further, the margins are practically nonexistent, making it a poor copy to buy for anyone who likes to take notes in the book. Additionally, the binding is quite weak.I would encourage any interested parties to continue pursuing the 'Leviathan,' as it is a very rich text indeed, but I would recommend finding a different copy."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"To understand Hobbes' LEVIATHAN, the reader must first focus on 'fear.' His contemporaries were terrified of chaos and anarchy and would move heaven and earth to preserve the continuity of the state. Nowhere does he mention the word 'fear' but his real, if underlying purpose becomes clear enough as the reader plows through his dense tract that has as its purported goal to explain the origin of political institutions and to define their powers and proper limits. Hobbes sets up this thesis by first insisting that all of men's ideas originate from sense impressions, which take their cue from the external universe infringing on these sense organs. This emphasis on sense impression led Hobbes next to consider how the external universe manages this neat trick. Motion, according to Hobbes, is the key. Motion naturally leads man, for good or ill, to impact on other men. This impacting may be beneficial, as in man agreeing to help one another respect their respective rights, or it may be harmful, as in man being in a state or war. It was this fear that humanity might start to question the wisdom of the ruling nobility that caused Hobbes to write the longest defense of the royal right of kings ever written. Hobbes cleverly compared man to a wind-up clock: 'That great Leviathan is but an artificial man with an artificial soul.' As the reader follows this geometric logic, he is pressured to accept Hobbes' true premise: that it is better for the common man to put up with the occasional despot than to risk what he terms the horror of 'that condition which is called Warre, and such a warre as is of every man, against every man.'Even if that regime becomes so thuggish that its citizens wish to break it, Hobbes says 'No way.' If these citizens do break this covenant, then Hobbes warns that their lives will be 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.' Clearly Hobbes was a man of his times, one who was a paid shill of the crowned heads of Europe. Such a man today we would label as a fearful toady who desperately needs to maintain his own precarious hold on power. So why is LEVIATHAN still read today? Perhaps Hobbes points out the road that humanity might have once chosen to travel. We, like Robert Frost, have thankfully chosen the other less travelled by."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"Tommy Hobbes was Francis Bacon's favorite secretary, and it shows in the math-like precision with which he attempts to build a model of human political interaction -- one that justifies the need for a strong state to hold human &quot;appetites&quot; in check. Hobbes' argument reads like a geometrical proof, which goes something like:We take it as a given that people, like Galilean celestial bodies, are in perpetual motion, moved by appetites for power. The power of a person is his or her present means to obtain some future good. Every person's power resists and hinders the effects of other people's power. Thus, if all people are created equal in a hypothetical state of nature, then:1. From equality proceeds mutual fear.2. From mutual fear proceeds warfare.3. In such warfare, nothing is unjust.4. But reason suggests a better way to self-preservation (to peace): the right and laws of nature.5. The right of nature is the liberty we have to use our power for self-preservation.6. The 1st law of nature is that we ought to strive for peace, but when we cannot obtain it then it's war.7. The 2nd law of nature is that in the interests of peace we will lay down our natural right to give us as much liberty as we would allow others to have against us (the golden rule).8. This mutual laying down of our natural right is a social contract.9. There must be a coercive power (the commonwealth) to enforce this contract.10. The commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign who embodies the will of the people and is granted certain inalienable rights to enforce the social contract.In short, those who fear authority (anarchists, libertarians, etc.) will revile Hobbes, because of power's potential for abuse, but Hobbes would argue that a true Leviathan could never abuse its subjects because it is actually made up of those same subjects (in other words, a roundabout defense of liberal democracy)."},{"Title":"Leviathan","review":"While most readers pay a great deal of attention to Hobbes' political theory in this work, they fail to realize that the early half contains some of the most ground breaking and revolutionizing treatment of philosophy ever written. In a philosophical atmosphere dominated by Cartesian metaphysics and epistemology, Hobbes' emphasis on the way we use language, rather than &quot;clear and distinct ideas&quot; is simply mind blowing. Hobbes, like Descartes, was interested in laying some &quot;extra-scientific&quot; foundation for the new sciences of Newton and Gallileo. Whereas Descartes seems to have found such a foundation in his relation to God, Hobbes saw it in language. In this sense, it anticipated &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language&quot; by 4 long centuries. Hobbes' fascinating account of what constitutes &quot;truth&quot; and answers to traditional philosophical problems that apply his theories on language are astounding. While Hobbes' political theory is wrought with the very ambiguities he sought to destroy in philosophical and scientific discourse (e.g. what concretely constitutes the &quot;leviathan&quot; and the &quot;soveriegn&quot;), the ties between language and political theory stayed unexamined for a number of decades, if not centuries. Hobbes' highly original and innovative thought are an inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"Spirit of the Border, The: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley","review":"Drawing upon ancestors notes, Zane Gray reconstructs the agony of America's initial transmontane western movement of the frontier away from the original colonies into the OHIO Valley where Indians and Whites contest for souls and Wetzel, and Indian hunter, pursues his cause in a most dramatic fashion. The book is a riveting account of true adventure the veiled backdrop of which is the continued occupation of the teritory occupied by British and Americans. An excellent introduction to further study of the the then misunderstood goal of Manifest Destiny."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This book is the story of a high-born middle-aged Pakistani Muslim woman who converted from Islam to Christianity in 1966. The story describes how she came to convert to Christianity and the consequences to herself and her extended Muslim family over the next six years.The book provided a fascinating look into what life was like for Christians in Pakistan in 1966 to 1972. Pakistan is an Islam nation, but apparently the culture was fairly moderate until a change occurred in the government in 1976. Still, at the time Bilquis Sheikh converted, Christianity was for the poor who wanted food and clothing from the missionaries, not for the rich.The book started with a series of startling supernatural things that happened to her that led her to start deeply studying the Koran and, later, the Bible. Then she took her grandson to a hospital, and a nun suggested she pray to God as her father. The idea was a shocking one, but she tried it...and got a response. She then asked God which holy book was the true one, and He responded by asking her which one referred to Him as father. After careful consideration of how converting to Christianity would affect her life and that of her extended family and after sneaking over to ask questions of two Christian missionaries, she becomes a Christian. When the news becomes public, her life was threatened and her own family shunned her. She also struggled with how to constantly stay in the presence of God.Overall, the book was a well-written, engrossing, and powerful story. The author was very open about her faults and struggles, both before and after her conversion. I'd very highly recommend it to all Christians.A Different Time, A Different Place Book Reviews[...]"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I just finished reading this book and highly recommend it.It is an inspiring true and personal testimony of a wealthy traditional Muslim woman who came to the faith through vivid dreams from God. As she journeys from Islam to Christianity, her salvation leads to her to a wonderfully intimate relationship with Christ. She is dedicated and obedient in all details of her life, big and small , and openly shares her struggles with temporal things, a sharp tongue, and pride and how she learns to overcome her flesh and walk in a true relationship with the Lord. It is void of the shallow Christianity that is so prevalent in our society today, and I found that very refreshing . It left me desiring a deeper level of intimacy with God as well as causing me to evaluate my own obedience and faith in Him . The presence of the Lord she experiences is rare, but so is the faith and trust that she has for Him.Her simplistic faith, untouched and tainted by modern Christianity and its rules and doctrine is a beautiful testament of how the Spirit will teach us all we need to know about Him. As He gives her dreams, leads her into the Scriptures and speaks to her she learns His word and how to obey Him. Her obedience, even as her life is threatened, is encouraging. I love a part in the book where she tells the Lord she doesn't have what it takes to be a martyr, so she asks Him to make her death quick and painless! I laugh because I have often prayed that myself.Being a Muslim living in the middle east, coming to the faith in Christ was worthy of death. She was ostracized by her family and threatened with her life, yet she held steadfast and unwavering to the Lord in spite of it.This book was originally written in 1978 but has been republished and includes an after word from two missionary friends who were close with her and were used to disciple Bilquis in her walk with the Lord. The author is now with the Lord, but has left behind a shining example of what a true relationship with Christ is for today.It is an easy read and one that would make a wonderful family read aloud. I will definitely be adding it to book our pile to read to my children.Stephaniewww.ahighandnoblecalling.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I am currently taking a course on Islam and the anstructor thought that this book would be an interesting read as to how women in that society were treated from their perspective. My wife and I read the book together in ONE DAY, she read it out loud as we drove around running arrands and then as we arrived home we finished that evening. Neither of us wanted to put the book down as it had us captured from page one.This book was obviously written by a well educated woman raised in the Muslim faith who started on the journey to Christianity through a carefully thought out spiritual process.I would call this book a Must Read for Christians of today as we have lost this simplistic view of our faith that this woman had and our willingness to defend it to the loss of everything.The book is yet in a very simplistic writing style that it reads much like one of Kipling's stories that the author quotes and obviously was raised on in Pakistan."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"A wonderful, encouraging and profoundly thought-provoking look at life as a woman in a Muslim culture who converts to Jesus Christ.

I had never heard of this book but just reading the caption about it, caught my attention. It is such a great book. I can't wait to get to the end of it. I highly recommend this book if you like to read really true miracles and believe in them."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This book -- a true-life story -- is a page-turner. Very well done as a born-again story, and has the marks of authenticity. Eventually the author got connected with the Billy Graham ministry and had to leave Pakistan. It's a book to read and give to a friend. This new edition (I read the old edition 20 years ago) has an update epilogue and a couple of fascinating appendixes. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Bilquis Sheikh was a traditional Muslim woman living in Pakistan during the 1960s. At the age of 52, after discontent with life she began examining the Koran in more depth to try to find greater purpose and hope for life. During her search, she noticed the prophet Jesus mentioned within the Koran and thought perhaps reading more on his teachings would be interesting.As one who came from a well respected and wealthy family, she had many resources and servants at her beckon. She instructed one of the servants to obtain a Bible for her and began to read it. Though it was in a difficult to understand version of the Urdu language, she became intrigued and had a couple dreams relating to John the Baptist and Jesus. She had not read about John prior to her dreams. The dreams struct her so vividly that she had to learn more and so cautiously approached a local Christian missionary.Over the next weeks and months, God revealed to her that the Jesus of the Bible was the true message of hope for life. She struggled tremendously with the decision to follow this Jesus of an aberrant religion and the implications of intense persecution/ostracization that she would experience if turning to Christ. However, she was continuously brought back to being at peace when dwelling on the things of the Bible and when she talked with God as if He were her father. She eventually surrendered to God and placed her full faith in Him and the promises of the Bible.The resulting persecution was very real both emotionally, materially, and socially. However, God grew her faith and continuously taught her and utilized her testimony for His glory throughout the rest of her life. This book provides good insight into Muslim society and the meaning of accepting Christ in that society. Not only is it a good read but also a true story."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"When I first read this book I couldn't stop reading it for I was caught up by the events that took place in Bilquis's life that would later bring her into the only faith that allowed her to call God &quot;Father&quot;. Living in a Muslim country I dare confirm the persecutions faced by Bilquis in her book are true. We have the same persecutions happening at where I'm from. From using white Muslims as freaks to convice the potential &quot;apostates&quot; that even white &quot;Christians&quot; embrace Islam to issuing death threats in scaring the new converts to denounce their new found faith. It is not easy for a Muslim to convert to Christianity in a Muslim nation. They will lose everything (family, possesions, nationality, etc.) sometimes even their lives. The sad thing is most Muslims still believe that their faith is tolerant thus denying stories like Bilquis's as fiction. Therefore to convince these Muslims they should try and convert to Christianity and see what happens to them. Such stubborn ignorance prevents them from seeing the Truth thus it is a miracle for them to convert to Christianity. Stories like Bilquis's are an inspiration to us that God's miracles do happen. And yes I cried at every incident that brought her closer to calling God &quot;Father&quot;. Romans 8: 14-17 &quot;For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot; it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.&quot;John"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"The thing I hated about this book was that I was reading it inbetween breaks at work, and sometimes I had to put it down. It was gripping throughout, and though the writing might not be that of Chaucer or Dickins I give it 5 stars because it was so inspirational and encouraging. I want to be like her! &quot;I Dared&quot; describes the process of a Pakistani noble woman coming to a belief in Jesus as Lord, through dreams and reading the Bible on her own- though there is continual Christian community around her and involved with her. She describes aspects of Islam positively, such as the call of the mu'ezzein from the minarets, which she found comforting, as do I. But she also describes times when Islamic belief and Pakistani culture serve to hurt. She doesn't do this negatively, but simply mentions the facts that happened to her.I was impressed, deeply, at how she was willing to be lead by God towards whatever He wanted. And not like she was a saint- she shares a process of learning to give up her rights in favor of God's. Particularly moving was the segment where she realizes the necessity of forgiving even her former husband, and how she goes from a place of, &quot;No, I can't do that at all God.&quot; to &quot;Yes, and if he came to my house today I would welcome him.&quot; I also enjoyed her detailing of the process by which she learned to hear God's voice. She wasn't hung up on a lot of regulations that had built up over the centuries in Christendom about what to do or not to do, how to be baptized or receive the Spirit, how you listen and what you must do or not do to avoid certain practices- she just listened and tried to obey. And at the times when she didn't obey, she relates with complete honesty how she learned through that.I think this is the most stunning part of the book- the complete honesty. She doesn't try to make herself better or more important, as certain bios of great Christians in America might do. She just related what God had done, in taking a broken jar and remolding it. Her openness opens up the world of the Spirit."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This book showed me how \\"our battle is not against flesh and blood\\". God spoke to B. Sheikh in incredible ways, which we sometimes find \\"spooky\\" or unbelievable. But, her testimony of how she came to faith reminds me that God works in the supernatural realm, conquering the spirit and occult world. God will overcome \\"the powers of this dark world\\" and \\"the spiritual forces of evil\\" and bring peace, just as he did in the author's life."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Bilquis' story of her search for God and the way He found her shows the depths of his love for lost sinners and the powerful way he draws men to him. As the story unfolds, you can see how God is working out everything in the background, through dreams, events, chance encounters and situations to orchestrate the salvation of her soul. This is especially revealed in the Afterword written by Synove Mitchell, the missionary that Bilquis' first consulted, the despair that was going on in her spiritual life at the time, and her fervent prayers to God to show her meaning in her ministry.After her conversion, Bilquis learns to walk with God, to feel for his Presence and to follow his leading. This part is very humbling for me because I have not yet learned to walk as Bilquis has, perhaps because I have too much material, Bible study notes, commentaries, preaching, programs, that I have not learned to lean solely on God, and what he wants me to do. I pray that I can develop the sensitivity that Bilquis has, about moving in his will, staying in his presence and his fellowship and then obey. Even though she was shunned by her family, threatened by the villagers, and almost had her house burned down, Bilquis learned to trust only in God and his timing. She was bold in her witness, she did what God told her to do, and was used by him to bring other villagers to Christ. Bilquis also recounts times when she grieved the Spirit, when she let her old self get in the way, and her immediate sense of being further away from God.Servants and neighbors observed the changes that God made in Bilquis' life after her salvation. Whereas before, she was imperious, prideful, and hard to please. She became gentle, gracious, and giving. After years of observing her, her Muslim servant received Jesus as Saviour because she too wanted to know God, and asked Jesus to come into her heart. They both \\"have tasted that the Lord is gracious\\" (1 Peter 2:3)So it can be for you too, if you want to taste of the heavenly gift, then just ask God to show Himself to you. While visiting a hospital, she met a doctor who told her \\"there is only one way to find out why you feel this way. And that is to find out for yourself, strange as that may seem. Why don't you pray to the God you're searching for? Ask Him to show you His way. Talk to Him as if He is your friend.... Talk to Him as if He were your father.\\""},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This was one of the most inspiring books I have read in a very long time! It is so wonderful that one person can be so committed to doing what she knows is right, however wrong it may seem to others around her.Bequilis becomes a very dedicated Christian, which is enough to make any Christian take a very long and hard look at whether they are indeed following God's will for their lives.The fact that this is a true story made me very aware that our God is a living God who will guide and answer us in all we do and ask."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"As a self-professed non-reader, I stayed up to 3AM just so I could finish the book! How amazing God is! It is a story of a woman - a Muslim by birth, with connection to high ranking Afghanistan officials and of upper class family connections - who one day came upon Jesus Christ in a dream which began her lifelong journey to seek the true God. Bilquis Sheikh risked everything - even her life and her love for her grandson Mahmud - to follow Christ. What was so hard to put down were the words that intricately described her emotional connection to God - something which practing Muslim must deny - and to have a personal relationship with Him. Her knowledge of the Quran and the Bible gave her an immeasurable platform which God used her even in the midst of death threats and personal sanctification. To be set apart for Christ was what she desired! I read the updated version of this book which gave some historical context to her life after she came to United States and the tragic murder of her beloved grandson Mahmud, who was defending a person from an \\"honor killing\\" (a practice where Muslims kill a family member because they became 'traitors' to the Islamic faith). The book is truly God-inspired, words in which gave me an encouraging view of my faith in Christ and how NOTHING is for my own and glory but that ALL THINGS ARE FOR CHRIST'S GLORY. \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me...\\" Philippians 4:13"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Isaiah 65:1 says, \\"I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me. I was found by those who did not seek me.\\"That is what happened to the lady in this story. As a casual Muslim living in Pakistan, she was neither looking for God nor interested in Him. Above all, she was certainly not looking for Jesus. Yet, God pursued her and awakened in her the eternity He has placed in every human heart (Ecclesiastes 3:11).Once awakened, the thirst for God in her intensified and spurred her personal search for this One who invaded her quiet moments with His Presence and awakened her in the night.This is a captivating true story of God's miraculous and passionate pursuit of a lost soul. I found that I could not read as fast as I wanted to in order to learn what happened next. This book will encourage you in your prayers for lost friends and also challenge you to personally live a life more completely committed to Christ.This book arrived in the mail just yesterday afternoon.

From the way this Muslim woman first encounters Jesus; its like reading an event that would have happened in the Bible. You become more and more involved with her as she carefully begins to ask dangerous questions about this \\" Jesus and the Bible\\" vs. the Quran and what she has been brought up to believe through her culture. As you read her story you begin to get more glimpses into her family life and her personal emotions; its like you are walking next to her. You can also see some of her struggles are not as different from some of our own. Pride; and self reliance to name a few. Its written in an easy to read way and the pages just flew by. I like her honesty when it comes to the developing relationship with God and His presence. As interesting, is the people that God brought into her life as she grows in her knowledge of Him. She had to rely on God in ways that most of us don't have to.The book I read also had an Epilogue: After the Book; which was a delight. It allowed friends who helped her in the beginning; an opportunity to add their insights.

She lives to walk in fellowship with her heavenly Father, and she introduces many others to Him, as well, until the day she is forced to flee her homeland for America.This sweet book will deepen your love for our heavenly Father, as well as increase your desire to minister to others like Bilquis, who need to know the God who has revealed Himself as a loving Father.

It also influenced my understanding of people of the Middle East. This is a wonderful, true story that was hard to put down. I had to read it slowly, so as not to miss a nuance...Bilques Sheikh was one amazing, courageous woman who taught me so much in this little book. Wish I could have heard her speak.I encourage anyone - whether a believer or interested in the Christian faith, to read this book. It will breath new life in the Western Christian's walk."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This is a great testimony of a Muslim coming to Christ, written a number of years ago when there weren't so many such testimonies. We praise God for the many more who are coming to Christ today. If you like this book you might also want to know about Reema Goode's bookWhich None Can Shut: Remarkable True Stories of God's Miraculous Work in the Muslim World."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Bilquis Sheikh shows us how God reveals Himself to her hungry heart. Even though she had never read the Bible, or heard much about the God of the Christian Bible, He began revealing Himself to her and led her to get a Bible. Like a hungry child, she took the Bible for the Truth that it is and sought out a missionary in her area. This is a story about how God reveals Himself to anyone who will seek Him; and it is a story about how He comes near those who trust in Him alone. The reader is pulled into the story to share the life of this precious woman as she grows in the knowledge of God. The comments by the missionary at the end of this edition are pure gold as well. I would recommend this book to anyone - it is an easy read and will give you food for thought."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"i love how the author was always feeling for god's presence. when she did not feel it she retraced her stesp to find where she had walked away. this is something we should all try!"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I found the book easy to read.

It captivated and intrigued me. It comforts me to know that even without human intervention and influence, God will woo seekers to Himself and provide the answers sought. Initially speaking to her in a dream, God awakens in B Sheikh a hunger for truth. As a Muslim woman , she is aware of the cost of her choices. I deeply appreciated the honesty of the author in sharing her genuine fears, her sometimes self-centredness and pride of heritage and social status, and the Spirits speaking to her in refining and pruning. I found myself understanding Presence in a whole new way, and wanting for myself the kind of intimate communion B. Sheikh had. A powerful testimony of a Muslims search for Presence and God's gift of Himself."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This book shows just how God will look after a person completely if you are fully committed to obeying Him."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This story is very well told and is an excellent example of how one persons search for the truth beyond what they have experienced or been exposed to... Due to the unsatisfied, unfulfilled desire from within to really know her purpose here in life, Bilquis is prepared to shift her paradigm completely and see all things from a completely different perspective which then changes her position on many of the conditioned, taught things she was so used to. This book really is a truthful account of one womans search for fulfillment and a burning desire to come to that knowledge at whatever cost. It is a testament to perseverance and a right attitude which always bring the truly REAL result. If only more of the world had her attitude and committment to the meaningful things of life. Her desire to know her purpose and fulfill it carried her thru' to knowing and doing it!! Her experience also shows how when one is determined all things are possible to him/her who believes!!!!"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This is a wonderful book! I admire the faith that Bilquis had at the time of the persecution she was facing. She stood on God's Word and remained faithful, thus she was made safe and blessed. Anyone involved in a ministry to Muslims should read this. It is also very inspiring to all Christians in keeping the faith and knowing that God still performs miracles, even today. Dare to call Him Father, remain faithful to His Word and see the life-changing miracles He will do in your life."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"How do I give myself to God completely?What happens when I do?If these question were come from anyone of religion free country, that's not strange.

This book is a guide book. Don't get caught up in the gripping story and miss the wonderful lessons."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! The author had a remarkable experience in the way she came to know Jesus, and the way she describes her ensuing experiences provides many very clear lessons on how to listen to God's voice and to stay in His presence.The clarity of her descriptions and the spiritual depth of her life have had a lasting effect on me, and I think often of things that she said and described and am able to apply them to my own life.

How amazing God is! It is a story of a woman - a Muslim by birth, with connection to high ranking Afghanistan officials and of upper class family connections - who one day came upon Jesus Christ in a dream which began her lifelong journey to seek the true God. Bilquis Sheikh risked everything - even her life and her love for her grandson Mahmud - to follow Christ. What was so hard to put down were the words that intricately described her emotional connection to God - something which practing Muslim must deny - and to have a personal relationship with Him. Her knowledge of the Quran and the Bible gave her an immeasurable platform which God used her even in the midst of death threats and personal sanctification. To be set apart for Christ was what she desired! I read the updated version of this book which gave some historical context to her life after she came to United States and the tragic murder of her beloved grandson Mahmud, who was defending a person from an \\"honor killing\\" (a practice where Muslims kill a family member because they became 'traitors' to the Islamic faith). The book is truly God-inspired, words in which gave me an encouraging view of my faith in Christ and how NOTHING is for my own and glory but that ALL THINGS ARE FOR CHRIST'S GLORY. \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me...\\" Philippians 4:13"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This story is so wonderful! It is a joy to see how God is able to speak to a person so clearly--despite cultural obstacles to belief. This woman finds true faith in the Most High God. May many more Muslims find such faith and have the courage to embrace the truth to which God Himself leads them. Bilquis Sheikh has encouraged me to believe more strongly in what God can do and in who He is. She depicts what it means to trust and obey God as a father, even in the hostile environment a Muslim convert to Christianity faces."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I'm trying to find the words, but the only thing that comes close is refreshing. At the time I read this, I was in a very dry place, but her tale planted a seed to allow God to raise me out of it.It reminded me of the basic truths and just how complicated we make religion. The truth is God wants our obedience and through it all, he loves us unconditionally.Great story and truly inspiring!"},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Very easy to read, so it goes quickly.

The writing is not perhaps as good as inThe Hiding Place(another similarly remarkable lady, by the way), but the story is still compelling."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I first heard of this woman when she was on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson way back in the early 1980's. She was interviewed and told how she came to know Jesus, when God called her to come to Him. She had been the wife of a very important head of state, and she was well known and respected. She kept this part of her life a secret for a very long time as if she was found out they would have killed her. She tells about how God would take her out of body over to america or some other continent to pray for someone that was sick, and the return her later to her body. She was sold out to the Lord, and fell in love with Jesus, as we all must do, and He began to use her to win other souls, and to heal the sick. It is a touching testimony of God's Love for all, and how He longs for all to come to Him.

I know my husband is hearing them now."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"This is an autobiographical book of the author ( A Muslim woman -high class with a notable social position- mother of three kids, a grandmother who adopted her grandson as son) how Christ choose to reach her and how her whole life transformed by His touch. She is led to reread Koran in connection with her kid being treated for evil spirits by a mauli. She feels like reading earlier works to Koran; take a interest in Bible. In this period, she has a dream where she dines with Lord Jesus; When he vanishes, she finds someone whom she calls as John Baptist and asks him for guidance. Later she has an interesting a dream where a perfume saleman visits her and leaves a goldan jar of perfume on the table. When she gets up, she finds Bible at the place on the table. She meets a Chiristian missonaries couple and asks about John Baptist. Later She finds a specific passage in Bible where tha analogy of perfume and Good News is given. Now she is concevied that the dreams were from God. Once again, she is forced to visit hospital for her son's ear problem. There she meets a Christian Nun who manages the hospital. When the author expresses her confusion between Muslim belief and Christian belief, she is suggested to pray to God as father. This is the turning point. [ The book is titled on this aspect].She reminds about how her father cared for her. She dares to call God as Father. She is lead to pray for Holy Spirit and gets it. Later she is guided to take Baptism in her bath tub. She also takes traditional baptism.Now her relatives boycot her. But she stands witness to Christ with boldness. Here one understands the rich man's problem in Bible; She has to forego her social position, security, and respect. She also has to risk losing her son. She puts Christ above anything.Later her whole life changes. She also finds strength to forgive her husband; She acts as a medium for her relatives in crisis to taste the PEACE Given by Lord JESUS. Later she is invited to a Bill Graham's meeting in Singapore. This shows that she becomes the tool in God's hands.Changed poticial conditions in Paktisan promotes her to visit USA for a four month tour arranged by Christian friends. Later She is forced to settle in U.S.A. She becomes an active Lord's witness in U.S.A.I have read the book many times. Easy to read. Not a theological book; The message is is simple:Dare to call GOD as your father."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Although the events occurred in the late 60's & early 70's, Ms. Sheikh's account of her spiritual journey is riveting. She details her discouragement with her religion (Islam) & her longing for a fulfilling relationship with God. When a friend suggested that she talk to God as though to her father, she experienced a profound change in her life that got better & better with time. She sought out some Christian acquaintances (who were at first reluctant to talk to her), but eventually she was able to read the Bible with them and learn more about Jesus and the Father. She was a fairly elite & wealthy person so was not disturbed by harassment for awhile. But eventually she received threats, & local Muslims tried to burn her house. She persevered, but eventually came to the US. I recommend her story very highly."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"At first I was turned off by Bilquis Sheikh's exorbitant lifestyle -- her many servants, her large house and her sense of entitlement; however, as she tells her story, which begins with a genuine haunting (a dark mist that moves through her garden), I began to see the hand of God in directing her to Christianity. Her story is told forthrightly, and her dreams and visions seem very consistent with the Bible. Ms. Sheikh has numerous experiences that lead her from Islam's thorny road to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If Ms. Sheikh were alive today, however, I would ask her if she truly thinks a God of Mercy and Justice would save her and yet condemn to hell her father and mother, whom she loved (especially her father), just because they were Muslim. My own faith in God believes the dictate that eventually every knee shall bend and every tongue confess Christ, and that hell will give up its dead. Although real, hell has a remedial purpose and people don't go there because they choose the wrong religion. Indeed, while Jesus was dead, he spent three days preaching to the spirits in prison. God is one of mercy, and I believe that Ms. Sheikh is not in heaven's bliss whilst her father burns in an everlasting hell.God's mercy revealed itself to Ms. Sheikh, and of special note is a vision, or dream, of John the Baptist before she even knew there was a John the Baptist. In like manner, aspects of the Gospel were revealed to her line upon line. I would have liked to know more about the evil that was going on in her garden. Did it only appear once? Had she had an experience of hauntings? \\"Shadow people\\" often manifest themselves as mist and create sensations of darkness, even in the light.Ms. Sheikh is lucky to be alive, coming from a culture where barbaric \\"honor killings\\" are tolerated by Islamic leaders and by the people themselves. There is very little freedom of religion, and for someone of Ms. Sheikh's status, she might very well have been found brutally murdered in her garden. Islam's teachings require women to cover themselves because of the core teaching that men are pigs who cannot help but rape a woman if a body part is showing. Indeed, in Pakistan and the Islamic regions round about, women who are raped quite often are murdered by members of their own family or the family of the man, or men, who raped them. Adultery is tolerated for men, but for women it's an instant death sentence. And for those who leave Islam, if they once had embraced it, death is all too often the sentence for both men and women. Islam can be ignored, but never abandoned, and Ms. Sheikh, who held the Bible in one hand and the Qur'an in the other, dared to ask the Almighty, \\"Which of these are of thee?\\"\\"Through which of them did you find Me?\\" the answer came. At that moment, all of Islam's claims that the early Christians falsified their records and that Jesus did not die flew out the window, and only then did she dare to call the Almighty God \\"Father.\\"This is a book Muslims should carefully consider. They also should consider that no one else experienced Muhammad's visions. No one else saw the angel. No one else heard the voice (and even if they had, how could they know it was of God?) No scriptures pointed the way to Muhammad as the \\"seal\\" of the prophets. No successors were named. Everything rested on the claims of but one man, when the Law clearly stated, \\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.\\" Muslims should read Isaiah 53 as well as Zachariah 12 and 14. They also should read that even Satan can appear as an angel of light. Even Muhammad confidentially approached a Christian friend wondering if his experiences were of the Devil. And at times he even doubted his own sanity.For a reason known only to God, He revealed Himself to Bilquis Sheikh, who wrote of her experience.

While Bilquis's book is an awesome story on her conversion, two things impacted me the most: how Jesus supernaturally pursued her, and how He moved supernaturally in her life. It was a lesson I've never forgotten, that Jesus wants that relationship with me also, enough to pursue me supernaturally, physically, and in such a real way. Her book opened the door for me to experience the supernatural and to know that God moves that way today. She taught me that I, too, can have dreams where God speaks to me, that I too can dine with him and physically feel his presence, and that I too can have that intimacy with Jesus. Her book was a springboard for me into an intimate relationship with Jesus that has never stopped, I've only grown more passionate and more hungry for His presence than ever before. She taught me to walk with Jesus in the spiritual, supernatural realm, and that that intimate relationship makes the Christian walk an adventure that is unbelievable. I am madly in love with Jesus, and Bilquis showed me some of what that can look like, how real that can be. No other book, other than the Bible, has ever impacted me as much as her book has."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"I sat down I read 75% of the book without putting it down.

I only wish I could learn more about her life after the epilouge."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"It never ceases to amaze me how awesome God is and how mysteriously He works in the lives of people throughout the world. A woman like Bilquis Sheikh coming to Christ shows His absolute power in working in the lives of those who genuinely seek Him. I was given this book by a lady who was born a Muslim and lives in a Muslim land. It highly impacted her life for the good. Also, having known a number of Muslims who have converted to Christianity, I have seen the sad reality of how a Muslim family can totally reject and mistreat one of their own who converts. For a Muslim to follow Christ, much sacrifice takes place. The account of Bilquis Sheikh proves that this sacrifice is worth making. As you read this account of what happened in the life of one lady who &quot;dared to call God Father,&quot; you will be swept up in the excitement and emotions of God's wonderful work. It is a book that Muslims and Christians alike should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"I Dared to Call Him Father","review":"Anyone who thinks all is well in the world of professed Christianity needs to read this book.

The very name means great writing. Alas, the man himself died, by his own hand, decades ago. No more great writing from him. But no! Fortune, my friends, has smiled on the book lover this day. It seems the great author squirreled away several manuscripts he wrote in the 1950s, and the Hemingway Foundation has just released the one he called \\"the African book.\\" UNDER KILIMANJARO isn't just a book. It's an experience.You'll have to forgive my gushing. I've spent the last few weeks hunting in Africa with \\"Papa\\" Hemingway and his fourth wife, Mary. That's what it felt like, too -- like I was out there on the plains of Kenya, sleeping in a tent at night with the roar of a lion rumbling through the dark air. The book's pace is deliberately slow, which gives the reader a sense of the timelessness of the camp by the plains under the great African mountain. So we listen in on the talk around the campfire and watch birds soar overhead almost in real time. When the hunt is on, we follow both the hunter and the hunted.The book purports to be fiction, but it is every inch a memoir. Papa and Mary are, after all, the main characters. There are several levels to enjoy -- the pure literary quality, the exciting adventure, the enjoyable travelogue, the often humorous commentary. And it's a love story, but not what you'd expect; it's a tribute to his beloved Africa: \\"In Africa a thing is true at first light and a lie by noon and you have no more respect for it than for the lovely, perfect weed-fringed lake you see across the sun-baked salt plain. You have walked across that plain in the morning and you know that no such lake is there. But now it is there absolutely true, beautiful and believable.\\"In some of my favorite passages, he remembers his old writing pals, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound and others. He recalls how much he loved Paris in \\"the old days\\" and talks about Havana, Key West and the Spanish Civil War. These references pop up when you least expect them.He goes from self-effacing to arrogant, sometimes in the same paragraph. His prose is at the same time gritty and elegant. Sometimes it's moving, sometimes it's funny, always it's fascinating.The book itself has an introduction that explains the details of the posthumous publication. In back, the reader can find a glossary of Swahili terms, a list of characters and notes on the editing of the text. On the inside covers are reproductions of actual manuscript pages in Hemingway's own handwriting. Nina Smart has provided simple, almost iconic African drawings for each chapter heading."},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"Readers should be aware that this \\"last\\" book by Hemingway is not really new.

Both are based on the same unfinished manuscript, but edited by different people & put out by different publishers - \\"True at First Light\\" was edited by Hemingway's son Patrick and published by Scribner. Of the 2 accounts, \\"Under Kilimanjaro\\" is significantly longer, clocking in at over 100 pages more than \\"First Light.\\""},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"My first Hemingway experience, ironically, his final work? Halfway through my 4th of his offerings at this time, I am inspired to read his entire catalogue. The characters were varied, rich and endearing.

One could sense the congenial yet mildly tempestuous dynamic maintained between the various tribesman and the employees of the British colonists and Hemingway. A familiar, symbiotic relationship of convenience. Takes a little while to become acquainted with the characters and their surroundings because of the frequent Swahili based references, but this should not deter one from moving forward or beginning this novel. In time, this becomes a non issue and actually contributes to the unique flavor of this work. When my wife started to read this novel, I suggested that she take note of the glossary at the back. In retrospect, I would have done so after reading the introduction, prior to beginning chapter one and perhaps used it as an occasional guide throughout the reading. A thoroughly enjoyable visit to early 1950's East Africa with a unique individual.Joe Jessome"},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"Under Kilimanjaro was Hemingway's last book and was an autobiographical novel about the country he knew and grew to love when he spent several months in Kenya between 1953 and 1954 - but it was completed in 1956 and is the last of his manuscripts to be published in its entirety. No definitive Hemingway collection could be without Under Kilimanjaro: co-editors Robert Lewis and Robert Fleming have aspired to produce a complete reading text of Hemingway's original and their work makes for an important, definitive polishing of Hemingway's final creation."},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"I have always been skeptical judging the books published after his death and whether they really could be called Hemingway books since they were unfinished and unsigned by the author for publication.If a writer writes a story and that story is unfinished and considered for that reason by the author to be unpublishable, can you really include it the canon of his works?Will his reputation be affected by it as these books have undoubtably affected Hemingways? Have they at least created a perception in the value of his work from beginning to end?The Old Man and the Sea was the last book he authorized for book publication and anything that was published after (his death) should be judged as a curiousity and not a finished work to base a reputation on. Under Kilimanjaro is a work in progress. It was first published in a shorter version and called True At First Light . It is not a great book but it is entertaining and an interesting curio to have and to read.Now lets see the \\"The Garden of Eden\\" without the cuts(if you are going to publish these manuscripts do it the right way!) and the letters being collected written by the most influential literary stylist of the 20th century.Note added 08/2010; 1st vol of penn state letters project Vol 1 submitted and to be published next year."},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"\\"Under Kilimanjaro\\" is a welcome addition to the volume of work done by Hemingway and others on his two major African safaris- one in 1933 and then 20 years later in 1953. We're taken along with him and the native guides stalking lions, wildebeest and other dangerous, yet beautiful animals out in the wild, through dense underbrush, along rocky cliffs and down hazardous embankments to watering holes rimmed with zebras, hyenas and vultures, all in their native habitat. Hemingway loved Africa- and it comes out clearly in this book, which is a near literal transciption of his notes from the last safari which almost cost him his life in plane crashes on the return trip.Striking in this story is how easily Hemingway turns a travelogue into a novel- something that is not easily done even by accomplished writers. The reader is taken along for the ride into the back country, far from any city or town, removed from the comforts of civilization- and endangered by neighboring warring tribes bent on capturing new territory and robbing anything they can get from hapless tourists. One is reminded of the travesties which have occurred in recent years to people travelling to these and other dangerous places around the world, where ruthless bandits have harmed and killed visitors in senseless acts of violence. In this book, you feel as if you're sitting there with Hemingway, waiting for the target to come into range... and knowing that your own life could be in danger.\\"Under Kilimanjaro\\" is an interesting read- and a nice supplement to \\"The Green Hills of Africa\\" and also \\"True at First Light\\". In his final days, Hemingway often said in interviews that he had a cache of unpublished material which would support his wife and other heirs after he died. Well, his widow Mary Walsh died in 1986, 25 years after he committed suicide, but mankind is enriched and supported in our reading with this fine work.-Gene PisasaleAuthor, \\"Lafayette's Gold- The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\" and\\"Vineyard Days\\""},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"Who am I to rate Hemmingway? This was an entertaining story of a period in Hemmingway's life in Africa. Told well with a fair amount of detail. It brought back memories of Kenya accurately. As an aside, my 8th grade English teach would not have approved of many of the sentences, but they worked well in carrying the narrative. I was disappointed in his treatment of his wife, who came off as an airhead, and of his African servants who were not much better. I am not a moralist, but I was appalled that he had sex with his African &#34;fiance&#34; the day his wife flew to Nairobi. Finally, this is an unfinished novel, and reading an unfinished novel is like having sex without an orgasm. Nice, but what's the point."},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"I prefer this version to 'True at First Light', the other posthumous fiction/autobiography published from Hemingway's manuscripts. There is more to wade through, but the prose is so beautiful he even makes his snarky comments about other writers a joy. This isn't the best of Hemingway by any stretch; his short stories along with 'The Sun Also Rises' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' are the best in my opinion. At this stage, Hemingway is dealing with issues surrounding mortality and the writing is much more petulant.It is fun to see him rip a critic (an unnamed reader from Iowa), but at the same time it is the sort of retribution somone of his stature should rise above.But these are small quibbles. Overall, the book is worth reading on its own, and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Under Kilimanjaro","review":"Hemingway left his memoirs of his African safari in a Havana bank vault. These memoirs were stored away as insurance for future publication. Hemingway had requested that these rough drafts never be published after his death. The Authors of this book should have respected his orders.Under Kilimanjaro is an attempt to resurrect the ghost of Hemingway's great writing skills, and in so doing, it fails miserably. Part of Hemingway's trademark was to edit a work to its bare essentials. This book fails in this regard as well.The plot essentially revolves around his wife's obsession to kill a lion. Her obsessive-compulsive temper tantrums are a common occurrence throughout the book. In other events, Hemingway is in a continues killing and drinking spree. There are, however, some entertaining moments, mainly when Hemingway's reflects on his past adventures in France and Spain.In short this book should have been left in a vault in Havana. . For a more accurate account, one should read \\"the Snows of Kilimanjaro\\". Under Kilimanjaro amounts to a poor representation of a great man's skill. It is an attempt by his family to profit from his legacy by trying to resurrect his ghost."},{"Title":"The Jazz Crusade: The Inside Story of the Great New Orleans Jazz Revival of the 1960'S/Includes Compact Disk","review":"This is the complete, unedited review of The Jazz Crusade with permission as it appeared in the July/August 1992 issue of the Mensa Bulletin - the American Mensa magazine.Unquestionably a collector's item, this book contains a 70 minute compact disc, \\"The Best of the Jazz Crusade\\"! As a musician, bandleader, promoter, record producer, and writer of the era, Big Bill (who hails from our Southern Connecticut chapter) has chronicled the revival of early black jazz, the beginnings of Preservation Hall, the influx of young white musicians into New Orleans, and the spread of the movement throughout the world.

The great New Orleans jazz revival began in the late 1930s with Blue Note Records, and had peaked by the late 1950s. The 1960s had NOTHING to do with it, even though a small band of enthusiasts continued to worship the style, stultifying it in the process.

John Taylor, a devout Jeffersonian, wrote this treatise to refute the monarchial ideas of John Adams as espoused in his \\"Defence of the Constitutions of the United States\\".Taylor lays waste to Adams and other conservatives ideas that there must be a balance of orders among men in society and government. Taylor rejects the forms of the English government, lords, commons and king, and instead embraces the sovereignty of the people through a written constitution and republican government. Pointed out are the moral principles of republican government as embodied in the American Revolution, which Taylor considers as an epochial event which changed the way men viewed government. Taylor believes good government is nurtured by good principles at the foundation of a government. He rejects the ideals of fraud, force, and coercion to govern men, which Adams, Hobbes and Sir Robert Filmer believe to be man in his natural state. Taylor believes men can live free if their form of government has good moral priciples infused throughout. These principles are a division of power between state and federal authority, the sovereignty of the people, and local and statewide self government.Taylor also rejects the idea of strong central government as in the British model, especially before the American Revolution. He rejects a central bank and subsidies for private enterprise as destructive to the public good, a vehicle to corrupt government and centralize power. He believes these events will destroy the principles of the American Revolution. Taylor also takes umbrage at Adams glorification of aristocracy and monarchy as faulty and based on the corruption of the English system.Although this book is difficult reading, due to Taylor's expansive and complex vocabulary, it is well worth a purchase to investigate the true principles of the American Republic and Revolution. All those interested in liberty, freedom and self government will enjoy this large volume. Set time aside in a quiet place without interuption to read this book. Read it slowly and over several months time and the full effect will be felt.A great read."},{"Title":"Living My Life (2 Volumes) (American Biography Series)","review":"I have no issue with the book itself, I'd just like those who purchase this book to know that this is only the first half of Emma Goldmans \\"Living My Life\\". I bought this copy under the impression that it would be her entire autobiography. It would be helpful if this important piece of information were included in the description of this book somewhere."},{"Title":"Living My Life (2 Volumes) (American Biography Series)","review":"I consider this autobiography as essential reading for anyone interested in the history of the United States, or early 20th century international political history. Beyond its value as a historical document, 'Living My Life' is also a gripping read. Goldman was a real adventurer, a real revolutionary after a design that seems forgotten today. The stories that come from her rough and tumble experiences in America, the still-born Soviet Union, and Europe, are breathtaking, heartbreaking, and pertinent in our own age of political and economic instability.I firmly believe that this book should be required reading in American high schools or junior highs, especially for young women. The very fact that Goldman still comes off as so dangerously radical is testimony to both her brilliance and courage, and to the lack of change that typifies most of the world's social systems.I agree with other reviewers' assessment of Goldman's writing abilities, but she was an ideologue more than an artist. Where her political philosophy is concerned, she is definitely uncompromising. However, Goldman seems to me much more human than many of the era's major revolutionary figures. Her devotion to the liberation and well-being of women and her renouncement of terrorist tactics in her later life demonstrate this quite sufficiently. The long relationship between Goldman and Alexander Berkman reveals the personal cost of revolutionary activity and is probably worth a book of its own."},{"Title":"Living My Life (2 Volumes) (American Biography Series)","review":"The Autobiography of Emma Goldman was a fascinating read. I could not put the book down. I am a history teacher and am fascinated with United States history from 1890-1920.

While many groups today are applying complexity and agent-based modeling to combat, the models developed by Ilachinski and described in this book, ISAAC and EINSTein, are the true pioneers, and the story behind their development is fascinating.Following the Vietnam War, a major rethinking about the type of education and skills needed to fight a modern-day war resulted in many reforms that led to the U.S. military's swift victory in \\"Operation Desert Storm\\" in 1991. Building on those successes, the United States Marine Corps undertook a search for new discoveries with the potential to influence the military's thinking about and readiness for future conficts. Through this effort they learned about the emerging new field of nonlinear studies, also known as chaos theory and complexity science.In 1995, under the direction of Lt. General Paul K. Van Riper (now retired) an \\"Office of New Sciences\\" was established within the Marine Corps Combat Development Command--a sort of futures think tank for the Marine Corps--to explore the possible applications of complexity to the Marine Corps' strategic thinking about the future of combat.In the Forward to this book General Van Riper writes, \\"In an initial discussion Dr. Ilachinski (employed by the Center for Naval Analysis and invited by Gen. Van Riper to meet with him to discuss these ideas) suggested we focus our research on the relevance of complexity theory to land combat because of its unique characteristics, these being hierarchically organized units engaged in multifaceted interactions with each other and the enemy over complicated terrain.\\" This book is the story of the project, insights and models that resulted from those early conversations.Despite (I write with a laugh) his math and physics background, Ilachinski is a wonderful writer, taking his time with each subject and thus making this book accessible to the nonscientist with a basic understanding of complexity. It's also fun to work with the basic model (described here in detail) and explore some of the more abstract ideas from complexity and their applications to many domains beyond those for which it was originally developed (namely, combat). There is also within this book a self-contained primer on complexity. I was so impressed with the clarity of this section that I asked the book's publisher to make this section available as a separate publication (to which they agreed) for my workshops and seminars on complexity. This book is a valued reference that I have used over and over. As an aside, Andy is also an accomplished photographer (visit his photography website) whose stunning photographs capture nature's elegance, simplicity, beauty and complexity.As a final tribute to Ilachinski's incredible pioneering work, General Van Riper writes in the book's Forward, \\"When histories of this era are written Dr. Andrew Ilachinski is likely to emerge as the 'Father of Military Complexity Research'...Those in positions with responsibility for planning and conducting the Nation's defense today and into the foreseeable future ignore this book at great peril for it offers deep and meaningful insights into war on land.\\" You won't be disappointed with this book.

There are some good tidbits of information on all sorts of applications which are already common in the Linux world: OpenVPN, OpenLDAP and OpenPGP to name a few. It could be a hard road for Windows administrators (at first) to go down the Open Source path.. and this book is good guide to get going on that path if you want to explore."},{"Title":"Open Source for Windows Administrators","review":"When you hear the term Open Source many people think only of Linux and Linux based programs. While Linux is Open Source software there is plenty of Open Source software available for Windows too. Some of the programs and tools discussed in this book include the following: Cygwin, which allows the use of the bash shell and related powerful scripting language inside Windows, Python and its use as a scripting language, WinPT, the Windows Privacy Tools, OpenPGP Public Key Server, OpenVPN, a virtual private network server and client, XYNTService which allows running console scripts as a service, OpenLDAP, a LDAP server, SAMBA file and print server that shares between Windows and Linux and can act as a Domain Controller, MySQL SQL server, Apache web server, Xmail server, and OpenOffice, an office productivity suite. For each of the packages it includes installation instructions, configuration, and basis instructions on how to use it as well as where to go for additional documentation. These are all very useful programs that can make your Windows administration easier and more efficient. Open Source for Windows Administrators is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"An intricate, well-paced plot full of pathos and farce.

I particularly enjoy Mr. Carmichael's rendition because he has a lovely range of accents and vocal patterns that easily differentiate the characters.

Parts of the solution were glossed over quickly leaving confusion and other parts were explained ad nauseum. The ideas and plot were good. The end came too quickly without a good summation/ conclusion to the story. It sort of left you hanging."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"The book is a nice, though a bit longish, detective story - it's about detecting a crime that was imposssible to be committed in the first place, and about Harriet Vane's and Lord Peter Wimsey's rather unpromising, but interesting, romance.And it's howlingly funny at parts. Unfortunately, not the parts that the writer intended to be funny.For a writer who always was so painstakingly correct about timetibles, technicalities etc, Ms Sayers had made an astounding mess with her facts.The victim is a Russian - and Pavlo is his name. Sorry, Dorothy, had he been a Russian, his name would have been Pavel or Paul, given that we're supposed to be talking about Russian aristocracy. Pavlo is an Ukrainian name. It tantamount to calling a character Pierre and insisting he's an Englishman.Also, if one insists on the poor victim receiving letters with Czechoslovakian stamps, one should not make the evil-doers send them from Warsaw. Polish stamps would surely be better.Thirdly, it doesn't do to make seemingly intelligent characters speculate that an illness which can be inherited only through female ancestors could have been a proof positive that the sufferer is a descendant of a specified man... not after the female-line business was thoroughly explained in a previous paragraph, anyway.And, top of the tops, there comes a scene when the good British jurors are not too slighly ridiculed for thinking in cliches about the foreigners... Pavlo the Russian, letters from the capital of Poland with Czechoslovakian stamps on them - Dorothy Leigh Sayers, you've made my day!"},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"The second of Sayers' Wimsey/Vane mysteries, \\"Have His Carcase\\" never quite gripped me the way \\"Strong Poison\\" did. The earlier mystery placed Harriet Vane in jeopardy should Lord Peter prove unable to exonerate her. In this book there is no such risk-factor, consequently the story is little more than a mental exercise regimen for two not-so-old, not-so-dear friends (although they do get quite a bit better acquainted on this outing). The book is also a few chapters too long (or short, depending on your point of view); \\"the evidence of the mannequin,\\" for instance, made only a minor contribution to the denouement and could have been eliminated - or it could have been better capitalized upon and drawn in several of the women characters as suspects. The murder plot is definitely overcomplicated and would likely never occur in real life ... unless you wanted to commit a murder that would baffle the police and almost thwart Wimsey and Vane as well (in which case it's *exactly* what you'd do).For its several shortcomings, \\"Carcase\\" is still a very enjoyable read. The verbal sparring between Wimsey and Vane is priceless. Vane's perspective as a mystery novelist adds a bit of behind-the-scenes color. The local police force occasionally comes off a bit too indulgent of the amateur investigators, but it was very nice that they were portrayed as neither blustering know-it-alls nor no-nothing bumpkins. Bunter's quest through London involves some of the best written pacing I've ever read.A couple final points: The word \\"carcase\\" in the title would nowadays be written as \\"carcass.\\" Before reading the book I thought it had something to do with those large trunks that used to get strapped onto the back of cars. The title actually refers to the fact that before a murder investigation can go forward, the police need to have the body (or its remains) at hand. Point two: Don't read \\"the evidence of the cipher\\" (Chapter 28) when you are tired; while it provides a very good look at a cryptographer's work, it carries with it the potential risk of causing your head to explode. Be careful, you really wouldn't want that to happen. Trust me."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Dorothy L Sayers provided some of the great treasures to be found in the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;. A classical scholar with a formidable intellect, she was an eminent practitioner and an eloquent critic of detective fiction. Her feisty, detective fiction writing character, Harriet Vane, and her aristocratic, monocled, amateur detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, may be found together for the second time in her 1932 novel &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.On a walking holiday, while recovering from a court case in which she was alleged to have killed her lover, Harriet Vane discovers the body of a man. It is lying on rocks on a beach, close to low tide level. The evidence suggests suicide. After taking photographs with her camera, finding a cut throat razor and removing a shoe from the corpse, Harriet vainly tries to enlist help in moving the body before it is washed away by the incoming tide. The local police force is alerted and so is Lord Peter Wimsey.This is a long novel. Interest focuses not only on the solution to the mystery but also on the likelihood of Wimsey succeeding with his wish to marry Harriet. There is witty dialogue, there are fulsome reports from a range of eccentric characters, there are descriptions of the human anatomy and how it responds to the throat being cut, there is an interminable attempt to decode a ciphered letter, and there are classical quotations provided at the start of each chapter. There is little dramatic tension, no suspense, and no thrills. Dorothy L Sayers was a cultivated, fluent writer, sometimes boring but never banal.If your tolerance of boredom is low, but your credit balance at the bank is high, then invest in the audio tape reading of the book provided by Ian Carmichael. English actor Ian Carmichael has had great success associated with various adaptations of the novels of Dorothy L Sayers. He brings wonderful energy and gusto to this full-length reading, enough to keep you delighted for more than fifteen hours."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"I recommend this book primarily because it contains Lord Wimsey and Harriet's solution of a Playfair cipher.Most readers will recall Sherlock Holmes' solution of the Dancing Men cipher (recounted in Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Dancing Men) and Legrand's solution of Captain Kidd's cipher (recounted in Poe's The Gold Bug). Both of these are simple substitution ciphers, easily broken if one knows certain facts about the English language, such as the order of letter frequency (E, T, O, A, N . . .) The Playfair cipher, on the other hand, is an order of magnitude more difficult to solve. It is a digram cipher, using pairs of letters (there are 26x26=676 possible digrams) instead of individual letters to encrypt the message. Tables of digram frequencies are of little use in decrypting short messages. Other methods are required. The mechanics are explained in the text.The Playfair cipher was used operationally in WWII and to this day remains unsolvable as a one-time, short message, unknown-keyword cipher, unless you can guess one of the plaintext words. Wimsey and Harriet were lucky that they were dealing with an amateur.Sayer's audacious trump of Conan Doyle and Poe caught my attention. The rest of the book is, to put it mildly, well-plotted. There is evidence here that native British intelligence far exceeds what one finds in the colonies. No wonder Sayers is so popular."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"All of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries are worth reading. She has a command of English and a story-telling ability that makes her, in my opinion, one of the two greatest mystery writers of the twentieth century. Most of Ms. Sayers' mysteries feature Lord Peter, second son of the Duke of Denver. He is one of the most delightful characters in English literature and well worth meeting in any of Ms. Sayers books. Most of the Lord Peter mysteries stand alone and can be read without worrying about sequence. However four of the mysteries involve Harriet Vane, and for maximum enjoyment, those four mysteries should be read in order. Strong Poison describes the first meeting between Harriet and Lord Peter. Have His Carcase explores the relationship between the two of them as they investigate the death of a man whose body Harriet discovers while hiking along a deserted beach. The interaction between the two of them can best be understood and appreciated if Strong Poison is read first. Have His Carcase may be the least enjoyable of the four romance-mysteries involving Harriet, but this book leads to the final two books in the series, and those two books are the finest romance-mysteries ever written."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Though I eagerly awaited the Kindle editions of Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane novels, which are favorites of mine, the enormous number of typos make for laborious and irritating reading, with multiple errors per page. Indeed, were I not already intimate with the books, some passages woud make no sense as transcribed: my familiarity allows me to decode the errors. For ten dollars a book, Amazon, your readers deserve better.The book itself is literate and serves well to advance the relationship between the two main characters. From first book to last, Sayers' style develops from superficial to highly reflective and deeply emotional."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"I was quite enjoying this lengthy book - both the mystery itself and the Vane/Wimsey interactions - right up to the last page or so when the abrupt, vague, disappointing, and out of character ending left me completely flat. It's almost as if the author got tired after 448 pages and just wanted to finish the story ASAP. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll leave it at that except to reassure that the mystery itself is solved; it's the *resolution* that's lacking.I've been reading the Lord Peter Wimsey stories in chronological order (and would rate nearly all of them so far as 4+ Stars). That's a good thing, because if this book had been my first Wimsey book, I'm not sure I would have read any further."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"A puzzling murder where the time of death is crucial.

I have several of my favorite Sayers novels on audio, and the Petherbridge ones are my preference, despite their being abridged. David Case also does an excellent job on his narration of Whose Body. But I must add my support to the previous post which noted that Ian Carmichael can be difficult to follow. Carmichael does a decent Whimsey, but cannot bend his voice enough to create distinct characters beyond Whimsey. All too often I find myself backing up to replay episodes of conversation because I can't keep track of WHO is talking -- and this is despite having read the book! I cannot recommend the Carmichael readings to those unfamilar with the original works. Start with Petherbridge instead."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"In this, the second of the Vane/Wimsey novels, the story starts with Harriet Vane walking along the seaside and finding a corpse. Death by throat-cutting. Enter Lord Peter Wimsey. He and Harriet set out to solve the mystery of who killed the seaside corpse, with help from Bunter and the local police. Sayers excels at witty dialogue, of which there is plenty between Harriet and Peter, and at overly-complicated most-unlikely murder methods. This novel also contains a cipher, which Peter and Harriet decode. This is a good read for those who are already fans of Wimsey and Vane, but the story isn't as strong as \\"Strong Poison\\" or \\"Guady Night.\\""},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Dorothy Sayers was far ahead of her time when she wrote the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery novels in the late 1920's and early-to-mid 1930's.

Even her minor characters were three-dimensional and recognizable as \\"real\\" people. \\"Have His Carcase\\" is one of her best, with Lord Peter and Harriet Vane solving a fascinating mystery while carefully exploring, with the civilized delicacy of their time, their feelings for one another.

Like all of Dorothy L Sayers' books, it is highly intelligent and very well written. Sayers has an uncanny insight into human psychology and also has a wonderful way of characterizing her characters -- even minor characters come across as intriguing and realistic. Sayers clearly did a lot of research for all her novels, and the amount of detail she packs into the descriptions makes the places and persons all the more engaging and the reader's experience all the more rewarding.What sets this book apart from the rest, however, is that it is here that we see the relationship between Sayers' indomitable sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, and the young woman he saved from the gallows in Strong Poison, the amusing contrary Harriet Vane, develop and blossom into the first stages of a real love story. Although the focus is on the mystery, the Wimsey-Vane storyline is much more than a subplot. It runs through the novel and ultimately becomes just as important as the case they are working on. In Gaudy Night, one of Sayers' masterpieces in my opinion, the love story takes center stage and it is the mystery that becomes the backdrop for its unfolding.For those who prefer mysteries to romances, however, there is nothing overly sentimental or \\"romancy\\" in the unfolding of Wimsey's and Vane's relationship. What the relationship gives Sayers is an opportunity to really gaze deeper into aspects of human psychology, and her writing is spot on. Lord Peter especially becomes a much more human character as he struggles to build a fragile relationship with Harriet, whose bruised past makes her especially prickly and sensitive to his advances.I heartily recommend this book to all. If you get a chance to see the PBS/WGBH televised series, it is also a treat!"},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Dorothy Sayers had the gift of respecting all of her characters. Any one of them (including the villains) could be a member of your family. All were flawed with humanity. The mystery is always secondary to the individuals involved. This is a great read that gets better with each reading."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"The mysteries of Dorothy L. Sayers are intricate and intelligent, models of perfectly maddening puzzles that readers can barely solve. \\"Have His Carcase\\" is no exception, a fine round and round-about mystery that keeps readers (and the two detectives) searching till the final chapter.The story finds Harriet Vane, recently acquited of murder, on a walking vacation. Mystery has a way of following her, and she encounters a dead body on the beach. Was it suicide or murder? Knowing that the tide is about to come in, Harriet takes pictures and clues to preserve what she can, and searches out the local authorities. Lord Peter Wimsey, gentleman detective, comes to Harriet's aid and also delves into the crime, a case of murder with a baffling array of suspects and alibis. Every clue and every alibi makes a strong case for suicide, but Wimsey knows it to be a murder, if only he could prove it.\\"Have His Carcase\\" is a story with a lot on its plate; the wide cast of characters creates a web of further mystery and cluelessness around the death. This is all layered in with the flirtation between Wimsey and Vane, a delectable pairing of romance and comedy, as Harriet rebuffs Wimsey's marriage proposals at every turn. Sayers is perhaps almost too intelligent in her mysteries, giving her detectives almost unlimited knowledge on a wide range of topics. The chapters involving ciphers are particularly hard to decipher, but do little to distract from the excellent mystery at hand. And while the story does seem to go round and round, it comes full circle in the end."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Sayers once again delivers a solid, old-fashioned mystery story set in the English countryside. The body of a gigolo is discovered by Harriet Vane, who was recently rescued by Lord Peter from being wrongly convicted for murder. Vane is supposedly on vacation--on a walking tour to recover from her ordeal, but ends up investigating a murder instead. Lord Peter is madly in love with her but she does not return his affections.Vane discovers the bloody body on the beach as the tide is coming in. She rushes to town as quickly as possible to notify the police but is unable to do so before the body is swept away on the tides. Lord Peter comes to stay at the seaside resort to investigate the crime and continue his courtship. While working on the mystery together, Vane's feelings for Lord Peter vary from irritation to camaraderie to a reluctant affection.Lord Peter is a charming, intelligent sleuth who has met his intellectual match in Harriet Vane. This further installment of his adventures evokes the nostalgic atmosphere of an English seaside town during the early 1930's. It also provides an intricate murder mystery and the growing pains of a passionate relationship. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"Harriet Vane, well-known mystery writer, has decided to take a walking holiday along the English coast. She would like a bit of solitude to work on her latest novel and to recover from the unpleasantness of being tried for the murder of her former lover (STRONG POISON). She would also like to put some distance between her and Lord Peter Wimsey who had uncovered the true culprit and saved her from prison. Since this is a mystery novel by Sayers Harriet's plans quickly changed.She stopped for lunch and a short nap on the beach and woke to discover a dead body nearby. In this pre-cell phone age (1930's) reporting the crime to the police became a lengthy affair. Once the police became involved the press and Lord Peter were not far behing putting a decisive end to Harriet's quiet holiday. Soon Harriet and Peter found themselves embroiled in the world of resort life - middle-aged widows, professional dance partners, fishermen, farmers, 'kept' women and long-lost royalty. In the end of course the two triumph, solving the baffling crime.Lord Peter's infatuation with Harriet begun in STRONG POISON, has a chance to grow during this novel and is beginning to be returned by Harriet. The interactions between the two are well written and a treat for the Peter/Harriet romance fans without detracting from the mystery. As always with Sayers' work the secondary characters are well written and engaging, the plot intricately plotted and clever. Unfortunately Sayers goes into excrutiating detail at times, particularly concerning a rather complicated cipher - skim or skip that chapter.All in all this is an excellent story, a definite must read for Lord Peter fans, particularly those into the Peter and Harriet romance but this is not the place to begin start with one of the earliest Lord Peter stories or STRONG POISON to begin the Peter/Harriet romance."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"In terms of pure detection-ism, this is one of the author's best books featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, debonair aristocrat and talented amateur sleuth, in partnership with Harriet Vane, successful writer of mystery novels, whom Wimsey has been pursuing doggedly since saving her from the gallows. Harriet is taking a break from work by way of a walking tour along the southwest coast and by purest accident she discovers the body of a bearded young man with a profusely bleeding cut throat atop a large stone slab on the beach below the road. Being her, she whips out her camera and documents the scene, knowing the tide is coming in and that the body will be gone before she can summon help. She gathers up the razor that appears to be the instrument of destruction and then off she goes. She soon discovers the man was a professional dancer (ballroom-type) and gigolo at a nearby resort hotel, and that the police assume the victim must be a suicide. But he doesn't seem to have had any reason to do away with himself; in fact, he was about to marry a much older woman with lots of money. Then Wimsey turns up to lend a hand, whether she wants the assistance or not, and the two decide it must be a murder -- if only because that would suit them better.Some authors seem to concentrate on one or another of the three main ingredients of a good murder mystery -- plot, characters, and narrative style -- but Sayers is one of the few who was consistently top-drawer at all three. The plot this time quickly becomes highly complex with a relatively large number of key characters and numerous red herrings -- so much so that even our two detectives have to make up lists and charts to keep everything straight. It's a useful device for the reader, too, and there's also a delightful sequence involving the solving of a playfair cipher. At the same time, the characters are fully formed and fascinating -- and not only Peter and Harriet but Antoine, Inspector Umpelty, Mrs. Weldon, and the gold-digging Miss Leila Garland. But on top of all that, there's the author's quotation-laden dialogue, her use of subtle implication instead of bald description (it makes you pause and think again about what you've just read), and her gently sardonic jabs at British types and cultural assumptions. And the solution to the whole thing was not one I expected, even though it has (eighty years later) become something of a clich&eacute;. Sayers didn't write nearly enough books about Lord Peter Wimsey to satisfy me."},{"Title":"Have His Carcase","review":"My first encounter with Dorothy L.

The Resulting movie is \\"Haunted Honeymoon\\"(1940)Naturally the TV media cannot fill in all the details that you would pick up from reading the book.So I read the book. This added more depth to the story, now I appreciate Dorothy L. Sayers more than Agatha Christie. Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out better but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting. And just when you say what is the relevance to this conversation it is wrapped up in the final solution.This is the second of the book series. The story is complete and can be used as a stand-alone story. The notorious Harriet Vane is out for a walk and takes a nap. She wakes up and finds (you guest it) a body.

After walking six miles she called the police and the newspapers to report the existence of the dead body.Lord Peter arrived to meet Harriet at her hotel, much to her surprise. A journalist had rung him up, it seems. The dead man had been a professional dancing partner, a police inspector told Harriet and Peter. A Mrs. Weldon, friend of the deceased man, sought Harriet's company. She claimed she and the decedent were to be married.The murder weapon was an Endicott razor with an ivory handle. Wimsey learned from a Mr. Endicott that ivory-handled ones were in short supply. The notion that a bearded man had in his possession an old-fashioned razor of good quality presented a problem.When the body came to shore there was an inquest, and the investigation of shifting identities began.

There is nothing new; what's more, there is nothing edifying. It is also unclear through the course of the book whether Kodell supports the historicity of the Gospel accounts; this historicity is clearly affirmed in the Church's Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum), and one would hope a Catholic monk like Kodell would stick to Catholic positions. Also, Kodell does not seem to draw the distinction between what the Savior said (whether He spoke the institution narrative Himself or not) and the revealed Scriptures which transmit all that is needed for salvation. Finally, this book has a number of historical inaccuracies - for instance, pp. 48-9 incorrectly elaborate upon the \\"Todah\\" sacrifice (he apparently never read Leviticus 17).

Anybody could write a better book than this and almost anybody could illustrate it better."},{"Title":"Benny Hill: Merry Master of Mirth","review":"Ingrid Pitt has starred in Hammer Films as one of the most alluring vampires to ever glide across the screen! Who better to write a book on vampires and vampire movies? This is a highly entertaining book, full of humour, but that's not all---you can tell Ingrid has done a lot of thoughtful research. If you are an Ingrid Pitt fan, or you just want to enjoy a fun, intriguing take on vampires, real or on screen, you will want this book!"},{"Title":"Benny Hill: Merry Master of Mirth","review":"I'm really SURPRISED at my reaction to this book. I LOVE Benny Hill (I have some of his videos and watched his syndicated show for years). I am now a fulltime ventriloquist and read and collect books on comedians and comedy. I have re-read many of the comedy/comedian books in my collection. I could not WAIT until I got this book!But I found this book incredibly tedious.At first I thought it was due to the fact that I'm American and Americans haven't seen as much of Hill's work as his British audiences. But I've read bios of comedians that detail work they did that I never viewed and I loved those books. This is a book crammed with research, whether it's about his early years -- how his comedy style came together -- or his years as the King of British TV, then American syndicated TV...and his sad fall as a victim of the relentless armies of political correctness.The book reads like a collection of detailed research notes and staid business articles. There seems to be little passion (and when there seems to be passion it's a weird dispassionate passion!) for the subject, unlike the GREAT books done by authors on Laurel &amp; Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Chaplin, and most certainly, The Three Stooges. Those books make you want to go out and see more of their work, even if you don't like them. This book summarizes and informs -- and can bore a diehard fan.It's so very sad because Hill was so incredibly funny. As an American I didn't like many of his verbal skits -- and certainly NOT his songs -- but his silent segments bordered on comedic genius a la Ernie Kovaks or (I know some will be furious at this) Chaplin.This book is so clinical it took me a LONG TIME to finish it. I'm talking about MONTHS where I had to read other books to get back to and through it. Ross, who wrote a critically acclaimed book on Monty Python's Fying Circus, certainly did excellent research. There's a ton of info you can't get anywhere else -- inside information about each step of Hill's career and why he did what he did at pivotal times; who was in his corner, keeping him on t.v., and who didn't like him.But I can only recommend this to die-hard Hill fans who want every single thing available on him -- NOT to anyone seeking a book that tells about Hill and communicates the joy and (until the end)uncensored craziness of his comedy. Today his comedy lives on in video tape, despite the enemies that ended his career and, some say, finally broke his heart."},{"Title":"Benny Hill: Merry Master of Mirth","review":"Like one of the previous reviewers of this book, I was disappointed. I found it tedious and repetitious. It's a sad let down for fans of Benny. Key players in Hill's shows, like Jackie Wright were all but ignored. But if you must have everything about this beloved British comic, go for it."},{"Title":"Benny Hill: Merry Master of Mirth","review":"It is quite obvious after reading this book that Mr. Ross is a genuine fan of &quot;The lad himself&quot; from not only the depth of research but also the personal take that he puts on the book in the last few segments. The ONE thing that kept me from giving this book a 5 star rating is that, although he mentions co-stars such as Jack Wright, Sue Upton, Louise English, and Henry McGee, he neglects to put pictures of them in the book with Benny. For fans of the show they know who these people are but not so the occasional viewer who might buy the book hoping to find out a bit more about Benny and his show. Despite this, it's a great book and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"I have the 4 vol. in 1 book.When I first picked up this book I wasn't impressed at all but by the middle of the first book, I couldn't put it down, the writing is excellent, and there are so many unexpected twists that you can't wait to read what is going to happen.I really like the idea of where these characters evolved too, except Giles who I thought was great being evil. If they turned this book into an actual episode I would be totally psyched."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"She is forced to face her most difficult challenge - destroying her friend and mentor, Giles. She finds herself living in a 25 year old buffy body while her soul is still 19 here buffy faces the hardest challanges yet ..."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"The Lost Slayer: Original Sins is the final, and arguably, best installment of the 4 part series. Author Christopher Golden took his time in crafting a story that is suspensful, exciting, and at-times heart-wrenching!This book explores Buffy's strength. She is forced to face her most difficult challenge - destroying her friend and mentor, Giles. The events leading up to the climatic battle are intense and very exciting! Though Buffy is 25-years-old for the bulk of the book, her 19-year-old soul is still entwined and experiencing everything. It allows her to be a little bit wiser when she ultimately has to relive the horrifying events that lead to Giles' capture and death. The final scenes are well-written and the mental image that is painted is so intense it's like watching the show. The final few paragraphs are very heart-warming. While the series as a whole is quite horrifying, the ending is a touch lighter.Golden did a splendid job portraying the characters future selves. Willow is a remarkable sorcoress who still maintains the spirit of a shy girl who excites easily. Xander is a stoic play-by-the-book military man who has lost everything and is now fighting to survive. Oz is still quiet and emotionless, only now he has the ability to control his animal instincts. Buffy is a girl who has seen a lot, both as a 25-year-old and a 19-year-old, and it's left her tough as nails, but still with a slight Slayer's edge. The characters continue to grow and develope even in the future Sunnydale. They remain as interesting as ever!The return of characters such as Angel, Wesley, and Lucy Hanover shows there there is continuity among the books like there is in the show. New characters such as the priest who has a sixth sense to tell where vampires are hiding, and Anna - the slayer the preceeds Faith, give the book a unique flavor that the show often doesn't have.The entire series was fantastic! A truly enjoyable read. The books are all less than 200 pages and all make for a nice 3 hour read. While they are classified as &quot;young adult&quot;, the story can be enjoyed by Buffy fans of all ages. Treat yourself and check them out!"},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"Those that have been following along know that the previous episode of this series (&quot;King of the Dead&quot;) ended with Buffy in hot pursuit of Rupert Giles through the cellars of Sunnydale's City Hall. Giles, turned into a vampire by the Bat God Camazotz has become a master vampire. Under his control the blood drinkers of Southern California are preparing to take over a sizable chunk of the Southwest. For Buffy, suddenly thrust forward into this time to share her own body with her five years older self, this is a confrontation she absolutely cannot afford to lose. But it is one she will hate to win.I'm not going to play at maintaining suspense by not quite telling you she is going to win this battle. Win she does, but at tremendous cost in energy and lives. And Buffy quickly discovers that this is to be only the first of many struggles. The future she is in came about as the result of an error she made five years back. She must find out what her mistake was and undo it if there is to be any way of unmaking the horror and returning a better future to the world. Buffy and Willow combine efforts to discover the error and to find a way for Buffy to return. Buffy's trials are hardly over, and if the final end is not in doubt, it still offers a titanic and moving end that is much different than from Buffy's usual tales.Right away the reader will sense that there is more to this story than being yet another Buffy tale. The characters are vivid, sharply drawn by Christopher Golden's. Willow is stronger, Xander is etched by loss and struggle, and Buffy, after 5 years locked in a cell, is tougher and more determined than ever before. As events force Buffy into self examination and new understandings she provides more than just her usual woman-in-charge role model. She demonstrates deeper values of friendship and commitment that make this a great story for all ages.Golden has very much outdone himself this time. The pace of action, which builds constantly over the four episodes, never seems to flag. He has found new ways to use and work with all his characters and maintained a steady stream of surprises and inventions. My only regret is that this was published in four parts rather than as a single 500 page offering. Thus the price a bit higher than it need be, although I would not have quibbled at the price even if the publishers had chosen to issue this as a hard cover. At least then I wouldn't have had to way three months for the conclusion. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"Actually, &quot;Original Sins,&quot; Part Four in Christopher Golden's &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; serial novel, offers not one, but two conclusions. In the future, Buffy and what remains of the Scooby Gang have their final showdown with Rupert Giles the Vampire King and &quot;returns&quot; to the present to correct the fatal error from her first encounter with Camazotz. With all the excitement about Giles becoming the king of the Vampires, it is easy to forget that Camazotz is an excellent villain to appropriate into the Buffy mythos and I think Golden deserves extra credit for coming up with two first-rate bad guys in the same storyline.Actually, I almost wish Golden had not put the two great villains in the same book, because I would have loved to have seen Camazotz and his estranged &quot;wife&quot; Zotzilaha, be more center stage, but obviously he is not going to be able to compete with Giles as the Vampire King. Actually, &quot;Popol Vuh,&quot; one of the Mayan sacred books, identifies Zotzilaha not as a god, but as a cavern, &quot;The House of Bats.&quot; Zotzilaha was home to a type of bat called Camazotz, which has been translated as &quot;snatch bat&quot; and &quot;death bat.&quot; Camalotz was also the name of the &quot;Sudden Bloodletter&quot;, identified as one of four animal demons which slew the impious first race of men. We all know much more about the European vampire legends than what happened in South America, but Golden has taped a rich vein of lore and maybe in the future Buffy will encounter the religious death cult of the Zapotecs that worshipped a bat-demon, or the soucouyant of Trinidad or the tin tin of Ecuador.Who says Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not educational?&quot;Original Sins&quot; is an appropriate title for this concluding volume, which certain comes full circle given that at the start of the story Buffy is trying to separate her life as the Slayer from her life as a college Freshman. In dividing that world she thinks that her friends belong with the later, which is somewhat surprising since I always thought one of the reasons Buffy has lasted so long as a Slayer is because she was not going it alone. You would think the Watchers Council would have figured out somewhere along the line that a Slayer with support in the field was going to last longer than one forced to go solo.The entire &quot;Lost Slayer&quot; series clearly takes advantage of the fact that it was written during Season 5 but takes place in Season 3. Golden clearly knows how far Willow has advanced in her wicca ways and he uses that to his advantage. I have always thought that it was the relationship between Buffy and Willow that is really at the heart of the show, and both Season 6 and Golden's novels prove the point as far as I am concerned. For those who enjoyed &quot;The Wish&quot; and &quot;Doppelgangland&quot; or have always enjoyed the DC comic &quot;What If...&quot; issues or &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and its various homages, &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is a fitting addition to the oeuvre. When these sort of stories are done right they are so good. &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is on the same level as &quot;The Gatekeeper Trilogy,&quot; and that, in the wonderful world of Buffy the Vampire Slayer books, is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"19 year old buffy's spirit is stuck in her 24 year old body. giles her trusted mentor is king of the vampires. her mother hasbeen brutally murdered along with faith. angel is missing andpresumed dead. all this is because of one mistake buffy made in the past. now she must not only find a way to restore her 19 year old soul to it's proper time but also how to kill giles andhopefully find angel. a very daunting prospect for the slayer.this final addition to the four part drama answers most of thequestions with finese that only christopher golden can. this oneis not as good as the first 2 but it is definiely worth the read.i know most fans wants to know how buffy will get her real lifeback and i don't think you will be disappointed. i cannot tellyou much more without giving away the answers to all yourquestions but to tell you to go out and read this final addition."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"The stunning conclusion of the 4 part book can be considered the best of all four. Christopher Golden continues to show what a imagination he has. The book continues from where it left off. Giles is missing and Buffy finds her lover Angel. When Buffy went missing Angel went looking for her and was captured. The fait he awaits is more pain that Buffy can handle. Buffy finally finds Giles.The book is so compelling. I actually felt a tug at my heartsrings when Xander met his dire demise. And when Wesley was dramitically killed. Buffy fights with Giles in a well described scene and Buffy wins. The book is both adventerous and thrilling and at the same time stunning. Buffy manages to return to her past but she must find a way to change what happened in Prophesies.I think this is the best book out of the four because it shows that Sunnydale has really gone to hell and Buffy must go back to stop this horrible future so she can be with her friends and everyone she loved will not be gone. Like her mother.The conclusion was well done. Christopher Golden did a fantastic job on the whole series of books. If you want to settle down and read a really good book about the Scoobies, fun times, bad times and very sad times then you have to read this book along with the first 3 parts."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"Well, I have to say that out of all the novelisations based on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Christopher Golden's &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; has *not* been by favourite. Beginning with 'Prophesies', and moving through 'Dark Times' and 'The Vampire King' Golden gives himself the freedom to do what he likes with the characters (including killing them) by instigating a plot device that has nineteen year old Buffy hurtled into the future to her twenty-five year old body, fighting in an post-apocalyptic Sunnydale ruled over by Giles, the Vampire King. All this is due to a fatal mistake she made in her college years, and the course of 'Original Sins' can be divided into two: Buffy going up against Giles, and Buffy attempting to rectify her long-ago mistake.Also on the scene are her former friends - the powerful sorceress Willow (who plays the largest part in the story after Buffy herself), the hardened warrior Xander, and the werewolf Oz hovering between humanity and animalistic tendencies. Along with the Watcher's Council and the latest Slayer Anna Keui (who doesn't play any sort of meaningful part in the action) they go up against Giles and the demon-god Camazotz, previously a dangerous foe, now just a battery for the Kakchiquels (vampires that fed on his mystical energy). Despite a rather potent scene that has Buffy fighting between what Golden describes as &quot;the two men she loved most&quot; - the vampiric Giles and a trapped Angel, the final showdown with her former Watcher is somewhat anti-climatic, and all that follows with Willow and former-Slayer Lucy Hanover sending Buffy back into the past has absolutely no edge to it, simply because everybody *knows* that things will get back to normal. Such is the problem with writing a book set in an already-established plot line - you can't develop anybody or anything.&quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; was a vaugely entertaining read, but after volume one, there was no way you could read them out of order without becoming utterly lost. I suggest the publication that has all four books in one volume so that one doesn't have to hunt all over the place for the next installment in the series (one of the things I hate about any kind of book that isn't self-contained). There's an interesting look in the future of what *could* one day happen, but nothing we haven't seen in episodes in television such as &quot;The Wish&quot; in Season Three, and eventually Golden's killing off of practically every character for no other reason but simply because he *could* got tiring. By the end, I was skim reading in order to get to the finish. By all means, give it a try, but don't feel bad if you have to return it to the library before you're done."},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"The world is changing. At least inside the walls of the town of Sunnydale, California. Spike is dead, as are Faith, the slayer gone bad, and Joyce Summers, Buffy's beloved mother. All is not right due to the fact that Southern California is now being ruled by vampires. And Rupert Giles himself, is the king of them all. Buffy knows that all that is happening in the future was caused by her. The fact that she didn't want help from her friends in fighting the vampires, and Camazotz led to Giles' capture, and ultimately pushed him to become the King of Vampires. Now, Buffy must gather all of the strength that she has, and fight the demon that is inhabiting Giles' body to alter the future. Now, with the help of Willow, and the rest of the Scooby Gang, Buffy must kill Camazotz, save Giles, and bring her body back to her old self before it's too late.I have been closely following Christopher Golden's LOST SLAYER QUARTET, due solely to the fact that I adore his writing, and I have not been at all disappointed in any of the volumes, especially ORIGINAL SINS. In this fourth and final installment readers are treated to numerous battle scenes, and Buffy's old sarcastic wit, that has made, and kept, all of us such big fans. ORIGINAL SINS is an absolute must-read for anyone who has read the previous three novels in THE LOST SLAYER QUARTET.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Original Sins","review":"Caution: Spoilers abound if you haven't read the first 3 books in this series.The final showdown with Giles, King of the Vampires is at hand. However, even if they beat him, the price will be high.

Fortunately she doesn't figure much in the tale. Besides that, the action is well-rendered (I had much less trouble visualizing the scenes than I did in the last couple volumes in the series), and the story itself is very compelling.

Part Four was a tad depressing and simply put, the \\"Thrall\\" was gone. It became predictable and not in that \\"Buffy will save the day\\" way.The novel did cement the bond Willow and Buffy's friendship. It's nice to know that Willow often thought of Buffy as a sister and her belief in Buffy never wavered, even in the dismal future. The death of main characters had some emotional impact.

The story is never dull, and the hideous and hypnotic bat-winged Mayars make for memorable villains. The depiction of a human sacrifice to these monsters halfway through the novel is particularly unforgettable. There is also a multifarious array of attacking prehistoric monsters, without the claustrophobic feel of the 1970's film.Also recommended is Basil Copper's treatment of the descent-into-the-earth theme in his creepy novel The Great White Space, now unfortunately out of print."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"...so one day independently wealthy David Ennis is confronted by his scientist buddy Abner Peery who has just invented a vehicle that essentially drills through the earth. (If the reader is into descriptives it looks like the device Dr Evil of Austin Powers fame has devised to take over the world.) They decide, \\"Well, let's try it out.\\" and the reader is then treated to a journey to middle earth which is similar to Jules Verne's, but not as serious. I would say that Burroughs brings us satire similar to Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" or Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travel\\". The inner world, Pellicidar, is one where if you are not careful, you can be awake for days because the sun never sets or rises--that sun being the molten earth core rather than the sun we all know of. In Pellucidar, the various dragons, apes, and reptiles and mutations of such, are heads of gangs, tribes and kingdoms in the middle earth. And the royalty has beautiful sorcery princesses like Dian the Beautiful, who David falls for and who leads him into an innerworld adventure taking the reader to an unforgettable serial-pulp style reading enjoyment. If you dig Robert E. Howard or Jules Verne or Rice Burroughs' Tarzan series you will definitely love this.

I loved it and the book helped me develop a life long love of reading. I also have read all his John Carter of Mars series... 5 stars... see my reviews.In 1917 the world was in trouble with one more year of WW1 to go and millions dieing of the flu epidemic. ERB creator of Tarzan of the Apes wanted to entertain people and allow them to escape some of their daily problems. He became a master writer and wrote The John Carter of Mars series, a Tarzan series, an inner world Pellucidar series and a Venus series and more!At The Earth's Core is the beginning of the inner world Pellucidar series introducing the main character David Innes. David Innes and an older man named Perry, an inventor of a gigantic metal Earth borer machine, test the huge machine boring into the earth. The controls jam and they are transported well over 500 miles deep into the Earth. They arrive in a fantastic Prehistoric world named Pellucidar.David and Perry battle many different Prehistoric monsters and different races of cave men, ape men, and the leading intelligent savage race of reptilian Mahar beings that eat human flesh from fattened up captured slaves. We see the savagery and killing. David meets a beautiful cave women princess named Dian The Beautiful. He punches out her unwanted suitor but does not know her people's customs. He does not claim her as a mate and she is made to feel she is David's slave. She says she hates him even when he rescues her from certain death. Later they make up and are lovers.David and Perry are captured and are made slaves of the reptilian Mahar beings. The reptilian queen and her court are seen gorging on captured fattened up human slaves. All the reptilians are female and a secret complicated chemical is used to allow reproduction and continuance of their species. There is only one book with the chemical formula and David steals it. He comes back to save Perry. David becomes the first Emperor of Pellucidar right before a gigantic battle between the reptilian beings and the other races for dominance of Pellucidar.I won't ruin this action packed story for you. There is a great ending! ERB was great with making an entire underground inner Earth Prehistoric world with fantastic scenery description, Prehistoric monsters, different cave men races, ape races, and the leader intelligent reptilian race. What an imagination. This book is an easy read. I read the 178 page book leisurely in less than 8 hours. Its a page burner, the reader wants to read on. So interesting and exciting with lots of action.This book is great for a Jr. high School reader and up. The youngsters may need help with some of the Prehistoric monsters scientific names but 99.99% of the book is an easy read. A good book to add to a youngsters love of reading. Rated 4 1/3 stars and proudly added to our family library. ERB INMO was a master writer. Bought another of the Pellucidar series to read and add to our family library."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"After starting his Barsoom and Tarzan series of adventures, Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950), wrote \\"At the Earth's Core\\" which was published in 1914. This kicked off his Pellucidar series, which is based on the idea that the Earth is hollow and there are creatures from our prehistoric times still alive and active, as well as more than a few horrific creatures, both intelligent and non-intelligent. As with many of Burrough's ideas, that of a hollow Earth would inspire many other writers to write stories on a similar theme.There are many similarities between this and Burrough's Barsoom series, and as such it is fairly predictable, but there are some differences as well. Once again there is an introduction which makes the case that this is a real story. Instead of an unexplained transportation to Mars, the journey to Pellucidar is done via an invention, a \\"subterranean prospector\\" which works far better and also far worse than intended. The hero, David Innes and his friend Perry who invented the \\"subterranean prospector\\" find themselves in a hostile world; they are captured and captured again finding themselves enslaved by the dominant species of the planet, the Mahars. The hero also finds a beautiful woman who he is destined to be with.This novel isn't nearly as good as the start to the Pellucidar series as \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was for the Barsoom series. There are some rather racist descriptions, and the language difficulties are overcome too easily, though one has to also give credit for the Mahars as a unique and horrible species, though there again they have an Achilles heel which is rather absurd. Another weakness is the flow of time, which sometimes results in contradictions in the plot. It is never quite clear just how Burrough's saw this working, so while one can appreciate the attempt, the execution of the idea isn't very well done.As one has come to expect from Burrough's, the adventure is entertaining, the characters are a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is fairly predictable. Thus, if one is looking for an entertaining mindless escape, this may work to fill that goal, but then again one would be better served by reading the Barsoom series which is much better done. There are crossovers between the Barsoom series and this one, as well as between the Tarzan series and this one, which makes it of interest as well."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"At The Earth's Core is the first installment of Edgar Rice Burrough's Pellucidar series, about a hidden world at the center of our planet.

I had already read much of the Tarzan series in my younger days, and have recently read the John Carter on Mars series.This series also follows the same formula that worked so well in the previous series. This is not great literature, but pure action and adventure, with romance thrown in. The author does a good job describing this inner world of Pellucidar, and picking up the weird landscapes and perspectives that would occur. I'm amazed at Burroughs imagination, and the fantastic creatures and races he comes up with.The reader was Patrick Lawlor, and he did a good job with the characterizations. We listened to this on a road trip, and it made the time pass very quickly. My son really enjoyed it also. I highly recommend this audio book."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"It amazes me how Burroughs could change the scenes of his stories in so many ways, without changing the story itself.This time, the mysterious and unexplored land is the inner surface of a hollow Earth. David Innes reaches it via an ill-explained \\"prospector,\\" created in secret by super-scientist Perry. This digging machine is to soil what a submarine is to water, so off they go on the first trial of the machine and its super-motor. They go way off, farther than they ever imagined.Pellucidar, that planet-within-a-planet, hosts Innes's adventure for the next decade. Its nightless sky illuminates a world apparently undergoing the same evolution seen on the surface, nearly in lock-step, but with eras crossing each other in merry abandon. That gives plenty of time for bronto-riding cavemen, hulking and hirsuit half-men, pterodactyls, and fiendishly intelligent dinosaurians - the anthropophagi obligatory in a tale of this type. And, as is the ERBish habit, there's a damsel in distress, a baffling romance thwarted by chivalric misunderstandings, and the sneaking traitor, kept close at hand for those frequent moments when a dramatic act of treachery needed to take the place of logical progression. And yes, the super-scientific explorers end up fighting with swords.If this were a movie, it would call out for a rainy Saturday and a bucket of popcorn. If you just want a swashbuckler, long on derring-do and short on reasons for doing it, you've come to the right place.

Thus the two men wind up... At The Earth's Core!They are no sooner in this strange land than they incounter megatheria, ape-men with prehensile tales, ape-men without tales, intelligent pterosaurs, cavemen whose favorite greeting is \\"I kill!\\" and the lovely Dian (a wonderful cavegirl with a rather ordinary name). Can they escape with their lives, save Dian, and free the human race from the heartless reptilian overlords?There are some continuity errors (blame it on the weird timelessness?) and I think the next book in the series is better, but this one is good. Well worth reading, and I've bought it, loaned it, didn't get it back, and gotten it for Christmas."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"There have been a number of well written citiques of scientific blunders in the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs. David Langford (1982) makes a convincing case that the notion of a hollow Earth had long been discredited by scientists when Burroughs published the first Pellucidar novel in 1914. Nor does Burroughs seem to have followed any single pseudo-scientific scenario very closely. His \\"research\\" was probably limited to a few newspaper and popular magazine articles.But in _The Trillion Year Spree_ (1986), Brian W. Aldiss argues that such scientific criticism is not relevant in an an evaluation of the settings of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Burroughs \\"is not interested in the facts of the external world\\" (163). Rather, he is \\"reporting from his own internal Pellucidar. Burroughs's Mars, like Ray Bradbury's later Mars, reports on areas which cannot be scrutinized through any telescope\\" (163). Burroughs \\"wants us to identify, to sink into his dream countries and exclude the outside one\\" (165).Well, then. What are the basic characteristics of this internal Pellucidar? It is a retreat to the primitive. Mars, Pellucidar, Venus, and Africa are all low-tech worlds. It is a rejection of urban culture, something of a protest against the rising urbanization and population growth of the time. It was conservative, offering mythic extensions of the Americain west at precisely the same time that the Old West was closing off. And it was anti-intellectual and somewhat irrational in nature. Burroughs frequently praised the common sense of soldiers, fighting men and \\"common people\\" and satirized the follies of scientists. (In _At the Earth's Core_, the inventor Abner Perry is portrayed as loveable but foolish.)This anti-intellectualism may be seen in Burroughs's treatment of the concepts of space and time in _At the Earth's Core_. Space is distorted in several of Burroughs's settings, but certainly the most spectacular example is the horizonless world of Pellucidar. Here is David Innes's first view of it:As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was _looking up_ at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom-- the distance was lost in the distance. (20)While Pellucidar is actually limited in size, it does not _appear_ to be limited. One of the effects of a horizonless world is that it has no visible boundaries. The sense of disorientation that characters feel in this world gives the reader a sense that it is virtually unmappable. Finally, Burroughs uses a simple but effective trick with Pellucidar to make it appear bigger: He makes Pellucidar three quarters land and one quarter water. Thus, while the total area of Pellucidar is really smaller than the surface area of Earth, the total _land_ area is greater. The reader is convinced that there is in fact an almost unending frontier inside the Earth.In Pellucidar, time is also distorted (as it is in other Burroughs settings as well). In Pellucidar, the sun at the center of the Earth keeps Pellucidar in perpetual daylight. Since there are no cycles of night and day, Burroughs claims that this results in a world of variable time. (This is sort of like arguing that if the clocks have stopped in your house, so has the passage of time.) Two characters may separate and then rejoin one another. For one character, months may have passed, while for another only hours have passed. Yet Burroughs does not simply claim that time is relative in Pellucidar. He has Innes assert that it is nonexistant. \\"How may one measure time,\\" he asks, \\"where time does not exist!\\" (39)Why these treatments of time and space? First, I think it is to satirize the rationalism of those egghead scientists. See how ridiculous their theories really are! Second, I believe that it is a bit of a revolt against the Protestant work ethic and factory schedules. But mostly,I think it is to create a world in which heroes and heroines can remain perpetually young, vigorous, and attractive. The new frontier of Burroughs is a kind of perpetual preadolescent state.Aldiss's attack on scientific critiques of Burroughs has some justification. Surely it is not terribly important at this late date to demonstrate that his work was full of scientific errors. But it _does_ seem reasonable to ask questions regarding Burroughs's logic in the development of his setting. He was reasonably effective in playing tricks with the reader's sense of space. But he was content to use only a few rhetorical tricks in order to suspend the laws of time. His treatment of time must be considered a weakness in his setting."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"Having already created two highly memorable science fiction heroes in Tarzan and John Carter, Edgar Rice Burroughs begins his third major series with David Innes. With friend Abner Perry, they dive their &quot;mole&quot;, or burroughing machine, straight through the earth's surface where they discover the savage land of Pellucidar. Here, where dinosaurs still exist and mankind is enslaved by the reptilian Mahars, David and his friend are forced to face unknown perils and survive in a hostile environment (and of course, win the beautiful lady).&quot;At the Earth's Core&quot; is another highly entertaining science fiction novel from ERB. Even though his format is formulaic, you're always assured of fast paced adventure in his novels.

This being Burroughs, the young man naturally meets a beautiful cave girl and falls in love. It's an entertaining read, especially if you like pulp fiction."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs made a living creating far flung worlds inhabited by savage beasts, savage races, lovely damsels, muscular heroes, and brute villains. He refined this template in his vast repetoire of novels that spanned Africa, Pellucidar, Mars, Venus, the moon, and other equally exotic locales. In AT THE EARTH'S CORE, ERB began what was the first in a series of inner earth novels. I read ATEC in this Ace pocket edition. The cover illustration wonderfully captured the sense of exoticism contained within. To understand this novel, as well as anything else ERB wrote, one must grasp his sense of how human beings were created, why they were created, and when their inner core values could be revealed. At the time he wrote, the early 20th century, the controversy between the superiority of nature or nurture was swinging in favor of the former. Genetics reigned supreme. Environment was understood to be no more than a modification of what was irrevocably set in stone in one's DNA. ERB's heroes are invariably described in genetic superlatives: handsome, well-built, co-ordinated, and lithe. He rarely mentioned their mental development. The villains were the polar opposites: beastly, with sloping foreheads, and often communicated in grunts. Tarzan was ERB's foremost hero. In AT THE EARTH'S CORE, his hero is David Innes, one who is more modern than Tarzan but nevertheless possessed of inhuman strength wedded to intelligence and morality. It was not often that ERB wrote of a hero with such \\"normal\\" traits.When one reads this book, one is often reminded that scientific accuracy was not a strong point of the author. Even when this book was published, it was pretty much settled that the earth's core was a mixture of solid rock and molten magma. But such knowledge never stopped him from spinning a good tale. Innes and his elder friend Abner Perry use a pointy earth drilling machine to plow straight down literally to the core of the earth. It is there that they find a world of beasts, proto-humans, humans, and reptillian sentients all struggling for supremacy in a land where time seems never to pass. Since there is no sun and light emanates from radioactivity in the surrounding rocks, time becomes frozen and hence a non-factor. ATEC is a standard tale of a daring man fighting for the heart and hand of a lovely woman, all the while a corking villain seeks to claim her in a manner that is brutish by our standards but quite normal by his. What makes this book work is ERB's uncanny ability to present strong characters amidst exotic locales. We become so entranced by the irresistable forward flow of the plot that we scarce notice the elephantine logical flaws and flubs that are uibiquitous. For those who like Tarzan and those like him, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is an engrossing read for anyone under seventeen. After that age, science kicks in the reader's mind but the memories of a far flung world remain even decades later."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"For Edgar Rice Burroughs, life was relatively simple. Men fell into one of three categories: muscular heroes, ordinary types, and evil, greasy villains. Women existed primarily to act as universal lighting rods that attracted either the first or third category. Regardless of the universe that ERB wrote of, these constants held with predictable regularity. With the publication of AT THE EARTH'S CORE, he began yet another series that put the hero at odds with nature, evil doers, and beautiful, virtuous women. David Innes, the handsome hero, drills down to the center of the earth in a manner that brings to mind Jules Verne's tale, both of which posit a habitable, temperate core that supports a variety of lush, prehistoric life. Despite knowing that the earth's core was held to be molten, ERB did not hesitate to bend science for the sake of a good tale. ATEC possesses both the plusses of ERB at his best and the negatives at his worst. Like Tarzan, Innes is a likable, manly sort who feels at home regardless of whether home is a jungle or a tea room. The logic of how ERB gets his hero placed in an exotic locale is irrelevant and often purely unscientific. For his Martian (Barsoom) series, he merely had his hero, John Carter, gaze at the Red Planet to effect his transport there. For his inner world series (Pellucidar), Innes used a drill machine, a device that at least tries to be scientific. Once there, Innes has the necessary adventures with beasts, villains, and beautiful women, in this case Dian the Beautiful. The workings of the plot about how he finds her, loses her, and then finds her again are almost not to the point. Where ERB excels in his ability to place the reader, who is usually a 15 year old boy, in a realm that allows imagination to run riot. Events flow so smoothly that the youthful reader will probably overlook the negatives of ERB's prose style. In the world of ERB's muscular heroes, both hero and villain speak in the artificial, courtly dialogue that rings true only to the ears of the young. Coincidence runs rife to the point of ridicule. Beautiful women are haughty at first, but lusty later, and then only to the clean-limbed hero. His plots are often mirror images of one another. You can substitute the center of the earth for Mars, Venus, Africa, or wherever, and hero, villain, and lovely lady are interchangeable. Yet, despite all this, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is the kind of read that ought to be part of any kid's early mental universe. Reading Burroughs as a thirty year old requires a strong ability to suspend one's disbelief, but once having done so, the ride is usually worth the effort."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your \\"helpful\\" vote is greatly appreciated.

This edition of \\"At the Earth's Core,\\" a Tarzan-like adventure at the center of the earth, is remarkable for its wonderful cover, by Roy Krenkel, Jr.Ah, what a world Burroughs created and beautifully illustrated by Krenkel.

The narrator is young David Innes, who joins Professor Abner Perry in test driving a mechanical prospector drill that develops steering problems and takes the duo down, down, deep into the earth. Just about as they think they are about to die they pass through the earth's crust and into the core world of Pellucidar.The world is inhabited by sloth-like \\"Dyryths\\" and the Sagoths, agile man-apes with tails. Captured by these latter creatures, Innes and Perry are taken before the Mahars, a race of sentient flying dinosaurs, what Abener identifies as \\"A rhamphorhynchus of the Middle Olitic.\\" The Mahars are the overlords of Pellucidar, enslaving the Mezops, the human-like inhabitants of the inner world. Innes wants to bring the Mahars' reign of terror to an end, but he has another problem, to wit, a love triangle with Dian the Beautiful and Jubal the Ugly. At least the characters in Edgar Rice Burroughs novels pick up primitive and/or other wordly languages within the span of a chapter.There is something nostalgic about these old ERB novels with their standard opening where the narrator asks us to treat the unbelievable story we are about to hear as true. \\"At the Earth's Core\\" was originally published in \\"All-Story\\" magazine from April 4 to April 25, 1914. It was ERB's tenth published novel at a point where he had written the first two Tarzan novels and the first three Mars books. The Pellucidar series was probably his third best series, coming ahead of the Carson of Venus books. The trade off here is that the adventure is fun but the dialogue wears thin quickly (how many times can the native of Pellucidar comment on our hero's ignorance of the ways of the inner world). Besides, David and Dian are are a second rate John Carter and Dejah Thoris (i.e., do not do the Pellucidar novels until you have enjoyed the Mars series).This is one of the few non-Tarzan novels that made it to the big screen, albeit with some of the worst fake dinosaurs for the Mahars you have ever seen in a movie. But what matters is that the book is better, so stick with it. Besides, there are more adventures for David and Abner in the rest of the series and their friendship proves to be a lot more interesting than the romantic relationship between David and Dian."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"There are some books you read for a skewed yet realistic depiction of the world we live in, and there are some books that you read for the pure adrenaline rush of reading them. This is a book about a world that exists at the center of the earth. It is not about science.Even given the state of science in 1914, when this book was first published (or serialized, depending on how technical you want to be), certain things were known, one of them being that if you drilled straight down into the planet, you would not find dinosaurs. But it's still a cool idea, tapping into that desire for a hidden world to exist just outside the one we know where things are way more interesting, that miles and miles below our feet lies a whole existence that is just as ignorant of us as we are of them. Imagine \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" but with all the thoughtful and calm narration replaced with action scenes and a rather breathless pace and you will find something remarkably similar to this novel. There's very little attempt made at even achieving a state of science, bordering on the patently ridiculous at times, but I will give him that the idea of building a giant drilling machine that accidentally takes them to a world at the center of the world is a far more believable notion that how John Carter gets to Mars, which is basically \\"Er, don't think about it, its magic!\\"But as with most Burroughs novels of the time, science tends to be put aside so we can get the characters to where the action is, namely Pellucidar. David Innes and elderly buddy Perry find themselves in a strange world lit by a sun that never sets and populated by a third-grader's version of ecology, which boils down to \\"all the awesome stuff in one place\\". Rather quickly they are divested of their clothes and left to their own devices in a land consisting of weird dinosaurs and the ever-present \\"noble savages\\". Before long, David manages to claim a woman and screw up local traditions before having to roam around the land trying to get back to his friend and find the woman, all the while attempting to rock a loincloth and blowing the natives' minds with such things as bows and arrows. And being its a Burroughs novel, of course it all leads to a rather quickly dashed off slave revolt resulting in big battles and romance and . . . a cliffhanger? Say it ain't so!This is not a novel you want to stop and think about as thinking ruins the entire experience. Its actually one of the few serialized experiences that reads better in one large chunk because reading it quickly allows you to wallpaper over the fact that much of this is improbable. The way to read it is like a rock skipping over the surface of a shiny lake, so that it all passes with magnificent brightness while not allowing you to notice the rocks and gunk underneath. Burroughs style lends itself to that, allowing you to be immersed in pure action and buff people trying to stab each other while not worrying about niggling things like logic and nuance. They're not so important anyway, so relax. Coincidence plays a huge role in just about everything (Innes loses the woman he has decided is the love of his life (after having only met her once and ticked her off, natch, although she is described as beautiful which in the early 20th century probably passed as an okay enough reason for anything) and spends a good portion of the novel looking for her before finally stumbling upon her almost by accident, fortunately she's okay with being in love with a weird in a loincloth she's just met) so give those eye rolling muscles a rest before you read it or else you'll pull something.But as villains the Mahars are an interesting idea even if precious little is done with them and they don't seem as smart as they should be (given they are extremely telepathic lizards, you think they would pick up on a bunch of guys parading around in discarded lizard skins as a disguise). However, their mental powers give rise to the creepiest scene in the book and I almost wish more could have been done with them. The rest of the inhabitants of Pellucidar seem assembled from a variety of ideas that Burroughs thought cool at the time, without the slightest regard to how it would all fit together and the world seems tailor made for Burroughs characters to come in and start causing trouble, like its been waiting for them all this time.So yeah, it has its problems and on some level you have to keep telling yourself \\"This was written a hundred years ago\\", but like most of the good, classic pulp stories, it satisfies on some visceral level. Too solid to exist as a dream, but too dream-like to feel like a real place, it appeals to a part of us that exists on pure imagination, before all the pesky science stuff got in the way, when it was okay to stare at a deep hole in the ground or under a sidewalk and think you felt the rumble of giant footsteps so far below, that you could only reach if you just dug far enough."},{"Title":"At the Earth's Core (Pellucidar)","review":"I read this book for one of my book reports and I was spellbound the moment that the dinosaurs and creatures rolled in.

This collection is focused mostly on his 60's and 70's work."},{"Title":"Hemut Newton: Pages from the Glossies","review":"Before discussing this book, let me caution readers that the book contains many examples of female nudes, a number of which are in overt sexual situations. This book would be at least &quot;R&quot; rated if it were a movie. Treat it accordingly. I saw nothing that was not in good taste, but people who wish to avoid such images should be forewarned. When originally published, some of these images were considered quite controversial.The strength of this book is Helmut Newton's outstanding fashion photography. The weakness is that it is displayed in facsimiles from the magazines rather than as a collection of perfectly reproduced photographs. This approach allows you to see how the photographs work with the layouts and designs. Also, the poses and compositions (both strengths of Newton's) are very clear for your consideration. The actual images themselves are often reproduced very poorly, however, sometimes looking like something that came off of a bad copier.Unlike many of the great photographers of the 20th century who saw themselves as artists first, Newton saw himself as existing primarily through publications. &quot;I realized very early on that the most important factor would be to be published, with a by-line . . . .&quot; This made him see the artistic life of his work as secondary. &quot;If any of these photographs end up on gallery or museum walls or in the possession of collectors, well all the better . . . .&quot; Think of him as the exact opposite of Ansel Adams in how he wants his work to be expressed and remembered.This book contains more than 500 pages of color, and black and white images from over 3000 that Newton published through 1998. The examples come mostly from French Vogue (beginning in 1961), Queen, Jardin des Modes, British Vogue, Elle, Daily Telegraph Magazine, American Vogue, Nova, Marie Claire, Deutsche Vogue, Amica, Vanity Fair, Paris Match, Allure, and Stern. Most of the examples are from the 1960s and the 1970s.Mr. Newton's style is very lively. His models have strong personalities, and usually dominate the scene. They are also active, creating an excitement that draws attention to them. For example, he has a great talent for capturing models as they start to fall into a swimming pool.In many cases, suble humor adds to the picture, as with the swimming pool props. I especially liked the photographs where Mr. Newton appears in the photograph through his use of mirrors. Equally amusing were the photographs where the models photographed themselves using mirrors in the same way.As sexual mores and tastes loosened up over the years, Mr. Newton's work became more playful and free. I also thought it worked better. I enjoyed the brief essays in the book in which he explained how his relations with editors affected his assignments and the style limitations which he had to observe.Seeing these images made me hunger for a similar book filled with luscious, perfectly-reproduced images of just these photographs on large pages of great paper. Hopefully, a publisher will indulge me in the future. Now that will be a more than five-star book!After enjoying the poses and compositions, I suggest you think about where in your life you may be presenting yourself or your ideas in ways that steal much of their power.

It was made into a terrific British TV series with Tom Conti, and it reads like it was written for TV - there's tons of absolutely brilliant, witty and sparkling dialogue, but so little background information about each scene that it's sometimes tricky to keep track of which character is saying what and how specific remarks affect the people who hear them.It's worth the effort, though, because the book provides a wonderfully vivid snapshot of how a bunch of clever folks of widely varied personalities responded to the challenges of their time. These are people with well-developed social consciences, great senses of humor and a deep appreciation for their friendships, but they're also incredibly furtive and childish about sex and their education has badly under-prepared them for the exigencies of making a living, which leads many of them to become awfully cynical awfully quickly as soon as the prospects of fame and wealth start to intrude upon their intimacies.Come to think of it, these were probably the most widespread character flaws amongst the people I went to college with, back in the 1990s.

Apparently Joe feels bitterness now about being refused (by Morrissey, Warhol or his people) a career in Hollywood, after this &quot;Trilogy&quot;. Although Morrissey (as reported in this book) seems less than genuine by denying the facts, Joe should not feel frustrated. It was quite normal at that time, that Morrissey and others, who had launched Joe's &quot;career&quot;, did not want to lose him. If Joe had wanted to make it by himself, he could have moved to California, and tried (quickly) his luck. Beautiful as he was, he would soon have found an agent, or an influent &quot;sponsor&quot; (woman or gay) to push him at the right places.Instead (after these three successful films) he made apparently all the wrong moves. He first followed the Morrissey/Warhol party to Rome and &quot;starred&quot; in two so-called &quot;Warhol movies&quot; (Dracula and Frankenstein) which were embarrassing failures.And then he tried to make a career for himself in the Italian cinema. He should have known that apart from first class directors (like Visconti, Fellini, Antonioni or Pasolini, to name just four or them) the Italian cinema was and remains hopeless, and their films, made for interior consumption, hardly cross the Alps, let alone the Atlantic.Yes, Clint Eastwood, Klaus Kinsky, Charles Bronson, started a career in Rome. But they were not &quot;teen actors&quot;. They were action movie heroes, of the macho or even sadistic types. The mistake &quot;Little Joe&quot; made was to try the same trick, and enter in the &quot;action movies&quot;. He was not made for that, any more than (say) Charles Bronson or Lee Marvin could have played in &quot;HEAT&quot; and have a stint with Sylvia Miles in the staircase.The sad truth seems to be that &quot;Little Joe&quot; (away from Morrissey and the Factory) had no mentor, nobody to advise him in the complicated and merciless world of the movies. He became a &quot;star&quot; by accident, he had no way of continuing it by his own will. As a matter of fact, even in Hollywood, very few child or teen actors ever make it further than their success years.Cinema is a game of actors. What you sell is a face. Morrissey knew that very well, when he kept his camera focused on Dallesandro, Holly Woodlawn, Pat Ast or Andrea Feldman. He did not want to miss one moment, not one second of their looks. He knew his job. But he also knew when the game (the innocence) was over.It would have been very difficult for anybody (especially without proper actor's training) to start a new career. Teen idols do not last long. James Dean killed himself in his Porsche, Brando became fat. Joe Dallesandro is still alive and well, and this book does the right thing by telling us how he became what he was, and survived.The only drawback is that it has been published in a collection of &quot;gay&quot; books featuring (Quote) &quot;over 100 nude photos, including full-frontal&quot; (Unquote). I never saw Joe Dallesandro as a &quot;gay icon&quot;, nor thought that his acting was intended for voyeuristic purposes, or even belonged to the gay world. I thought of it as quite natural, and that (although obviously provocative) it was intended to show people &quot;the way they are&quot;. Presenting Joe Dallesandro in a gay and kinky context does not really help his recognition as the fine film actor, he was. But probably, the author of the book had no other solution."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"I can not believe the bad reviews - I feel they have a personal issue, not one with the book. No book has this complete of a listing of Joe films. The author has done a fantastic job of not just reviews the film, but giving a reason why they should be seen. Joe has had quite a life and this B movie stars book is a good read. But for a collector of movies and someone who is interested in film, this book is the bible for Joe."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"This is the greatest book on Joe! Ferguson reveiws all his films (even the ones most of us haven't seen!) and adds tremendous information directly from Joe about his life and experiences. Nowhere else have I ever seen this! There are tons of great pictures, and this is the only place you can get them - many are from Joe's collection! Ferguson really knows Joe. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"For anyone who is even vaguely familiar with the work of actor Joe Dallesandro, this is MUST reading/viewing!Of the array of quirky talent that Warhol assembled in his stable of actors, Dallesandro was an easy STANDOUT from the rest, for a number of reasons; not the least of which was that the man was a NATURAL TALENT! Even among the critics who DESPISED Warhol's films,virtually ALL were forced to agree on one thing:Dallesandro was a REAL TALENT.Unlike Warhol's other &quot;Discoveries&quot;(most of whom required almost constant &quot;high maintenance&quot;), for Dallesandro, acting came almost as easy as breathing. Here is a man who is that RARE THING: a BORN actor. His acting from the start(to the present)is ASTONISHING to watch:natural and unaffected(NO poser HERE)yet deeply moving and personal. The range of characters he has literally breathed life into is both diverse and fascinating to watch-never dull or mundane!What I find intriguing is that with almost NO formal training as a &quot;Serious&quot; actor, he has managed to effectively create a WIDE scope of characters(everything from young hustlers to gangsters to anti-heroes to romantic leading-man types in the classic sense)and yet is NOT hailed as a truly WONDERFUL character actor by either his peers OR most of his fans. One need only watch but a sample of the WIDE body of work he has done in his long career(spanning everything from cinema to television)to realize that he is capable of almost ANY facet of the dramatic arts: from high comedy to classic drama and THEN some!I would personally LOVE to see him offered more LEADING roles (rather than the support work he has primarily done in the latter half of his career). In this matter the book is INVALUABLE in it's thorough, indepth exploration of his work-going WELL BEYOND merely an overview of his long career(a mistake too often made in most bios of actors). Author Michael Ferguson has meticulously, lovingly assembled Joe's history in film as I have never seen it presented prior. In numerous, GORGEOUS photos, revealing &amp; personal memoirs(Joe and the actors/directors/writers etc. he has worked with)and actual critic's reviews presented here, one with NO knowledge of Joe's work whatsoever can read this book and gain a comprehensive knowledge of why even today Joe is considered one of the pillars of New Cinema.Lastly, what I found compelling reading was the brutal honesty Joe offers in his memoirs here:both about himself and those he has worked with. Whether discussing his family life, his memories of those he has worked with, or his life views/values, Joe truly pulls no punches. He is clearly NOT interested in trying to present himself as a STAR, or even in flattering terms. Rather, he wants to set the record STRAIGHT-cutting through the rumors and half-truths to tell it like it REALLY was/is.Joe, you RULE!"},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"\\"Gay and straight fans worldwide have been infatuated with Joe Dallesandro since Andy Warhol made him famous, and the underground films made him a sexual icon.

It is really too bad that many of these films haven't been released as some sort of \\"Little Joe\\" DVD Box Set in the United States, particularly the post-Warhol European films like \\"Black Moon\\" and \\"Seeds of Evil.\\" Joe has been a hard-working actor for decades now, and he deserves this well-researched testament to his work."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"Imagine. To be a cult film icon wanted by both men and women. Such a thing is rare and even though I'm not of the homosexual persuasion, I would be flattered that men thought me just as beautiful as women did! Anyway, this book is great. Joe was and is a legend and may not be the best of actors, but he is certainly an original that cannot be rivaled. I must agree with the author below, though. This book should not be touted as a &quot;gay book&quot;. Joe was an actor, not aimed at men or women but both. I think women might find it hard to enjoy this book because Joe is made to look like a gay pin-up boy, which isn't a bad thing, mind you, but will possibly limit the reading audience of this book! Anyway, check this book out, full of great pictures, the full participation of Joe himself, and even background information on his directors and co-stars."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"Joe Dallessandro (or Dalessandro, or D'Allessandro, etc.) is an actor for whom I always have had an almost obsessive passion, not simply because of his incomparable and mysterious physical beauty, which has such a sheen to it (e.g. the pellucidly luminous glow of his nipples, the impressive scale and beautiful shape of his genitals, his skin's fine complexion, the lure of his long, straight, beautifully textured hair, etc.), but because Dallessandro drew one into his acting and persona so compellingly yet in such a seemingly effortlessly low-key, unself-consciously subtle way. His acting was not deadpan, or stiff, or overly reliant on his magnificent physical attributes alone, but deeply personal and compellingly genuine. Small gests that others do not notice, a change of _expression, a look of cunning manipulation, of a kind of passive surprise, and so forth, would be hard for most actors to realise if they were scripted for them, yet Dallessandro did all of this in the semi-improvisatory manner in which his films with Warhol and those associated with him were made. Ferguson has a keen appreciation of these elusive qualities that made Dallessandro such a rivetting and fascinating actor as well as such an overwhelmingly gorgeous physical presence in his films, where he so eclipses in interest all but a few of the other actors in the casts. He deals feelingly with Joe Dallessandro's brother, who died at such a young age and whose own physical allure shares such an obviously fraternal resemblance to that of Little Joe himself.The photos in the book are not particularly well reproduced, merely adequate in quality, but would have benefitted from being printed on glossy paper with greater photographic resolution and contrast, as some of the same photos reveal their potential on the glossy front and back covers of the book. Still, it is good to have so many photos (from those of his \\"beefcake\\" physique photo posing days of the earlier years of his adolescence onwards) of this incomparably sensuous man in one place. The author's style is enthusiastic and not particularly literary, but his real love of Dallessandro and of his work gives the book a sincerity and depth of appreciation that still, alas, are all too seldom expressed regarding Joe Dallessandro. It is quite a wonderment to learn of the many films, besides the famous ones, that \\"Little Joe\\" made over the years, and the author's appreciation of them makes one yearn to see them all, and Ferguson's success in arousing such curiosity to explore Dallessandro's legacy is one indicator of his own success as a writer!I have lived with this book, returning to it often, and it always gives me pleasure to open it, to gaze on Joe Dallessandro's sheer physical splendour and to read his words quoted and those of the author expressed so feelingly about this icon of erotic (and other) film."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"I don't know that you can fairly judge a biography or autobiography based on the subject matter. If the person interests you then you are going to find the book interesting - unless the book is just horribly written (this is often the case, sadly). However, Michael Ferguson has done a fine job of working with a man who literally stumbled into acting years ago in New York.Joe Dallesandro (or Little Joe) was a street tough kid from New York when he wandered onto the set of an Andy Warhol film. He was cast in that film right away. I won't summarize the biography, because there's no point in doing so. However, I will say that Ferguson takes us along on a brief, but thorough walk through Joe's life to the present day. Then we get to learn about each of the films that Joe has made in great detail.No, Joe isn't Bette Davis or Olivier or even John Wayne, but I would have liked to have had the biographical information appear in a bit more detail. That's my own peeve, but it isn't really fair, since we're talking about a guy who was doing nudity in \\"art\\" films in the 60's - a guy who played a German peasant in turn of the century Germany with a Brooklyn accent. This is not an actor who would ever win any awards for his talent, unless his talent was is body and face. And what a body and face he had for the times.Little Joe lets us take a brief look at a Warhol creation that lived far beyond its intended artistic life. Joe Dallesandro the man is far different from the beautiful face and body on the screen. Timeless there in appearance, his real life was never what others fantasized about him. This guy is still a street tough scrapper who is just barely scraping by today.I think the material is interesting and the writing is effective and worthwhile. If you have a nostalgic bent toward Warhol's Factory days or just liked his weird horror films or sexy films, then you'll enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"A fantastic book! Author Michael Ferguson has done a superb job researching the life and career of Joe Dallesandro. You'll find out tons of things you didn't know. I especially liked the sections on Loves of Ondine and San Diego Surf, because those are two Warhol movies that very few people have ever seen. Plus, Joe Dallesandro gave exclusive interviews to the author!I don't know what the last &quot;reviewer&quot; on this page was expecting. Sounds like he's got an axe to grind. I'd be more than happy to buy his copy from him and give a home to an unloved book, especially one so obviously a labor of love as Little Joe Superstar!"},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"Well written and entertaining summary of Joe's films. Definately a must for fans and certainly terrific for anyone interested in the era or movies in general. Great collection of photos as well."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"I hated this book.This book doesn't succeed in presenting Dallesandro in a way that could draw the reader in. If you dislike Dallesandro you may dislike him even more by the time your through reading this book, which shouldn't be long as its a quick read. I personally took offence to Dallesandro's forward, where he refers to anyone who hasn't followed his career as \\"SCUM.\\" This guy must have a real problem relating to people.Do yourself a favor &amp; pass on this book. A much better value is Pat Hackett's - The Warhol Diaries. This book is chuck full of great information about everyone within Warhols circle, you will learn more about the true Dallesandro from Hachett's book."},{"Title":"Little Joe, Superstar: The Films of Joe Dallesandro","review":"Little Joe Superstar?This guy has been hustling people for decades. Anyone who has seen any movie, which included Dallesandro, would immediately learn that he has little to no serious acting ability. This book however, puts Dallesandro on some high ground. After reading it you might think he's speaking of an acadamy award winner.So I still can't believe that I purchased this book, but after looking through it it became clear that Dallesandro hooked up with someone with a similar background... The author simply has little writing ability."},{"Title":"Randomized Algorithms","review":"This book is a jewel. It demonstrates how clever and beautifully simple probabilistic ideas can lead to the design of very efficient algorithms. I like its very verbal intuitive style,with proof strategies being always transparently explained.For computer scientists, this is *the* reference work in randomized algorithms, by now a major paradigm of algorithms design. For classical probabilists, thiscould serve as an eye-opener on unsuspected applications of their field to important areas of computer science."},{"Title":"Randomized Algorithms","review":"I've taken two CS classes that use this book and I always felt like this book was very informative. The algorithms and concepts that Motwani brings forth are extremely insightful and interesting. However, the presentation of the proofs has a lot of room for improvement. Notation is carried over from previous chapters and is sometimes unexplained, which makes it very difficult for someone who does not have a lot of familiarity with the material presented. The book presents very interesting topics and leaves a lot of open (unresolved) questions to the reader's curiosity and challenge."},{"Title":"Randomized Algorithms","review":"Overall, the authors explain core concepts, the examples and the possible applications well. However, the readibility of their proof is far from that of the above three. Honestly some proofs should be re-written completely.For example, in page 116, they try to use the induction method to prove Lova(')sz Local Lemma. After reading that page many times, I still didn't understand the structure of their proof.I was TA for under-grad level algorithm course, got A+ in advanced Calculus II and A in intro. to PDE (both in under-grad level), really knew something about induction method and a little bit about algorithm. I am not smart, but far from stupid.In the end, I google the internet and found a 3-page proof for the same thing. That's easy to catch in few minutes, and then, I understand the 1-page proof in the book. Is it ironic?"},{"Title":"Randomized Algorithms","review":"Algorithms are my specialty, and I'm really interest in everything that is connected with them. This is one of the few books from the field of algorithms that I was a problem to read. I found this book hard to read because of several reasons.Firstly, i have a problem with the composition of material from the book. The material is in the many places presented in the unnatural way. Book is method oriented, so often same problem is treated in several places in the book. On the other hand the book is not fully method oriented, so there are chapters of the book that don't present any method of building randomized algorithms. There are several chapters that are organized around some concept from the probability theory. I don't see the reason for these two orientation to be mixed.Often I have a feeling that authors are not particulary interested in randomized algorithms, and that thet their main interest is to show probability methods in the theory of algorithms. So, there are, for example, chapters in the book named \\"Moments and Deviations\\" and \\"Tail Inequalities\\". I don't want to say that these concepts are not important for the randomized algorithm complexity claculations, but I think that such chapters belongs to book on probability theory, not randomized algorithms book. On the other side, therms of Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms get together one section in the chapter in which they are described. It is true that in these chapters contain randomized algorithms as examples of usage of mathematical concepts, but the question is: should this book present general mathematical concepts, or randomized algorithms.The second big drawback is lack of precise mathematical notion in many places in the book. For example, in the chapter on game theory the reader get impression that the whole game theory are game trees. Yet, authors fail to define what game tree is. The definition they give is more lausy desciption than definition. They don't say which kind of tree is game tree. Is it binary? Of course it is not, but authors in this section work only with binary trees. Further, in the text authors said that this tree is uniform. I have to admit that I never heard about uniform trees. The problem is that all definitions in the book is given in this way, by the paragraph of the text, which describe the term, not define it. In fact, the only concepts that are properly defined are ones form the probability theory. None of the concepts from the algorithms theory or data structures theory is not defined as it should be.The third great problem with the book is that these concepts are never ilustrated with the concrete example. There is a section about the game trees, for example, but there is no single game tree for some game generated in this section. This is not a single case. All examples in the book are about mathmatical, or nore precisely probability theory concepts, and all of them looks like they are taken from the workbook on probability theory, and doesn't have any connection with algorithms.Another problem is that all chapters are not builded in the same manner. There are chapters (unfortenately very little of them) that have theoretical overview of the method they deal with, but in the other chapters there are no proper theoretical description of the method of the matter.To resume, this book shows the lack of concept and system in the writting, as well as the interest of authors more in mathmatics than in algorithm field.My opinion is that there are much better books on the randomized algorithms tnan this one."},{"Title":"Randomized Algorithms","review":"The book has an exoustive amount of algorithms.

This means things are a little different for me than for someone who owns a physical copy. The book is great for checking to see if a word is valid, but less useful for looking for word ideas, due to the fact that you can't quickly page through it. When my family plays Scrabble we play it more for fun than for a challenge, so we allow each other to flip through dictionaries to look for word ideas. You can't really do that with this book on the Kindle, because you can't change pages very quickly. Yes, you can search for a word, but you can't, for example, find if a word is spelled properly or not by easily checking in that section of the book. All you will find if you search is whether or not the word is in the book. It won't tell you words that are close to it, or help you find what you may be looking for, like you could with a physical book.

Meanwhile the official Scrabble dictionary has been updated twice. The new edition is worthwhile, especially with the 2 and 3 letter lists which are essential for playing Scrabble well.Meanwhile,SCRABBLE WordbookandBob's Bible: Words, Anagrams and Hooksoffer a lot more to the beginning, serious and expert players. The Wordbook has been a staple of Scrabble tournament players since the late 1980s. It's chockful of lists and ideas for studying. It's only two drawbacks are the tiny print (for some) and the removal of words like FATSO that are legal in tournaments (it's the school edition). The author does offer free bookmarks with the missing words.Bob's Bible is my favorite tournament study book. The latest edition includes lists of the 2s, 3s, 4s and even 5s. The main section is a full (offical) list of 2-8 letter words. Next to each word are the front hooks and the back hooks to make words one letter longer... like STAMPED e (makes stampede!) Below each word are all the anagrams. So underneath SENATOR it lists atoners, santero and treason. There are even Jumble quizzes for thousands of words you need to know. The special Q-word section has words like QI QAT QANAT QABALAH TRANQ etc and also BUQSHA, OBLOQUY, EXEQUY and COLLOQUY (not to mention MBAQANGA).The coolest 2 sections in the book are lists of all, and only, the words that have front hooks, and a section for back hooks that change the meaning of the word or are non-standard plurals like AE. These are alphabetically listed for each word length from 2 to 8.By all means, get the Word-Building book, but getBob's Bible: Words, Anagrams and HooksandSCRABBLE Wordbookfirst!"},{"Title":"Scrabble Word Building Book","review":"Scrabble has been an integral part of our family for over 50 years. The originators (Grandmother and her sisters) were highly competitive and were totally against the idea of looking up words prior to playing. But, in order to encourage the game with the fourth generation, the rules have been relaxed.As a result, this book is extremely helpful to teach adding on to words and multiple-word plays. While it just consists of alphabetized lists, we make it a rule that you also have to look up the meaning of the word in the Scrabble dictionary, if not known.But beware... while the book is fairly complete, there are some words that are not included which can be found in earlier editions of the Official Scrabble Dictionary.So, the recommendation is, this makes a fun and wonderful companion book, but should not be relied on alone."},{"Title":"Scrabble Word Building Book","review":"I use this book to occasionally jog my memory or generate an idea for an add-on word if I'm stuck.

There are 40 plus Lutheran colleges, and none of them are in here. Since I'm mostly interested in Lutheran colleges I couldn't find what I wanted here, but was stunned by how the Maoism of the 60s has translated into a total Cultural Revolution through almost all of our better institutions. Probably nobody even realizes we are living through the last gasp of Mao's Cultural Revolution.Almost none of the schools profiled here have survived it -- Grove City, and Case Western, are the two that I remember having done so. Why are these other schools still open? Why would anybody go to Oberlin college, where the music department teaches that oral sex on stage is good enough for a master's exhibition of classical music? It's just baffling why people would pay 40 grand for what they can get in a toilet in any bar for free."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I am a high school senior preparing to choose a college, and bought this book in the hopes that it would give me a \\"real-life\\" view of schools. I was highly disappointed. The book spends a ridiculous amount of time decrying 'political-correctness' and how students at the more conservative colleges find it 'annoying'. There is a red, yellow, green light feature to convey how politically open and unbiased the schools are. Schools such as Northwestern, Yale, Harvard, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Tufts, and basically every other highly regarded institution are given yellow or red lights for being 'too liberal' in the classroom, whereas Brigham Young, Thomas Aquinas, SMU, and other conservative universities are apparently the epitome of open-mindedness and given green lights. I can't quite imagine a pro-choice person lasting long at BYU, but according to the book, 'politics are not introduced in the classroom'. A quote in the Trinity College 'yellow light' review reads, \\"No doubt about it, Trinity is a liberal college.\\" Apparently, this means that it is tyrannical and close-minded. The book also laments any type of co-ed housing and seems to be a guide for hardcore conservatives looking for a place where they'll be in the majority. Most college campuses are indeed liberal. This book can't quite get over it."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I think the book is excellent.

As a recent college graduate, I was curious to see if the book gave a fair evaluation on my alma mater (Wash U). What I found was a biased indictment on the politics of the school and poorly disguised conservative leanings. Although I think that it's SOMEWHAT helpful for parents to be aware of the popular politics and activist tendencies of particular institutions, the book devoted much more time to this matter rather than focusing on more important topics such as the overall quality of the undergraduate education, opportunities for jobs and graduate scholarship after commencement, and the satisfaction of the student body. Instead of offering a fair and balanced view of higher education this book sneers at universities for striving to achieve diversity, liberal acitvism, and the politicization of classes (apparently classes are only politicized if they, God forbid, discuss subject matters other than traditional Western-centric themes). I don't want to sound like someone who is obsessed with political correctness - I am not. I appreciate and welcome different points of view. However, I do have problems with a book that pretends to be unbiased and informative when all it is in fact a guide for conservatives to bash on what they perceive as the liberal corruption of America's colleges and universities. I recommend this book for right-wingers and hardcore conservatives who want a narrow-minded and rambling guide to colleges."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I found this book very strange. It is misrepresenting itself as a general college guide. The only people who would find it helpful are neo-conservatives whose only criteria in choosing a university is that it not have any \\"feminists\\" or \\"multiculturalism\\" on campus. It covers over 100 schools, dividing each review into 3 sections: academic life, political atmosphere, and student life. The reviews are rather brief and do not offer any helpful information (size, location, admissions, etc.) that could not be found in other college guides. The other information presented is highly editorialized. The authors seem a bit obsessed with bringing up random sexual harassment lawsuits, and the phrase \\"politically correct\\" appears on nearly every page. It's also obvious they have not done a lot of interviewing of current students and faculty."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I have visited one of the colleges this book recommends, and examined its library carefully.

One must also study the timely.

They also attack most of these schools for a lack of a strong required core curriculum and for a left wing political correctness which stifles open discussion. The question is, how much of the information presented by the authors is true and how much is grossly distorted? Unfortunately, the reader needs to be very careful before believing much of what the authors set forth, because the authors have an extreme agenda of their own.Numerous second rate colleges receive high praise in this book. The common denominator here is that these schools have a strong religious orientation and in some cases even require declarations of religious belief prior to admission. The authors would have us accept that education filtered by adherence to unquestioned religious dogma (some of these schools try to teach science without evolution) is somehow good as opposed to the bad dogma and political correctness imposed by the top schools. The truth is that any required sets of beliefs and the imposition of any dogma is incompatible with true open education. I bought this book based on its title and a brief publisher review and I was mislead. This book should be titled something like &quot;Finding a College Where Religious Beliefs are not Challenged&quot;."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"August 24, 2001 (in his syndicated newspaper column)Choosing a collegeBy Thomas SowellAbout this time every year, high school seniors and their parents start trying to figure out how to choose a college. With application deadlines for some colleges starting as early as this fall for students who want to begin college next fall, there is not a lot of time. When you take into account the lead time needed to apply to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American College Testing Program's exam -- and then the time before the results are tabulated and sent out to the college admissions offices -- there is not much time left, even for those students who are applying for colleges whose deadlines are next January or February.Nevertheless, a hasty decision can have repercussions that last for years. Campus stresses can lead to psychiatric problems, drug dependency or even suicide. It happens from the Ivy League to Podunk U. One lovely young woman committed suicide by jumping from the building in which I had my office at UCLA and I saw her body in the bushes on my way to work. Another whom I encountered had picked up a devastating drug habit at Harvard.Much more is involved in choosing a college than whether they have prestigious professors or high SAT scores.On some campuses, black students will live as segregated a life as in the days of the Jim Crow South, and find other black students resenting them if they spend their time in the library or at the computer lab, instead of in racial breast-beating activities. But the atmosphere is very different on other campuses where students of all races can make education their top priority.None of this is covered in the brightly colored brochures that the college admissions offices send you and most college guides don't get down to this kind of nitty gritty. However, there is one college guide that does. It is titled &quot;Choosing the Right College&quot; and it has an introduction by Bill Bennett. The National Catholic Register calls it: &quot;A godsend for anyone who wants to know how to beat the academic establishment and actually get an education.&quot;There are many colleges and universities where it is possible to get a fine education -- but where you can also graduate without learning anything that you don't want to learn. You can get a degree from some of the most prestigious institutions in America without having a clue about science, history, math or economics, because you take only the courses you want to take.The latest edition of Choosing the Right College quotes a Harvard student: &quot;You can get away without learning a scrap of European or U.S. history.&quot; It also quotes a Harvard professor who says that the core curriculum there &quot;is absolutely onerous in its gobbling up of students' time in courses that often enough are weak fare.&quot; And for four years of this, you are paying over a hundred grand in tuition!Choosing the Right College is not just about muck-raking. It also tells you about colleges and universities that may not have big names, but which offer a finer education than some other places that are household words. For example, it calls Claremont McKenna College in Southern California &quot;an excellent stomping ground for any student serious about his education.&quot; Of Rhodes College in Tennessee, it says: &quot;Of the 110 institutions reported on in this guide, Rhodes is among the most distinctive and distinguished.&quot;Institutions with strong educational traditions that are under siege from more ideologically faddish elements on campus are also covered -- the University of Chicago, Davidson and Birmingham-Southern, for example. So are places like Reed College, where the radical fads prevail, as &quot;politicization&quot; has become &quot;entrenched,&quot; and where the college is described as &quot;a farm team for graduate schools.&quot;Choosing the Right College does not rank institutions numerically, the way U.S. News &amp; World Report does in its guide called America's Best Colleges. That is part of the reason why Choosing the Right College is the best of the college guides and America's Best Colleges is the worst.There is no such thing as the best college. The real question is whether a particular college is right for a particular individual. The more three-dimensional picture presented in Choosing the Right College helps parents and students to make the right choices for themselves, given the student's own abilities, interests and priorities.If your local bookstore doesn't have this college guide, ask them to order it. It is well worth the effort.2001 Creators Syndicate, Inc."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"Choosing a college is a tough task--whether you're the student, their parent or their college counselor. This book definitely makes the process easier.The typical high school junior receives dozens of glossy college viewbooks in the mail from the time they complete their first PSAT throughout their senior year. These viewbooks would have you believe that there's not a college out there that doesn't have very small classes, bright and multi-talented students, professors who are at each student's beck and call, and (let's not forget the classic) a class or two held outdoors, preferably with a beach nearby.While the picture is a pretty one, it's not complete. This book clues you in about what education is really like at some of the nation's most revered colleges and universities. The editors approach the book from the viewpoint that a classic liberal arts undergraduate education is the most valuable to the individual and society so their natural focus is on how well this type of education is provided at various institutions. A classic liberal arts education highlights Western Civilization's developments in math, science and literature and this book's editors are determined in revealing how closely each college's core curriculum reflects that bent.If, instead, you're looking for a college or university where the dogma is politically correct, where there is no absolute truth and where students call the shots, you might still appreciate reading this book because it is clear in explaining just what campuses feature that type of education.Each school is reviewed through interviews with current professors and students, with detailed evaluations of curriculum, with a bit of the school's history and goals, and even, in some cases, by checking out which library sections are well-stocked and with what type of books. The editors reveal each school's highly-politicized departments, if any, as well as what student life is really like.While I would have liked to have seen more colleges reviewed in this book, the authors do a good job of targeting the &quot;name&quot; schools and also including many lesser-known institutions which the editors feel are doing a an exceptional job in educating students. This helped our family incredibly because it steered us to several schools we might not have considered.How accurate is the book? I can only speak anecdotally; we have a son who attends Thomas Aquinas College (we first heard of it in this book) and, after a year of school, he re-read the review of his school and found it absolutely on target. With such a solid correlation between what was written about TAC and the way it actually is, I have faith in the editors' reviews of the other schools in this book.In short, this book is a real gem, with solid information that is much more revealing than the typical college guidebook."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I like this book for the type of informtion it gives on colleges, such as the political atmosphere and the type of curriculum. Many schools have eliminated core requirements and indeed, some have actually added politically chareged courses as required while eliminating traditional, time tested courses in Western Civilization. The analyses are useful and are very detailed. This is not a quick glimpse into the schools covered, but rather, a detailed description. I graduated from Vassar College years ago and had the impression that it was a bastion of political correctness. The profile in this book bears this out. This guide is truly unique and useful.I have a major problem with this guide, however. There are many colleges I wanted to read about but they were not included in the book. For example Binghmapton University is covered but none of the other schools in the SUNY system are. There was nothing about several goog schools in Pennsylvania such as Franklin and Marshall, Dickinson, Bucknell, Lehigh, Gettysburg, etc. Ohio State University is covered well but there is nohing on other major schools in Ohio's state system such as Ohio University and Miami University (or for that matter, Universitey of Miami in Florida). The book is good, as far as it goes, but many, if not most of the colleges I was interested in reading about are not profiled."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"This college guide is based on what have become on many college campuses today radical premises: 1) There are some important things to learn, and not all college freshmen already know these things (or what they are) before they even get to college; 2) before you criticize, condemn or just ignore all &quot;Western&quot; culture, perhaps you should actually know something about it; 3) colleges should encourage critical thinking and balanced study over simple absorption of commonly accepted points of view; and 4) the First Amendment should be allowed free exercise on college campuses. It does a good job of describing to what extent the colleges profiled in the book fit these premises.If you haven't followed the changes in the American university in the last 30 years, while you were out some big changes have happened. The confluence of postmodern, poststructuralist theory and radical leftist politics have converted many universities into ideologically-driven intellectual killing fields. The misuse of the PM/PS discoveries of linguistic and cultural contexts to justify &quot;deconstructing&quot; all &quot;truths&quot; except those asserted by whomever is doing the deconstructing have led to the notion that there are no universal truths, only points of view and culturally-relative constructs. Of course, that point of view is asserted to be universally true across all cultures, but never mind. Why is this relevant to choosing a college?The rise of PM/PS relativism has been used as the intellectual justification to abandon core curricula and the study of Western cultural heritage. If there are no truths, then there are only power elites pushing their culturally constructed points of view. In the case of Western civilization, this has meant the dominance of the oppressive, racist, imperialistic patriarchy. If Western culture is to be studied at all, it is only to be &quot;deconstructed&quot;,&quot; which means attacked and discredited in toto. Chaucer, Plato, Homer, Plotinus, St. Augustine, Kant, Milton, and all the rest are relevant only as examples of a culture that is corrupt and illegitimate at its core, end of discussion. Using the honorable goals of encouraging the histories and points of view of other cultures, the new proponents of &quot;multiculturalism,&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; have in fact created a climate in which all cultures are worthy of honor except the one that gave birth to that concept. And &quot;diversity&quot; really means, in good Orwellian fashion, adherence to a narrow view critical of all things Western. Under this point of view, the shortcomings of Western civilization are the ONLY aspects of WC worth studying. Not merely that these may be valid aspects to study, but that they are the ONLY aspects worthy of study. This book attempts to root out colleges (and programs or departments within colleges) that still offer at least the option of studying the non-politically fashionable aspects of the Western canon.That is why the premises of this book have become radical on today's campuses. You can glance through some of the other reviews of this book here and find evidence that these premises have also become associated with the dreaded &quot;right wing&quot; or religious indoctrination (as opposed to the secular indoctrination now dominant on so many campuses.) According to that point of view, this book should be stamped out, just as its premises should be purged from our college campuses, which they largely have. The fact is, this book does not advance right-wing political doctrine, but only the notion that there is a body of knowledge (the Western canon) worth learning, even for the purpose of knowledgeably criticizing it, and that people who do not agree in every respect with whatever political point of view is in fashion on a campus should not be silenced, intimidated or threatened. Radical, huh?&quot;Choosing the Right College&quot; reports on the absence or existence of a core curriculum (as opposed to near or total lack of any curricular structure), in case you too cling to the archaic notion that colleges should offer some guidance as to what used to be called a &quot;liberal&quot; education might consist of. It attempts to describe the political environment and free speech climate. Free speech and the ability to critique the political views of professors are in notorious short supply on campuses these days. The term &quot;politically correct&quot; was first coined to refer to the curtailment of free speech on college campuses. Contrary opinions are routinely literally shouted down, purged from print or public discourse and labelled as &quot;hate&quot; speech or the like. In case you think this is not conducive to education, much less freedom, this book will give some hints as to which colleges allow more, or less freedom of expression and thought.This book gives the college searcher a tool to get a clue as to the contentof the education they (or their progeny) are likely to get at the colleges profiled. It gives the reader a quick screening device for colleges most (and least) likely to meet the criteria set out in its premises. It will help the reader start formulating questions to find out more, as their college search progresses. No other college guide does this, that I am aware of, and I have looked at dozens.As for this book advancing &quot;right-wing&quot; values? Well, it does alert the reader to the existence of core curricula in such right-wing bastions as, say, Columbia University. If you think that kind of thought should be stamped out, don't buy this book. Or better yet, buy it and stage a burning."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"Homeschoolers and others concerned with safety and overall moral quality of life on campus will find Choosing the Right College provides detailed advice. Combined with specifics on the quality of education, this makes the guide a real stand-out."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"Although I already possess a B.A., I became interested in reading the book after hearing about it from both Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams. When I arrived at the store, I noticed on the back of the book that John Silber thought highly of the book. After reading an interview with Silber in the magazine American Enterprise and being impressed by what he had to say, his recommendation seemed to lend the final piece of nudging that I needed to buy the book.The book has four main sections for each college covered. The first section gives the reader an overview of the institution. The second section highlights general education requirements, or lack of them, and focuses on satisfactory and unsatisfactory departments alike. In addition, the section includes a short list of professors that the authors consider excellent. The third section provides a description of the political atmosphere at the university. The final section offers an overview of the surrounding community's living and cultural environment.With eager anticipation I read through the book. It slowly changed my views about the excellence of many name brand elite institutions and introduced me to smaller institutions (e.g. St John's College and Thomas Aquinas College) that seemed to have stellar undergraduate systems. However, when I got to the section on my alma mater, it dawned on me that perhaps the book wasn't as outstanding as I had believed it to be. As I read the description of The Ohio State University, I had a hard time reconciling my experience with the statements that the authors were making. (I graduated fall quarter 2000 with a B.A. as a double major in Medieval and Renaissance Studies and Political Science from The Ohio State University. I took various economic, history, political science, and language classes including 30 credit hours of Latin.) Had I really attended a university whose intellectual stature was along the lines of a community college? I decided to sit down and look at what the book postulates and compare it to what common sense, critical thought, and a little bit of research would yield.The review in the book begins by stating that OSU is \\"not the place to go for a liberal arts education, if you have a choice\\" and that \\"OSU liberal arts faculty...agree that students looking for a serious liberal arts education would be better served elsewhere.\\" The book does acknowledge that Ohio State's size makes it difficult to generalize attributes and that the \\"primary advantage of a large school like OSU\\" is that traces of traditionalism can be found in most departments on account of their size. It also notes that according to one professor, \\"only \`focused, savvy undergraduates' interested in going on for a professional or graduate degree...will be well served at OSU.\\"While it is true that Ohio State does not require all students to become enlightened liberal arts graduates, the book sorely understates the possibility of a student graduating with a great education in the liberal arts. With an English department having close to seventy faculty members, a History faculty of similar depth, a Political Science department with close to fifty faculty members, an Economics department with forty members, a Philosophy department with twenty-five members, and a Latin and Greek department of sixteen faculty members, one would be hard-pressed to write all of them off as poor teachers or mediocre intellectuals unless one had a grudge to pick with Ohio State. The History department is home to numerous medieval and European historians. Among some of the better teachers are Joseph Lynch and Jack Balcer both of which have been recognized for excellence in teaching. The English department has numerous professors who specialize in medieval, renaissance, and British literature. John Champlin offers an unbiased approach to teaching political philosophy in the classroom.Political atmosphere for all schools seems to be based more on anecdotal evidence and feelings than actual data. What would be more helpful, and more accurate, would be for the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) to make use of the data collected in the fall survey of freshmen designed by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP). Numerous universities administer the survey. According to the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI), \\"In Fall 2000, over 404,000 students completed the Freshman Survey at 717 participating institutions nationwide.\\" (Quoted from http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/cirp_freshman_survey_results.htm) The survey asks students to label themselves as one of the following: Far Left, Liberal, Middle of the Road, Conservative, or Far Right. In addition, the survey includes questions concerning the student's stances on certain issues that often stand as markers for political ideology. For example, the survey asks about abortion, same-sex marriages, federal handgun control, and whether or not \\"wealthy\\" people should pay higher taxes. An internet-savvy prospective student would benefit from searching for the survey results of the colleges under consideration as many colleges make the data on their institution available as a PDF file. The researchers could then move on to the faculty and through the use of voting registration (similar to the work done by Karl Zinsmeister) present a breakdown of the political make-up of the humanities or liberal arts departments at a school.Unfortunately, I'm unable to present a more detailed review as the limit is only 1,000 words. (My review was closer to 2,000 words.) The back of the book states that the book is \\"based on in-depth research.\\" However, the work fails to site any sources of information. Doing so would allow the reader to check the validity of the statements. Overall, the book is useful for highlighting colleges that a prospective student may not have heard mentioned in other guides. However, it would be a mistake for students to take the information presented in the book at face value without utilizing other guides and research tools to come to a balanced and objective view of the colleges being reviewed."},{"Title":"Choosing the Right College: The Whole Truth about America's Top Schools","review":"I teach at a major university so I was looking forward to this book. While I believe there is an important rationale for a book like this (to evaluate colleges based on their left-wing bias or lack thereof), this edition was somewhat short of the mark.First, it doesn't rate many colleges, only 110. Second, it provides information more in narrative than in factual ratings which make it seem more biased than it may actually be. Lastly, it's focus is the Humanities and Political Atmosphere but there is much more to college life that ought to be explored.For Instance:I really regretted that it did not have a better breakdown of dorm life. Some \\"elite\\" schools not only require students to live in the dorms but then mandate that all dorms be co-ed (in some cases the ROOMS are co-ed). It would be nice to rule out that kind of foolishness before wasting time on such a school.Also, academic rigor can actually be measured by looking at grade inflation. This book did not do that in any way that allows you to measure one school against another.One thing I did like was a discussion of the crime situation at each campus. Very good info for parents to consider.The beauty of this kind of a guide is that they usually improve with later editions.

If you are just looking for the scoop on your favorite name brand college then forget this book.Read the Introduction carefully and you will see that the philosophy of this ISI approach is to value the schools that have a curriculum that they believe falls into the category of a &quot;Core&quot;.Their belief is that there is a body of information and fundamental skills that are universal to a &quot;well-educated &quot; person. They believe that many colleges have eroded this with &quot;fluff&quot; curriculum courses and lowering of standards. This book reviews schools that they believe have not seriously eroded academic standards. An excellent book for parents. It helped me choose Kenyon College for my daughter last year over more seemingly prestigious schools.

I think this is a subject that has really been neglected in academia and it's not something that is discussed often. However, I would discourage you from getting this book. To me these stories don't reflect the diversity of black women's sexual experience because most of the stories are about women very, very ignorant about sex, themselves, and quite frankly they made themselves and black women in general look bad. I know that every black woman's story isn't peaches and cream, but I also know our stories aren't so ignorant, horrific, and void of understanding either. The women highlighted in this book seemed shallow and stupid. The editing was horrible because the stories are choppy, jump around, and sometimes don't make sense because they aren't chronological. I feel like the book was basically a street lit compilation of sex tales that were more than often depressing and unnecessary.To get a MUCH better idea of black women and sexuality please read 'Stolen Women', it is amazing!!!!

So many of the superficial, cardboard archetypes that are presented - the baby mama, the loveless career woman who is waiting for a black man to make her whole so that she can &quot;exhale,&quot; the gangbanger, the avaricious rump-shaking rap video seductress, the funny fat girl with loads of finger-popping attitude, the longsuffering nurturer, the white girl's selfless best friend/spiritual-soulfulness guru - seem unable or unwilling to get to the heart of who we really ARE, what we are really thinking and feeling about ourselves, our lives, our bodies. Thank God for this collection! These honest, thoughtful, first-person accounts read like transcripts of deep conversations, spiritual exchanges of intimate confidences between these remarkable women and me as spread out over a life-long friendship. We are so often isolated, silenced, shamed into keeping quiet about our pain and frustration, so that we won't air our &quot;dirty laundry&quot; in public and embarrass our race, that we've almost convinced ourselves that our only problems in life are external ones caused by &quot;The Man&quot; - admitting to deep problems within our own homes, our own culture, our own relationships is condemned as disloyal sacrilege. Hearing these women's voices speaking their truths out loud helps me as I continue to identify my own voice and gives me courage to speak out, too. Seeing their continued hopefulness despite all that they've had to face gives me strength. And it lets me know that I am not alone. I bought this book the day that it was released and finished it in one sitting. And I am encouraging all of my friends (and all of you, too!), regardless of race or gender, to read it as well. It is truly funny, sad, inspirational and thought-provoking.

The women outlined inthe book is of various ages, economic, and educational backgrounds. The extensive research and countless interviews propel this author's thought-provoking narratives from women breaking through a sexuality barrier that has always been unspoken of through generations of people of color.LONGING TO TELL rises to the occasion, orchestrating a context that speaks from the voices of women on their sexual relationships, and intimate clich&eacute;s that thrust many into a naive state of ignorance and misinterpreting the art of intimacy.The women's names were changed along with other details to protecttheir identity due to some very graphic details in which theyoutlined their exposure to sexuality. It was a hard lesson for manyand a rude awakening for others. They speak on growing up indysfunctional surroundings, exposure to drugs, and going from onerelationship to another. Several grew up with the pretense that ifyou had sex it meant love.They explain how their families and children had to endure theirunorthodox and self-destructive behaviors that sometimes lead totragic consequences. One woman speaks of how her young son wasbeaten to death by her boyfriend, and never realized the warning signsbecause she stayed in a haze of drugs. They speak candidly about their first sexual encounters with men and women. They speak on where they were and where they are today. They explain their process of healing along the path to finally taking control of their lives.All the women's narratives speak volumes on the depth and courage that made them survivors. In the end, the author sums up very eloquently the overall dynamics of the sexual ramifications that women of color encounter today.LONGING TO TELL by Tricia Rose is a well written book. Tears came to my eyes several times reading some of the stories, and I wanted to jump into the book and hug and congratulate each woman on revealing their personal journey. I applaud Ms. Rose for her insight and courage to develop, research, and talk with so many women who are sisters, mothers, aunts, wives, and friends offering them an outlet in which to speak. A must read for everyone because knowledge is the key to understanding and awareness.

The women range from 19 to 48 and all have powerful storiesto tell about their experiences.All women discussed what it meant to be intimate or have intimacy with aperson. Intimacy was broadly defined and included more than just a sexualrelationship and included relationships with family and friends. Mostwomen defined intimacy in similar terms: a reciprocal relationship withsomeone where you can let down your guard and express yourself without outfear of being judged or criticized.Other themes that arose in the course of the book were Black women'srelationships with Black men. Some of the women had horrific experiencesattempting to love and sustain a relationship with Black men, and whilesome woman had sworn off of Black men and were dating outside the race orwere lesbians, most women were committed to finding love with a Black man.The negative stereotypes of Black women in the media and particularly thoseperpetuated by Black artists were discussed. Sexism within the Blackcommunity was also explored including the stress experienced by Black womenof having to navigate racism and sexism on the outside and then having tocome home to a situation where a woman's contribution and independence arenot valued and where a woman was sometimes viewed as little more thanproperty.The most disturbing subject in the book was sexual violence against women.Many (if not most) of the women interviewed told stories of incest,molestation, rape, sexual harassment or sexual degradation. The bookforcefully brought home the point of how vulnerable Black girls and womenare to sexual abuse and also helped me see that sexual abuse against Blackwomen unfortunately really is not all that surprising when one considersthat Black women have been and continue to be the objects of sexualdegradation in the media and little more than property in relationships.Until Black women are valued for the contributions they bring to thesociety as whole and to relationships in particular, it will continue to be\\"OK\\" to continue the sexual violence against our girls and women.Despite all the negativity directed at Black women, the book highlightedthe fact that Black women are an exceptional group who live in a worldwhere racism and sexism (within and without the Black community) affect ourdaily lives. Nonetheless, we are the keepers of the family and themaintainers of our men. The abuse we are subject to is unparalleled, butwe still strive. The book captured this uniqueness of Black women and away that I have never seen expressed before.I would highly recommend this book to all Black women as it represents acelebration of all that we are. Additionally, in reading this book I wasalso struck by how much Black men could benefit from the stories, and Ialso highly and enthusiastically recommend this book to Black men.5 stars(...)"},{"Title":"Longing to Tell: Black Women's Stories of Sexuality and Intimacy","review":"I am currently a student at UCSC and took one course with Dr. Tricia Rose and could not get enough of it!

Because Tricia Rose has brought us the *everyday* lives of African-American women navigating life in the contemporary US. The women here are ordinary insofar as they face the same struggles with the forces arrayed against all black women in this culture: white supremacy, patriarchy, homophobia, and classism. But she never makes heroines or superwomen of the these women and that is why the book is so powerful. The stereotype of the black superwoman who can do it all is absent here. It's often painful reading, but it also reveals the possibility of identification with the experiences found here. 'Longing To Tell' is poignant, sad and, at the same time, joyous and determined. The book often seems like a story told by a close friend and that is another reason why this book is so important. Black women's experiences around sexuality and intimacy are always rendered as fiction, myth, tabloid 'news' feature, or pathology *without* the voices of black women. Rose's book writes against that long, ugly tradition and lends dignity to black women's relation to sexuality and intimacy with no moral judgement rendered. In short, mandatory. If I could afford to, I'd buy this book for all of my friends."},{"Title":"Longing to Tell: Black Women's Stories of Sexuality and Intimacy","review":"Tricia Rose turns academic research into a literary masterpiece. She interviewed 20 African American females with various ethnic backgrounds, broad range of age, and socioeconomic upbringing. Rose organized the real life commentaries on sex, intimacy, relationships, and race into a narrative that will carry you through a broad range of emotions. The women speak truth to situations that happen in every day life but are considered taboo in the African American community.Rose starts the book with a discussion about the negative stereotypes in regards to sex and intimacy that are portrayed about the African American female in the media. The purpose of the book was developed as an attempt to answer the question, \\"how has the history of race, class, and gender inequality in this country affected the way that black women talk about their sexual lives?\\" Rose answered this question and much more. Longing to Tell is a mirror image of African American female sexuality in contemporary society as well as an oral history that serves as a vibrant presentation for everyday readers and scholars alike.The stories are captured and categorized into three different areas: Through the Fire; Guarded Heart; and Always Something Left to Love. The women, whose names and locations have been changed to protect their anonymity, openly discuss their sexual history; how they learned about sex, masturbation, orgasms, and experience of first menstruation, virginity, pregnancy, and motherhood; sexual abuse, rape, sexism, sexual fantasy and sexual orientation. Some of the tales in the book are horrendous such as incest, rape, domestic abuse and sexual harassment but while knocked down these women were not knocked out. Many tell about the love from friends, family and at times even the smiles of strangers brought them back from the depths of despair. The stories are all different and engaging as their experiences were dynamic while thought provoking. Does your definition of sexuality characterize how you live life?Longing To Tell is an extraordinary account on how African American women survive despite the incredible odds against them. As an adjunct professor of African American Studies, I highly recommend this book as a study into the mind of black women. As an avid reader, I strongly encourage you to read this book as a motivational guide on finding your way out of the struggle.

Modesty is a self-made millionaire (gained when she led a criminal network in her early 20s). She and Willie retired but found the quiet life didn't appeal and among other things, took jobs for the British Intelligence network. They are both experts in martial arts along with other various skills (lock picking, flying, parachuting, etc.)Silver Mistress concerns their actions to rescue Tarrant (head of Brit Intel and friend) from a gang of blackmailers. It contains one of the best fight sequences ever written, from whence the title comes. Modesty versus the bad martial artist.While this little review leaves so much unsaid, it is better than none at all. It is an excellent book -- one I've reread several times and if you like action books or female heroes, you can't miss it or any other Modesty Blaise books.

Modesty &amp; her sidekick/partner, Willie are off into danger once again, this time to save the life of an old friend. Peter O'Donnell has really outdone himself, in this tale of intrigue, gadgetry, &amp; oneupmanship! This tale is lighthearted and sexy throughout, but still leaves your stomach in a knot as the action continually gets hotter until the unexpected climax. Try it! You'll love it! I did"},{"Title":"The Silver Mistress","review":"\\"The Silver Mistress\\" is one of my favorite Modesty Blaise books because most of the action takes place in Southern France, around the Gorges du Tarn region and in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains. This is a part of the world that I know fairly well, and love, and that makes the story especially attractive for me.If I ignore this special personal appeal then this story is no longer among the best in the series, and that's why I'm only awarding four stars.\\"The Silver Mistress\\" was written by Peter O'Donnell in 1973, at a time when the Modesty Blaise phenomenon was still at its highest. It is the seventh book in the series and by now there were a large number of loyal fans who eagerly awaited each book with open arms.Unfortunately, \\"The Silver Mistress\\", together with \\"The Impossible Virgin\\" (1971), mark the beginning of the decline of the series. There would never again be another \\"A Taste for Death\\" (1969), the ultimate Modesty story that marked the high point.In many ways \\"The Silver Mistress\\" is a classical Modesty story. There are some really nasty bad guys, some with very surprising characteristics. Modesty and Willie Garvin (Modesty's loyal sidekick) get captured by the bad guys and have to break out of captivity. Some other non-combatant good guys are also held captive so Modesty and Willie have to take care of them as well when the final showdown occurs. And, of course, the bad guys get their just rewards, often in rather unexpected and gruesome ways.To start with the bad guys, the American Colonel Jim and his ridiculous wife, Lucy, make a scary/petulant pair - typical Peter O'Donnell creations. When Colonel Jim shows his wife how much he loves her by letting her choose the first of the captives to be killed we are both horrified and fascinated by this bizarre twist of human nature.The other secondary bad guys are similarly intriguing.Unfortunately, the top bad guy, Mr. Sexton, doesn't live up to his role. When the world's greatest unarmed combat fighter sets out to kill Modesty and Willie we should be terrified, but somehow Mr. Sexton never really comes alive, and remains an abstract threat rather than one we totally believe in. He's too perfect, and thus somewhat artificial.The story is fairly simple, with Tarrant (a close friend of Modesty and Willie) getting kidnapped by Colonel Jim and Mr. Sexton and being subjected to slow torture. When Modesty and Willie discover this they come to the rescue, only to get captured themselves, along with two others. Then Modesty and Willie have to break out and rescue Tarrant and the other two.Incidentally, the quote at the top of this review (\\"And anyway, 'e won't dare die on 'er, not the mood she's in now.\\") is Willie's comment regarding Tarrant's chances of surviving Modesty's chosen method of rescuing him from captivity. (pg 213)\\"The Silver Mistress\\" is not a great Modesty book, but it is above average. It has the usual qualities of the intelligent and humorous slant on things and the appeal of the unique relationship between Modesty and Willie.Among the not-so-great aspects is the problem of Mr. Sexton not being as serious a threat as he should be. There are also some plot problems, for example the silliness of Modesty inviting two other people, Lady Janet Gillam and Quinn, to join them on a caper. Of course this is a recipe for disaster, and if Willie really cared about Lady Janet he shouldn't have let Modesty do such a crazy thing.Other plot problems involve the stupidity of the bad guys staying put in their French chateau even after they know they've been blown, and an overly sugar-sweet ending.One thought-provoking aspect of reading or re-reading this book today is the relevance it has regarding airplane hijackings in the light of the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy. In the story Quinn was a copilot on an airplane that had been hijacked by terrorists, and he tells Modesty about his feelings at the time: \\"How dare you! How dare you threaten all these men and women and kids, you mindless maniacs!\\" (pg 117)Recommended, even after 30 years. (The first couple Modesty books are now 40 years old, and I'm still giving them five stars and a \\"highly recommended\\".)Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Silver Mistress","review":"One of the better of the later Modesty Blaise novels, this book expands on the relationship between Tarrant and Modesty and has a couple of villains who are more than the usual one-dimensional bad guys.

Padilla's study is set in Chicago and examines the structural conditions and social inequalities endured by Chicanos and Puerto Ricans in the Windy City throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s; these inequities fostered the emergence of a new Latino ethnic identity and mobilization in the 1970s that transcended individual Mexican and Puerto Rican identity.Padilla contends that a pan-ethnic Latino identity emerges when two or more Spanish-speaking ancestry populations are confronted with similar social conditions (such as poverty, discrimination, or poor educational facilities). Such conditions may serve as a basis for solidarity and unity between two or more Spanish-speaking groups (in this case Chicanos and Boricuas) as they unite to seek redress for such grievances. As the old saying goes, \\"there is strength in numbers.\\"Padilla points out that there are two basic models of Latinismo: the ascribed model and the emergent model. The ascribed model seeks ethnicity as a primordial category; Latinos constitute an a priori ethnic group based on Spanish as a cultural commonality. On the other hand, the emergent model and its adherents see Latino pan-ethnicity as a socially constructed concept that arises when Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, etc unite in efforts to challenge systematic inequalities that they face. Padilla clearly favors the emergent model, although he does not totally discard the ascribed framework - pointing out that many \\"Latinos\\" cherish Spanish as a key element of symbolic ethnicity.Padilla does a great job in detailing the emergence of a pan-Latino ethnic identity among Chicanos and Puerto Ricans in Chicago during the 1970s. The move towards a pan-Latino identity originated in the early 1970s when Mexicans and Puerto Ricans unitied to challenge discrimination in Chicago's white collar employment sector. Federal affirmative action policy enhanced efforts towards pan-Latino unity as it legitimized and confirmed claims of inequality and discrimination. The sucess of early efforts in opening up new job opportunities for Mexicans and Puerto Ricans was taken as proof that pan-Latino unity held promise in fighting racial and ethnic discrimination.Padilla's book is important because, all too often, larger American society uses the label \\"Latino\\" indiscriminately - implying that Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, etc. are automatically a unified, homogenous group. Nothing could be further from the truth. A homogenous \\"Latino\\" culture does not exist, cultural differences and differences in historical experiences mark each group that is encompassed under the rubric of \\"Latino.\\" Examing the experiences and social history of, for example, Puerto Ricans and labeling it as \\"Latino culture\\" or \\"Latino history\\" is misleading and a misnomer, as Puerto Rican experience in the United States is vastly different from Cuban experiences and Chicano experiences. Padilla argues that social scientists and the media must stop using the label \\"Latino\\" indiscriminately and realize that this pan-ethnic label is a political phenomenon that denotes a conscious attempt at inter-group unity to achieve a collective goal. As such, scholars should dedicate themselves to investigating the factors and conditions that serve to promote attempts at \\"Latino\\" unity.I strongly suggest reading this book in conjunction with \\"Latino Crossings\\" by Nicholas DeGenova and Ana Ramos-Zayas. While Padilla focuses on the conditions that foster pan-Latino unity, DeGenova and Ramos-Zayas examine factors that impede and prevent such unity (inter-group prejudice and stereotypes being the main culprit to such efforts)."},{"Title":"Elements of partial differential equations (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"Partial Differential Equations (PDE) is a very large field of mathematics. Most of the problems originated in the characterization of fields occurring in classical and modern physics such as potential and wave equations associated with gravitation, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.Some books in this subject are quite theoretical, and deal quite extensively with existence proofs such as the necessary and sufficient conditions required for a solution (Example: Courant Hilbert Methods of Mathematical Physics Volume 2, Petrovsky's Lecture on PDE or Sobolev's PDE of Mathematical Physics ), others are much more applied, and oriented towards explaining and illustrating various techniques, that can be used to solve various PDE (Example: Morse Fesbach's Methods of Theoretical Physics, Sommerfeld's PDE or Farlow's PDE for Scientists and Engineers).The author Ian Sneddon was an outstanding applied mathematician, whosemost outstanding book is Fourier Transform.The present book is a more modest book, as the title indicates it is an introduction. The book tends to be towards applied side of PDE, though itdevelops the subject using theorems and proofs (and examples). The content of the book is fairly standard, it overlaps with most other PDE books (equations of mathematical physics).It does not discuss extensively special functions (this topics can be found in many other books), though the reader is invited to get acquainted with these functions through solving problems at the end each chapter (Answers to odd number problems can be found at he end of the book.)Nor does it discuss the use of generalized functions to solve PDE (he book was written in 1957)There are some topics present, which are usually not included in other books on PDE. I found the discussion on Pfaffian differential equationand its application to Caratheodory's formulation for the 2nd law of thermodynamics enlightening (those who are familiar with differential forms (see Frankel's Geometry of Physics) may find the exposition somewhat old fashioned, but I think the underlying concept is still the same).The parts of the book I read, I found quite clear, but still requiring some patience in spite of the fact that I already knew about PDE from other books (in a rather haphazard manner)(there may not be a royal road to PDE)In summary, this is a sound introduction to PDE. It requires some patience to read, if you are only interested in solving PDE, you will probably find Farlow's better suited for your need."},{"Title":"Elements of partial differential equations (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"The chapter on first order partial differential equations is an excellent primer on examples of global integrability in dynamical systems theory (including but not restricted to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, driven-dissipative systems are implicitly included), although the word integrability is never mentioned.

The battle scenes are fast paced and so highly descriptive it feels that you are there fighting beside Ray Hunter. Although a work of fiction this book is a must read for anyone interested in the Rhodesian's fight against communism or for those that study counter insurgency actions. You will not be disappointed!!!!"},{"Title":"One Commando: Rhodesian Light Infantry","review":"Five stars does not do this book justice! \\"One Commando\\" was an outstanding autobiographical account of the Rhodesian Bush War, told from the eyes of a Rhodesian Light Infantryman. If you want a geopolitical dissertation, don't look here, but if you want a gritty account of what it was actually like fighting marxist terrorists in Southern Africa, this book has no equals. Interestingly, the book shatters the myth that the Soviet-backed insurgents were fighting a humanitarian \\"people's war\\" by graphically exposing the atrocities they committed against non-combatants of both colours. Gledhill also provides an illuminating look into the \\"fire force\\" tactics that allowed the vastly outnumbered Rhodesian army to decimate their foe.

The author has done a great job of blending what one may assume are his own experiences with the experiences of others, giving the reader a pretty good over all picture of what the war in Rhodesia was like. At times the \\"hero\\" seems a bit like a superman, but no more so than other heros in other books.This book is a fast read and I thourougly enjoyed reading it. I was a little dissappointed in that I when I purchased the book, I was under the impression I was getting a non-fiction book.

Nor does it specify some mythical &quot;one true strategy&quot; you should follow. What it does, and does very well, is cover the entire spectrum of larger strategy issues that will distinguish the greater success of strategic thinkers from the blind-luck results of simple tactical implementers.Who is this for? People who have read (or done) enough real estate that they don't need yet another book of the details. People who want (or need) to be reminded to think about the larger plan, where they are going, and how to optimize your strategy for best results. I'm a business strategist professionally, and I think this is well written and useful. Some of the people who appreciate it the least (&quot;just do it&quot; types who want to be handed simple answers) would benefit the most from this very good summary of real estate strategic thinking.

If I had read this book first, I think I would have kept my money in the bank. Eldred makes me feel that real estate investing is way too complicated to even start. Granted, there are those writers who make it seem all too easy, but Eldred throws up so many cautions as to scare the average investor away.He may tour the US giving seminars on investing, but the book seems to have been written for rich investors. He gives very little details on how to do a deal. He declines to outline his plan for the reason that every city is different. While this is in essence true, it would be helpful to an investor to have some plan, any plan upon which to start his or her real estate investing career.I did glean some info from it, but that was because I was interested in a very narrow sphere of real estate.

It talks about building wealth through investing in small income properties, and I think that this is one of the best books on the subject. By small income properties, the author means 2 to 24-unit apartment buildings. It teaches you how to find the right type of properties, how to finance them, and how to manage them. Investing in these properties provides advantages over investing in single-family homes or condominiums. For example, a ten-unit apartment property can be purchased for less per unit than a condominium of the same size in a similar location. That's why some investors convert apartments into condominiums because buying in bulk provides economies of scale. Other benefits that the author provides are higher cash flows, greater ease of management, and enhanced possibilities for creating value.While I like this book, I have to warn you that it lacks some specifics, so I would suggest that you also read other books on the subject, too.

His definitions and explanations of terms and of how one develops logical rules are excellent and explained very well.

In 1972 I took a course at the University of Illinois at Chicago and this was the book they used. The course, the professor, and this book changed my life (yes, really). I had been a business major, but I had a lot of elective units to burn. My counselor suggested \\"Introduction to Formal Logic\\". I loved it; I felt like I had come home.Fast forward a year and a half: I'm now a programmer looking for work in Silicon Valley. Because I had been involved with PLATO IV at the U of I, I was using the PLATO terminals at IMSSS (at Stanford) to IM with friends back home (that's right, kids, we had IM in ... 1974). Unbeknownst to me, IMSSS was the personal kingdom of one Dr. Patrick Suppes.A month later I was hired to work for Computer Curriculum Corporation, Dr. Suppes' company that sold Computer Assisted Instruction systems to schools all over the country. I worked there for 3 years and it was a great experience.Oh, the book! It's almost 40 years ago, but I still remember the book as presenting ideas -- new to me -- in a clear, almost sparse style. I did not know it at the time, but this is the essential voice of Dr. Suppes. I strongly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the logical underpinnings of deduction and argument.

Well, Suppes' Introduction to Logic is one of those rare specimens.I bought it looking for a book that could make my students think for themselves as well as getting excited by the wonderful subject which is logic (deductive reasoning). Its explanations are very clear and solid. The first part which covers propositional and first order logic is presented quite extensive and rigorous. The downside is that there is no metatheory, i.e. there are no proof of the important theorems. This could be understandable since the book has for primary audience first year undergraduates. Another downside of this book is that a large part of the exercises are very difficult to solve because the theory that preceeds them is not enough to know how to proceed. I mean this: at the end of every chapter there are exercises, the problem is that a great amount of these exercises require to know more theory than what is there.Part II, naive set theory, is delightful. The chapter on functions is just very stimulating. For anyone curious, without mathematical background, to know some set theory this part is suitable. It has one of the downsides of Part I, some exercises are not easy to solve since the theory given is not enough. Nevertheless, the presentation is quite good. Anyone interested in a rigorous set theory can buy the author's Axiomatic set theory.Even though I have mentioned some cons of Suppes' book, I still considered it as one of its kind. I mean, it may have no metalogic, but it is still a competent book."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"Now there are two readers' editions of Emily Dickinson's poems that are usable for close readings and scholarship. By usable, I mean that the texts--note the word \\"texts\\"--are close to what Emily Dickinson wanted them to be. The earlier Thomas H. Johnson text has been an acceptable and competent version since it was published in 1955. Johnson's readers' edition-the one without all the scholarly apparatus-contains 1775 poems. (In the same year Belknap Press of Harvard University Press issued his three-volume variorum of all the known poems.) This is cool. This new version of Emily Dickinson poems was edited by R.W. Franklin, and the readers' edition was published in 1999. It contains 1789 poems-unfortunately with a different numbering than Johnson--based, we are told, on probable date of composition. Franklin also edited a fresh variorum edition also published by Belknap Press of Harvard. I am boring you with all of this detail to tell you that although the Johnson texts are good texts if you are serious about Dickinson--meaning if you actually care about what she wrote on the page--the Franklin will give accurate texts and is the new authority. F.W. Franklin has been working since the '60's on details where Johnson perhaps lacked information and insight. He knows whereof he speaks, and he has done his utmost to reassemble Ms. Dickinson's original manuscripts in their proper order. Previous versions of the poems--those before Johnson and Franklin--regularized rhyme and otherwise abrogated the accuracy of the poems. They were cleaned up according to late 19th century standards, and the texts--despite editorial comments to the contrary--are corrupt. That means that they are inaccurate. In conclusion, if you want Emily Dickinson with accuracy--despite the rapturous testimony of some reviewers of other presentations of the poems--go for the Johnson or Franklin texts. Franklin is most current and should be impeccable. Other texts, including some that are in supposedly respectable American literature anthologies, may be suspect. (One of the most respectable uses texts that derive from late 19th century texts that were declared corrupt some 40 years ago.)"},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"Emily Dickinson finally has an edition of her poems that she fully deserves. As many readers know, many of her poems were left with variations in words and phrases. Sometimes, whole poems exist in completely different versions -- but the problem is that a &quot;final&quot; form for some poems is not as easy as it might seem since Dickinson herself left many variations on words and phrases without favouring a particular one! One could say that &quot;final&quot; versions for many of her poems simply do not exist. The Johnson edition (the old &quot;definitive&quot; edition) of the complete poems makes choices for the reader -- choices which, unfortunately, are not always the best. This new edition presents the poetry with all the variations intact, so that the reader could choose for him/herself a particular reading when Dickinson herself did not leave a final preference. This new edition is a *must* for anyone who loves Dickinson's poetry (such as myself) -- and it emphasizes just how rich and imaginative Dickinson's use of language really is. Dump your Johnson edition for recycling, folks. This is the definitive edition, worth every penny (and then some) of its rather high price."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"If you know Dickinson's compositional method -- with almost no publication in her lifetime, often with many versions of one poem, and with poetic significance altered by the paper and exact handwriting -- you will recognize that any printed edition of her work cannot be perfect. Still, Franklin has worked with care, intelligence, scholarship, and order on finding the best renditions of her poems, and these are those. If you learn to love her, you may want the hardback! Her \\"little\\" lyrics are a joy forever, and you may wear out your copy."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"READERS SHOULD NOTE that this is a review of the following THOMAS H. JOHNSON edition, and not of the R. W. Franklin 3-volume Variorum or other editions under which it has been mistakenly placed by Amazon (I have therefore added some comments about the Franklin at the end):Thomas H. Johnson, Editor. THE POEMS OF EMILY DICKINSON, INCLUDING VARIANT READINGS CRITICALLY COMPARED WITH ALL KNOWN MANUSCRIPTS. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass., and London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, nd. [A single-volume reprint of the original 1955 3-vol. edition]. ISBN 0-674-67601-7 HBK.Prior to the appearance of Johnson's great variorum edition of Emily Dickinson in 1955, an edition which was the first to offer readers accurate texts of her complete poems, it was not possible to arrive at a just estimation of her tremendous achievement, an achievement that places her at the forefront of the ranks of the world's greatest poets. Because of the highly idiosyncratic nature of her poems, all earlier editors had felt obliged, to some extent or other, and in order to make them more acceptable to the public, to normalize them by adding titles, smoothing her rhymes, changing words, regularizing punctuation, and relineating them; some editors even went so far as to remove entire stanzas. It becomes a tribute to the power of her poems that, despite this savage treament they somehow survived, and there are many readers, even today, who have grown to love these mutilated versions without ever realizing just how far removed they are from her originals.Although Johnson himself wasn't entirely free of the slash-and-burn approach to ED's texts - since he apparently felt that readers weren't yet ready for the peculiar lineation that we find in Emily Dickinson's own handwritten versions of the poems - he should nevertheless be credited with having brought the worst of it to an end, and for having given us texts that are closer to the originals than ever before. He is also to be credited with having established an approximate chronological order for the 1775 poems in his edition, and for having provided us with a convenient way of referring to these untitled poems by giving each of them a number, the well-known 'Johnson numbers' which are still standard today. Each numbered poem has been transcribed exactly as it is found in the manuscripts, though with his editorial choice of variant and with lineation normalized. Below each poem comes a list of variants, information about the poem's manuscript source/s, and its publication history. The poems are preceded by 70 pages of Introductory material, which include 20 pages of very interesting photographic facsimiles in illustration of ED's varied writing styles, and the book is rounded out with an Appendix, a Subject Index, and an Index of First Lines.The single-volume version is an undated reprint of the original 1955 3-volume edition, and is a substantial book of over 1300 pages weighing in at a hefty 4lbs plus. Given the fantastic price of the book, I was amazed to discover that, although bound in full cloth, instead of the pages being sewn in signatures it has been given a glued spine which is nowhere near strong enough to hold the weight of all these pages. Although I'm pretty careful with books, the brand-new copy I examined split at the spine the first time I opened it. Anyone who is interested in the Johnson variorum would be well advised to search for a copy of the much better produced earlier and stitched 3-volume version. Although the present book deserves more than 5 stars for its content, it deserves far less for its poor physical makeup.As a contribution to scholarship, Johnson's variorum was a magnificent achievement for its time, and helped greatly in establishing Emily Dickinson's reputation. But much has come to light since 1955, and R. W. Franklin's richer 1998 variorum (which unlike the Johnson provides details of the original lineation) may now be said to have superseded it. Details of the Franklin variorum are as follows:R. W. Franklin, Editor. THE POEMS OF EMILY DICKINSON : VARIORUM EDITION. 3 vols. Cambridge, Mass., and London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-674-67622X HBK.R. W. FRANKLIN'S 3-volume Variorum differs from Thomas H. Johnson's earlier 1955 Variorum in essential ways, but most significantly in that it has added 14 poems to the total corpus, thereby bringing the total from Johnson's 1,775 to 1,789 poems. This, and the re-dating of certain poems whose dates could never be established with certainty, has led to a re-numbering of the poems which, although a Franklin-to-Johnson number conversion table is included, is very inconvenient since most writing about Emily Dickinson remains keyed to Johnson's earlier numbering.Franklin's scholarly apparatus is extremely technical, and his approach throughout is thoroughly scientific, with one significant exception: all poems have been normalized (i.e., ED's own lineation has been ignored). As a substitute for the original shapes of the poems, footnotes indicating \\"Division\\" (line-breaks) have been given. Consequently, reconstructing the original shape of the poems in one's mind can be rather tiresome since it requires constant recourse to the Division notes.Despite these two weaknesses, however, the Franklin, with its accurate texts and full scholarly apparatus which gives provenance, notes indicating line-breaks, variants, publishing history, etc., is an impressive achievement and as as essential reference work it will undoubtedly find many important uses. The three volumes are beautifully produced, bound in half cloth, stitched for durability, well-printed on excellent paper, and a joy to handle."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"The readers' edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson provides a condensed and affordable alternative to the three-volume variorum edition, also published by Belknap. It contains the same number of poems, but omits the alternate versions and contextual notes Franklin includes in the variorum. I prefer this edition of Dickinson's poetry to the 1955 edition edited by Thomas Johnson because it includes several poems the earlier one didn't, and because Franklin seems to have a better handle on transcribing Emily Dickinson's sometimes confusing handwriting than Johnson did. This collection is a good acquisition for anyone planning to study Dickinson, or anyone who wants to read her poems in their original, non-Victorianized form. Her original spelling and punctuation lend even more character to her already intriguing poems, so reading them this way is an experience I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who LOVES Emily Dickinson. Although it does not contain all the different versions of her poems, it is comprehensively edited to have the version of each known poem that is believed to be Dickinson's most complete and revised. This edition also seem to have the most complete collection of poems--1,789-- compared to the other &quot;complete poems&quot;. However, if you are looking for an edition for studious reasons, this edition does have different numbering for the poems than the ones usually used (the editor claims them to be in the most accurate chronological order possible).The binding of this book is VERY nice and has its own ribbon for marking pages. Definitely a nice book."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"Amazon is doing a bait-and-switch on the Kindle edition of this. You don't get the Franklin Reading Edition--instead you get a cheaply made version of a 1955 Edition of Dickinson. DON'T BUY THIS!

It's shoddy practice and should be criminal, if it isn't."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"I was excited (not to mention naive) to think I could get the Franklin ed. of Dickinson's poetry for a mere 99 cents. But then I saw that the ed. is only the old Todd-Higginson, which is free elsewhere. I would pay, say, 10 bucks for the Franklin, but it's apparently not available for Kindle. Shame. Neither is the slightly less authoritative Johnson ed. from the '50s. It's sad that, by and large, the Dickinson most people read and have read--in books, websites, and now e-readers--is bad versions of her poetry. Emily liked the dashes above all, and Higginson, among others, arrogantly \\"corrected\\" Emily's poetry for her, since she was not a \\"professional poet.\\" Well, no one needs (or needed) to \\"correct\\" Dickinson's poems for her. They are very great, almost all 1800 of them. They are little gems, filled with wonder, elliptical diction, symbols that work in multiple ways, doubts, love for nature, love for love, and a great working knowledge of the ideas (and pop culture) of her day.

There's an earlier definitive Johnson collection, but I went with the Franklin collection because it's the latest and widely praised by scholars.All the poems are here, with the \\"spasmodic gait,\\" irregular syntax, personal spellings, cranky capitalizations and passionate punctuation that distressed the poet's stodgy literary mentor T. W. Higginson and caused Dickinson's earliest editors to get out their red pencils.Franklin has banished all the misguided corrections and tidying up perpetrated by the original editors and restored the true voice of the poet in all its eccentricity and power.The typesetting of the poems is clear, unpretentious and very readable.I found this authoritative collection a perfect complement to the scholarly biography of Emily Dickinson by Richard Sewall."},{"Title":"Poems of Emily Dickinson","review":"This is it!!

I've spent hours at a time flipping through it and reading random poems. They're organized chronologically, and their numbers are off to the side in the margin so as to be unobtrusive. Since Dickinson's original punctuation, spelling, and formatting are preserved, it feels like you're really reading something close to what she intended the poems to be. Detailed textual citations (the particular choices that Franklin decided on when compiling this edition, since Dickinson had multiple versions of some poems) as well as a distribution by year and a first-line index are all at the back.This is definitely the only way I will read Dickinson's poems ever again. Franklin is considered to be one of the most definitive editions of her poetry, and this book has every single poem with one reading for each poem.

First, that motto of comedy that Kallan might take as his own: Castigat Ridendo Mores (It Chastises our Ways through Laughter). Only, I am not sure that Rich Kallan wants to chastise anyone or anything. He prefers to exercise his sense of humor with a conspiratorial wink in our direction, as we tap out our PIN number on the ATM machine.So, perhaps, the Horace-based words Bis Repetita Placent (Things Twice Repeated Please) would confirm him in his conviction that tautologies will continue to flourish.The illustrations alone are worth the price of the book.

This was a gift that I've come to appreciate the more it's made me laugh, but also by what I've come to learn.Have you ever said \\"sudden impulse\\" or \\"temporary loan,\\" or heard \\"the honest truth\\" or \\"an overused clich&eacute;?\\" Well I can no longer listen to radio or TV or read or write without being aware of tautologies that we hear and say everyday and also see in newspapers, magazines and, otherwise, well-written books.If you write, this book will make you much more aware of your writing, which will become tighter and cleaner, by no longer being polluted with repetitive constructs.Dr. Kallan's comments can be very funny as they illustrate how ridiculous our tautologies can be when understood literally. Often, they literally mean something very different than intended, and that's when the book is at its best. I go to bed each night with a smile."},{"Title":"Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies","review":"This work is entertaining as well as helpful to any writer, especially one concerned about redundancies.

I found myself laughing numerous times, and really thinking about the ridiculous nonsense contained within! Great, lighthearted read!"},{"Title":"Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies","review":"I read this effort with combined amusement and horror, horror as I counted up the ones I've probably used on occasion. Of course, my uses always had some point. Didn't they? Perhaps it's just denial talking.With one exception. I'll never accept 'inflammable' as redundant. What we have here are the half-literate come full circle to bite the fully literate in the tail. Or perhaps it's merely more evidence, were any needed, the time has come for those with classical educations to give up and go extinct.My general criticism is that the list of redundancies seems padded. Would anybody really say, \\"New beginner\\"? Okay, someone might, but no one motivated to buy this book. There are many of that kind. Other examples, such as \\"Sworn affidavit,\\" have technical meanings that are pretty much their only use.Still, it's a good effort. The fight against flabby thinking is never-ending. This is certainly a well-meaning salvo in the war."},{"Title":"Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies","review":"Unless this book is to be an indictment of language in general, and the English language in particular, he should have worked a bit more on methodological considerations. Many of the redundancies included are unwarranted, e. g. &#34;soft whisper&#34;. The word &#34;whisper&#34; certainly does carry connotations of quietness, but there are many varying degrees of softness with which one might whisper, clarifying it can add a desired quality to an account.I also take issue with complaints against redundancies involving prepositions. (e. g. enter in, falling down, et al) Not only is this sort of construction common in practically every language, alive or dead, but the prepositions are really serving a purpose, generally an indicative one. Prepositions are quite fluid sorts of words, all depending on what perspective the speaker wishes to adopt in his expressions, and can become redundant or explanatory based on context. They are not, strictly speaking, repetatively redundant tautologies.Of course, that said, the book is free and fun.

It was quite short, which was something of a relief, as I found it got just a bit tedious after the first dozen pages or so. It took me less than an hour to finish. I didn't time it, so I can't tell you how much less.Don't get me wrong, it's quite well-written, and it is exactly as advertised. It's just too much of the same type thing. The author would come up with a redundant phrase (isn't there a word for a phrase of two words?), and plug it into his formula for description and close relatives.I learned a few things about these fun language hiccups, but it is put together more like an academic paper and less like something that would be fun to read.

Stemming from a BBC TV series script idea, Sandi Toksvig, a comedienne is paired with a student-days friend John McCarthy, an author and journalist who was held captive by Islamic extremists for 5 years in Lebanon, to sail in a wooden cutter around the British Isles. References to the fact that neither of the \\"intrepid\\" voyagers had any previous sailing experience puzzled, as the trip was to be undertaken in an eighty odd year old Bristol Pilot Boat, a Gaff Cutter, Hirta, with an eight-foot draft and two novices actually sailing her safely among the rocks of the British coast did indeed, as the subtitle says, seem improbable.And so it would have been except, as we learn, that one of Britain's most experienced Sailing Instructors and yachtsmen being the owner and Skipper of Hirta went along too, and he was accompanied by another experienced former-owner on board as Mate. Later, with a crew change, the Captain's equally experienced wife and daughter - with several Trans-Atlantic crossings to their credit - come along with our two greenhorns. Oh! ...and a producer, director, cameraman, sound technician .... Intrepid?!Well at least the book is enjoyably well written, jointly, alternatively and equally by both voyagers, describing their growing competence as sailors as they learn the ropes, the shouted orders meanings and the ways of the sea. Having recently read Professor David Moore's \\"The Other British Isles\\" it was a pleasant comparison to read these two voyagers light sketches of many of the same islands and ports that Moore describes with profound history.The humorous snippets (and we can guess who they are from) are a delight too, we are informed that it is not very seamanlike to stand on the same rope that another is hauling, that if you lean on the hub of the steering wheel you find a type of grease on your jeans \`that never comes out' and that the correct way to eat a Cornish Pasty is to hold onto the rib and eat the rest before discarding the now grubby rib!This book is a pleasant romp around the British coast and a revelation of a deep, firm and mutually enjoyed friendship."},{"Title":"Journey Not Chosen...

Destination Not Know: Living with Bipolar","review":"I purchased this book because there is a family history of this illness. I was not prepared as to how powerful it would be. The mother's story is heartbreaking and a great account for those who are also beginning the journey of helping a loved one. Thank goodness Kristy's mom was so persistant in getting help and that Kristy herself is following the program and doing well. Unfortunately this is not the case for a lot of people. This is a must read for anyone who is dealing with someone with this illness."},{"Title":"Journey Not Chosen... Destination Not Know: Living with Bipolar","review":"I found this to be a fairly enjoyable, quick read about battling bipolar disorder. The quality of writing is pretty good and the story inspires empathy in the reader. Like another reviewer said, it did have a little too much God in it for my taste. Nonetheless, it makes a significant contribution to the genre of mental illness memoirs and is worth reading if you suffer from bipolar disorder or know someone who does. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Journey Not Chosen... Destination Not Know: Living with Bipolar","review":"There are two first-person accounts in this book: that of a mother whose young-adult daughter begins to manifest baffling, frightening behavior and that of the young woman, herself. These were written relatively soon after the young woman began treatment, and the searing descriptions will resonate with many who have been confused and afraid in the early stages of grappling with bipolar disorder.Beyond the personal story, the primary author (the mother) extends this short, very readable book to describe bipolar's symptoms and its management. There is a fairly extensive glossary, a list of resources, and an appendix about obtaining the very expensive medications, when required, for people with limited incomes and no health insurance.The book is written quite simply, by contrast to many more technical books on the subject. People who are just beginning to grapple with the impact of bipolar disorder will find the text blessedly free of jargon and easy to understand. You might well go on to other sources, but this is a fine place to start to get one's bearings and some hope."},{"Title":"Journey Not Chosen... Destination Not Know: Living with Bipolar","review":"As a bipolar person I found that 21-year-old Kristy's account of her illness to be startlingly accurate and her mother's account very poignant. My only issue is with the emphasis they both place on god. They are quite obviously a very religious family (regular catholic church goers; Kristy attended a catholic high school, dad worked there). As a non-religious and non-spiritual person I found it somewhat annoying, as I could not relate on that level at all and have no desire to. Granted, most of Kristy's delusions were religion-based (she frequently thought she was jesus christ and fervently worked at copying the bible word for word), still, I found myself rolling my eyes occasionally. Don't get me wrong, if nothing else this VERY quick read would make sufferers and care givers feel that someone out there is battling the same demons, but beware of god."},{"Title":"Journey Not Chosen... Destination Not Know: Living with Bipolar","review":"This is one story- powerfully written by mother and daughter. But every case is unique to the person/family experiencing it. I agree with another reviewer-- I did not connect with the emphasis on God.. but I don't criticize it-- because it is their honest personal experience. They cannot change that. Not everyone is anchored so deeply into God that it is where they must necessarily go. It was, however, just a speculation. And a plausible one-- for MANY but not all. I enjoyed the inclusion of an appendix. It was very helpful. There was a brief mention of TYPE I and TYPE II in the book but it was lacking detail and I wished it would have been a bit more fleshed out. Not everyone is relegated to having the TYPE I (more severe form) and knowing there are differences may help educate people and additionally may reduce the stigma. Overall a good honest account. It would be nice if there were a collection of accounts so people could see the wide spectrum of experiences."},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"I read this book in two days ~~ I couldn't put it down. John Jake focuses on Philip Kent again and this time, introduces a new character, a dissolute drunkard from the Virginian plantation families ~~ Judson Fletcher. Philip is sent to the front to fight while his wife, Anne, stays behind with their son. Judson meanders between his father's plantation, and Philadelphia and Richmond.This book is more intense on the war ~~ describing the conditions of Valley Forge where the men encamped for a bitter winter. They describe more battle scenes that makes you feel like you're right there having a sunstroke with the men. It gives you a glimpse of the hardships these men fought, despaired over and died for. Like Paine said, \\"These are the times that try a man's soul.\\" It's not exactly a wonderful read but the author wasn't too brutal in describing the wartime scenes.And it's a reminder of what the men of the Revolution fought for.It is a good book ~~ perfect for those long winter nights. If you like history and fiction, this book is among the best combination of the two!12-20-04"},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"This is an interesting and compelling read, and a necessary part of the Kent family chronicles. It's kind of a bummer, though, as absolutely nothing good happens to anyone for over 500 pages.

His books read fast and have plenty of action and melodrama (kind of like he wrote them with a miniseries in mind...hmm...). They're just trashy enough that you feel like you're having fun, and just historical enough that you feel like you're learning something. I loved the North and South miniseries, and I loved the Crown family books.

True, \\"The Rebels\\" was not quite as good as \\"The Bastard\\", but it is still stock full of twists and turns. Some of the battle scenes were a little gory, however John Jakes has a knack for making the reader keep turning pages. This is one of those books that is hard, if not impossible, to put down. John Jakes really develops his characters, you feel for them. Between the stories of Judson Fletcher and Phillip Kent, you get wrapped up and forget where you are. You truly feel like you are learning something when you read \\"The Rebels,\\" but it is not like listening to a grandparent drone on about \\"their day\\". John Jakes manages to juggle fun and learning perfectly. \\"The Rebels\\" is a lovable and important part of the American Bicentennial Series by John Jakes.

I like how they shoed the coldness of the winters to the fighters and the harsh reality of war but the battel scences were long.

Then there is Philips wife I was sad to see her outcome in the novel but enjoyed that part of the book. Very good characters in this book and I cant wait to read the next."},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"I love works on the American Revolution so I decided to read The Bastard and The Rebels as a 2 series book, as the rest of the Kent Chronicles have no interest for me at all.I loved the bastard (4 out of 5 stars)Yes it was cheesy with its high melodrama (Alicia and Roger just happening to show up at a wim was pretty juvenile) But the story was intense and Phillipe was a BACKDROP to historical events.The Rebel is a different story. The fictional characters take over, leaving the history of the era largely to discussion between them. This is disapointing. The historical aspects of Jakes novels are a strong point in otherwise infantile prose.The character of Judson Fletcher is so ridiculously drawn that he is in no way redeemable or loathsome....really 7th grade writing at this point.Overall I give the Rebel 3/5 for at least discussing interesting topics.If you really are into the revolution Jeff Sharra's 2 book series is much better.

Just finished reading this well written book by John Jakes, which transported me into the middle of the War of Independence.

Philip feels the call to serve his birthing country (firmly established in the first book -- a call certainly prodded by his wife's Revolutionary resolve) and spends almost all of this book on the battlefield. Soldiering is a tough trade, and Jakes captures it in brutal detail as he weaves the tales of Philip and the men with whom he serves.But there's another story in this book -- a big one -- and Jakes runs it parallel to Philip's story through the whole 533 pages of my '70s paperback edition. This is the story of Judson Fletcher, a troubled man born of a privileged Virginia plantation. He's heavy on the drinking, self-loathing and otherwise obnoxious behavior, but there's a strange sense of levelheadedness about him -- as well as a crushing desire to do better -- that's remarkably compelling. I admit wanting to skip over Philip's battle scenes to the alternating chapters featuring Judson as he sputters and starts in his search for some sense of purpose. I couldn't get enough of the guy. In fact, I read most of this book wondering who plays him in the '70s TV adaptation of this book, which a friend had given me on DVD but which I was patiently waiting to watch after I finished the book. I peeked at the IMDb: a pre-\\"Miami Vice\\" Don Johnson. Hmmmm. I figured Johnson had big shoes to fill, because as far as I was concerned, Judson Fletcher downright steals this book.Then I watched the miniseries. Ugh. I appreciated the fact that Johnson's Judson is appropriately stern and self-assured (when sober, at least), but I was disappointed that the TV adaptation basically throws the events of this book out the window. There are too many story differences to list here, and that's another review, anyway. At least both the print and screen version end up in the same place ...But back to the book! It was a great story, though heartbreaking for many of the characters. Jakes' technique of running the action parallel but separate for the two men might seem a little strange but is wholly forgiven: At the very end he brings it all together in a nice way, connecting their two lives unmistakably and setting things up superbly for the future of the series."},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"I read the Kent Family Chronicles a LONG time ago, but I loved every one of them...I thought they were great for portraying history.I enjoyed the family as they continued through all the books...I may have to re-read them some day"},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"A very well written book which I will recommend to anyone who reads."},{"Title":"the rebels","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining,first and foremost.

His story is intertwined in the story of Judson Fletcher, who must battle his own shortcomings, including a drinking problem, more than other soldiers.

Note that one person caused this triggering event by an insane act of terror and murder....Now, fast-forward to the early 1980's and the growing tensions between America and the Soviet Union. Just as the harsh words and saber-rattling reached a new high, the gravely ill leader of the Soviet Union died and a new leader was chosen to take his place. Fearful of the war talk between her nation and another, young Samantha Smith asked her Mother to write a letter to the new Soviet leader. When her Mom suggested to Samantha that she sit down and write of what was in her heart to the new Soviet leader herself, young Samantha did just that, thus setting a series of events in motion that changed our world forever in leading us from the brink of war to a lasting peace that has remained unbroken to this day....Samantha Smith's visit to the Soviet Union was a defining event in world history...things were never the same between America and the Soviet Union after her journey. The warlike words ceased between our nations and the good-will and peace in one little girl's heart triumphed over the fear, mistrust, and suspicion that had dominated relationships between the two nations for many decades before her visit. Whatever results people thought her visit might produce, they could never have imagined in their wildest dreams the incredible impact and historical significance that her vist would generate...such impact that is still evident in the early Twenty-First Century!There wasn't a shooting war between America and the Soviet Union in the 1980's, and when the Soviet Union broke up it did so in a peaceful manner that at one time would have been thought to be impossible. Even today, decades after her tragic death in a commercial airline crash, Samantha Smith is loved and remembered by the Russian people and those of the new nations of the former Soviet Union, as well as in America and throughout the world. Her influence and message of peace and love touch those of today as profoundly as back in the 1980's, and those who pray that the nations and peoples of the world might live in peace as one will never forget her and how she changed our world for the better.--- John Michael O'Loughlin"},{"Title":"Journey to the Soviet Union","review":"This is the original book by the young Samantha Smith and her father, Arthur Smith, about her family's trip to the Soviet Union on the invitiation of Yuri Andropov.

These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

Yes, just a Dorian's body defied time, this book is equally as powerful a metaphor today as it was when it was first written.

Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so.

I bought it and shelfed it for awhile until one day I picked it up and was subjected to its enchanting content. When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century.

The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly. The man got jailed for this book and boy was it worth it!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm surprised no one has actually managed to portray this books correctly. It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England. The only rough spot is chapter 11, which can easily be skimmed over. My best guess is that it all would have been fascinating to Wildes contemporaries, but is somewhat meaningless in this age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would happily listen to Edward Petherbridge read a telephone book but he truly does make this a very enjoyable book to listen to.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie based on the other reviews, and found it to be a good read.

I'm even more pleased with the quality of the freebies available."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded by modern science fiction conventions (ala The Twilight Zone), but I felt Dorian Gray ended predictably. Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now. Very well written and a wonderful Gothic classic. This freebie is worth downloading. The devil seems to be none other than his so-called friend who points out some truths to the shallow Dorian. That begins his unravelling. I won't be commissioning any portraits of myself - ever! (Reviewed from my Kindle 2)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The tricky plot, the accurate psychological analysis, the theme of the double, of pleasure and sin make this novel still an up-to-date one and I was really fascinated by the scheming protagonist who, in a way or in another, can be told to represent the human being in all his aspects. Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \\"successful\\".

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel. It is worth reading. It is worth buying. I wish I had read this when I was younger. This is one book I will give to my children. If I could, I would make this a part of highschool litterature versus many other pieces we were given to read. It is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance!

READ IT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read.

I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading.

So he gave away his soul in order to have eternal youth,so no matter what happened nothing would happen to him and the portrait would grow old instead. Later he goes insane and kills...

It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book. However, if a tree was cut for your book rest assured, the tree would be happy because Dorian is very pretty!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have recently read this book as part of my A-level syllabus and found it little more than an excuse for Wilde to voice his egotistical and condemnatory views of Victorian society.

While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"sdfj dsljf asdfjksl sadf lsdjf al asdl sjdsl flasdf fl. fsdjls,..f lf fdjfdsl. dsdfjs.. eoweoiwiew wwed vfrd vmri riejkfn fkjei fjf"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary.

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace. Most of the time I chuckled as I saw \\"Just Jack\\" with Jack doing his jazz hands as I read. The main appeal of this story is when it was written. So here is the thing...horror NO.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.

As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought.

Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption.

I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions.

I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art.

In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.

Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

It's quick, it's short, it's exciting, it's thrilling, it's very well written and it's a good summer read - I promise."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is set in London, England. This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history. Though his stories are not too long they embark on psychological journeys you won't want to miss.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process. It was very good and I advise as many people as possible to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A great classic. It's better the second or third time.Dorian Gray, a fabulously good-looking young man with a poetic glow about him, starts out innocent and pure. His more worldly acquaintances spoil him with many observations on how wonderful it must be to be young and fabulously handsome.Reflecting on his own beauty in an amazingly like portrait of himself, his obsession becomes never growing old. The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish. Now only the portrait will show the effects of age. And the stains on his character.For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty. All the other important things in life fall away. Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering. Neither does he.There are some passages that might appear wordy. There are many moving and inspiring passages, if one takes the time to reflect on them.This is a great book. Your teenager will probably be assigned to read it in middle-school or high school; you should read it too."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is a classic novel suffused with intriguing philosophies along with discrete ethical lessons.

The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious. &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"that would be the ideal way to describe Dorian Gray - an impressionable young Adonis on his Hedonistic quest for a life which itself is a work of art. Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual.

After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos. Wilde era un alien&iacute;gena en un mundo que no fue constru&iacute;do para &eacute;l.Despu&eacute;s de leer esta novela corta (o cuento largo, como prefieran) uno se queda con la impresi&oacute;n que Oscar Wilde la escribi&oacute; mirando su futuro en una bola de cristal porque es impresionante la similitud con muchas cosas que le ocurrieron mucho tiempo despu&eacute;s que &quot;El Retrato de Dorian Gray&quot; sea publicado; cumpli&eacute;ndose lo que &eacute;l mismo escribi&oacute; en uno de sus ensayos: &quot;La Vida imita al arte ..., en tanto que el arte es la realidad&quot;.La historia muestra a un Lord Henry Wotton enamorado de la belleza juvenil de Dorian y no ver&iacute;a mejor forma de demostr&aacute;rselo que retrat&aacute;ndolo en un lienzo para perpetuar su belleza. Lo sorprendente es que de manera inexplicable el retrato iba reflejando la vida de Dorian, como si tuviera vida propia y convirti&eacute;ndose en su conciencia que le recordaba cada d&iacute;a la vida desordenada en la que se hab&iacute;a sumergido. Conciente de esto Dorian, en un momento de ira, arremete contra su creador, Lord Henry, y se convierte en un deicida; de esta manera evitar&iacute;a que Lord Henry revelara su secreto a la sociedad que lo se&ntilde;alar&iacute;a con su dedo acusador. Sin embargo, su intento por borrar su pasado turbulento lo llevar&iacute;a a enfrentarse a aquel retrato que envejec&iacute;a paralelamente a como envejec&iacute;a su alma. Pero al arremeter contra este Dorian se dar&iacute;a cuenta que el no era m&aacute;s que el reflejo de aquel retrato y que en realidad era este quien decidia sobre su vida, incluso sobre su muerte. &quot;La Vida imita el Arte&quot; ... me repito una y otra vez y despierto en la realidad de las mentiras pensando en el otro &quot;yo&quot; que vive libre al otro lado de mi retrato ... Excelente historia."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\"Dorian Gray is a young Englishman who has it all - incredibly good looks, he is rich and favored by everybody, but bad companions encourage the worst in him. A good friend of his paints his portrait. Dorian Gray sees it and makes a wish not possible - to stay youthful forever. He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture. Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife. Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous. Dorian tries to repent in the end and stabs the picture and the picture returns to how it was at the start, and the hideousness of it that tells who he has become shows on him at last. He has stabbed at it and at himself, so he dies repenting.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my favorite book over the summer because it was easy to read and easy to get into. I also liked the pictures in the book. I thought the storyline was great and loved the ending.I think that the one who would really like this book as much as me would be my sister, Breena because I know what she likes and she takes my judgement on books as I take hers. She was the first one that introduced me to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because she is four years older than me."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],x={key:0},G={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",G,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-7e0f3f83"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/20.md","filePath":"guide/20.md"}'),W={name:"guide/20.md"},R=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{L as __pageData,R as default};
