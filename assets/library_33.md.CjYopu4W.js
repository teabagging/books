You will have trouble putting it down."},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"After witnessing the death of her employer, Governess Deborah Weyman knows the identity of the murderer and whisks her ward Quentin away to safety. Knowing that the murderer, John Gray, the Earl of Kendal, is named Quentin's guardian Deborah must do everything in her power to protect him.Gray knows he must do something drastic to find Miss Weyman and get Quentin away from his kidnapper. Unknown to him that Deborah believes he is the murderer, he devises a plan to kidnap Deborah and force her to inform his of Quentin's whereabouts. What he didn't expect was for the elderly governess to turn into a beautiful swan.After realizing her mistake Deborah goes along with Gray's plan to catch her former employer's murderer. But can she keep her own secrets safe while falling deeply in love with Gray?After reading WHISPER HIS NAME and STRANGERS AT DAWN I decided to go back and read an older book by Elizabeth Thornton. Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed. A good read but not up to par with her newest works"},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"A wonderful story developed by a master, Elizabeth Thornton. Excellent plot, cast of characters and romance. You will come to love Gray and Deborah. Their story carries both a romance and suspense, without taking away from each other. The story is well established, the character development is superb and the pace of the story is perfect. You find yourself saying...only one more chapter and then she teases you into reading the whole book at one sitting!She introduces a small cast of supporting roles, who in my opinion should have their own stories. Somehow, Ms. Thornton has introduced them so successfully that it only adds and does not distract from the main characters.Ms. Thornton writes a superior romance, it is sheer agony to wait a year for each new release! I have read this book from cover to cover four times and have thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"Oh yes, kidnapping and near rape is great for romance. (NOT.) She's a twit, he's an autocratic pig, they spent most of the time bickering, he did some shocking stuff that made it really hard to like him at all...I can't see what the fuss is with this author."},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"Deborah Weyman had been running for so many years - always running it seemed so that when she met the handsome, kind and unassuming Mr. Grey she thanked her lucky stars for the respite and knew that she could finally rest for a little while from the notorious Lord Kendal whom she had every reason to believe had murdered her former employer. Mr. Grey, now here was a man she could trust - so gentle and considerate of her every comfort as he transported her to his home near the town of Wells. It was the answer to her prayer as it was there in Wells, that she had brought her young ward, Quentin, to keep him safe from his father's murderer until she could find a safe place for them both. It wasn't long before a chance meeting led her to discover that her \`savior' Mr. Grey was actually John Grayson, Earl of Kendal the very man she was running from.After her attempt to escape, she was brought to house where Grey and company did their best to \`break' her into revealing where she had hid Quentin. Even though he was acting beastly, Deborah could not help her physical attraction to Gray, nor his to her even though he thought she was an accomplice to the murder. Once they came to the realization that they were both on the same side and Quentin's welfare was for both of them their utmost concern they began to work together to try to trap the real murderer while the passion that they were feeling for each other sizzled beneath the surface.As if finding a murderer wasn't mystery enough, Gray had to find out who Deborah really was and what else she was running from, before they could ever find a way to find each other.Again and again, I find this author comes up with another completely enthralling read - gallant, brave and honorable heroes - brave and resourceful heroines and wonderfully colorful and complex secondary characters to keep the pages from ever getting dull. Top it off with passionate love scenes and exciting suspense with a historical background and you have this reader hooked! From beginning to end this was a marvelous story that will keep you up all night long."},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"The beginning of this book was very good and had me hooked up in a moment. After a while, however, the book grew tedious. All the fuss about the murder becomes boring. And I didn't like Quentin and all his whining. Some of the love scenes are forced and not enjoyable at all. Gray and Deb couldn't decide whether they wanted to be together or not. And the kidnapping in the end was just over the top."},{"Title":"Dangerous to Kiss","review":"A great book from a great storyteller. An exciting beginning to this story pulls you in and doesn't let go. A mystery which you will not figure out until the end. A sexy hero and spunky heroine, great sexual tension and love story. For a change the hero falls in love first. Not the same old same old. Wonderful! A keeper! Try Liz Carlyle, Emma Jensen and Karyn Monk for more exciting reading."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"The Way of the World takes me back to when a generation traveled the world with backpacks, motorcycles and VW buses.It is a travel log set in the late fifties, of two casual travelers in their early twenties, who set off on a trip from Europe to India to explore the backroads and see life in its essence as lived by the local people.The book paints the pictures of gypsys, artists, mountain families and ancient cities with bazaars, using local color and the eye of an artist.Those who have traveled with similiar resources will enjoy the challenges of the innovative repair of an old Fiat in the middle of a desert, the capricousness of venturing into another country with only pocketchange, and the discovery that most people in the world do have a love of strangers."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"I envy him. I envy his travels and his writing. For me Bouvier writes the best travel novels. It s something different. He doesn't describe the country. he simply lives country's life. Stays somewhere in Anatolia for a month, then suddenly one day decides it is time. Time to go, time to travel."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"A remarkable little book that doesn't fit any category.It is hardly a travel essay. Bouvier gives no overview of the cultures he visits. His descriptions of sites and scenes are often minimal.Nor is it a chronicle of a personal journey. Bouvier provides little internal monologue. Although he occasionally makes philosophical pronouncements, his tone is distanced and impersonal, curious and objective. He looks outward, not inward.It reads more like a series of impressionistic short stories. I enjoyed most the literary snapshots of people in the 1950s in Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. Against a remote backdrop of religious extremism, bribe-taking officials, and tyranny in one form or another, Bouvier finds individuals who love life, seek pleasure, chase irrational dreams, and give unselfishly to needy travelers. More than anything else, it is a book about hospitality in an inhospitable world."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"The setting for the book is this lengthy road trip from Europe to the Khyber Pass back in the 50s. I did a similar trip in 1970.The strength of the writing is all in the understanding and insightful nature of the descriptions of the daily doings. It's not exciting or hair-raising, though certainly it held my interest throughout. Quite a few times I read a paragraph where I stopped and commented to my sister or wife, \\"Listen to this\\". And then just read aloud that snippet.The author and his buddy were a journalist and an artist taking a year long journey in a small and problem prone Fiat auto of the time. And stopping in towns where they would stay for a night or a couple weeks or even longer. They were trying to raise money from their work as they went along. Everybody understands that need, so they were on a more level footing with those who they encountered.This is certainly a fine book, and I'd recommend it to any thoughtful person."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"I bought this book on the strength of it having an introduction written by a favourite author, Patrick Leigh Fermor. Lke Fermor's \\"Time of Gifts\\", \\"The Way of the world\\" is a road story extraordinaire. Why? Because the writing is superb. It's erudite, concise and topical for today's reader in that Bouvier comprehends what makes the heart and soul tick of the people he meets. Especially relevant are the journeys through Serbia, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan moreover he describes them in an objective but kindly manner; he is a humanist with an aesthetic sensibility."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"It was the \`50's, and two authors hit the road. Since having read it, I think that Jack Kerouac's work, with the subject title is vastly overrated. He bounced back and forth between the oceans that encompass America, and seemed to see so little. But Nicolas Bouvier, seven years younger, was so much more perceptive, and undertook a bolder and more arduous journey, in a beat-up Fiat, with his artist companion Thierry Vernet.At 25 they simply did not have the financial resources to undertake the trip, so they \\"had to wing it,\\" and more than once benefited from the kindness of strangers. As an epigraph, he quotes Shakespeare: \\"I shall be gone and live, or stay and die.\\" And to those that have done it, the end of his preface rings true: \\"Traveling outgrows it motives. It soon proves sufficient in itself. You think you are making a trip, but soon it is making you - or unmaking you.\\"Bouvier was one of the trail-blazers along what would become known as the \\"hippie route to India\\" in the \`70's. He is Swiss French, from Geneva; he meets Thierry in Yugoslavia. They travel on through Greece, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and into Afghanistan, with the book, but not the journey (apparently) ending at the Khyber Pass, between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It takes them 18 months to complete this portion (they \\"wintered\\" in Tabriz, Iran). They both have an astonishingly well-developed aesthetic sense, and are quite knowledgeable in a broad range of fields, particularly for their age. And they are observant, both of their surroundings, and human nature. They have a \\"knack\\" for dealing with government officials, and the people of the road.Bouvier spins numerous memorable aphorisms: \\"It's very odd how revolutions which profess to know the people take so little account of their sensibilities, and fall back on slogans and symbols that are even more simple-minded than the ones they're replacing\\"; or, in terms of travel, \\"We denied ourselves every luxury except one, that of being slow.\\" Considering where we are now, always plugged in, and \\"on-line,\\" Bouvier makes an incredibly prescient observation for the \`50's: \\"They lack technology: we want to get out of the impasse into which too much technology has led us, our sensibilities saturated to the nth degree with Information and a Culture of distractions.\\"Consider his descriptive powers, and insight in the following observation: \\"Time passed in brewing tea, the odd remark, cigarettes, then dawn came up. The widening light caught the plumage of quails and partridges...and quickly I dropped this wonderful moment to the bottom of my memory, like a sheet-anchor that one day I could draw up again...In the end, the bedrock of existence is not made up of the family, or work, or what others say or think of you, but of moments like this when you are exalted by a transcendent power that is more serene than love. Life dispenses them parsimoniously; our feeble hearts could not stand more.\\"This is also a book that should be required reading for the American military general staff: \\"The Afghans don't change their ways for Westerners. There was no trace of the spinelessness some second-rate Indians greet you with, or the phony psychic powers some of them claim. Is it the effect of the mountains? No, it's rather that the Afghans have never been colonized.... Thus there is no affront to wash away, no complex to heal. A foreigner? Simply a man.\\"The best portions of the book were their time in Yugoslavia, \\"Kurdistan,\\" and at the Saki bar in Quetta. Perhaps it is the nature of travel, but I felt his anecdotes were too disjointed. There were numerous issues that were never explained, yet were central to the trip: Why winter in the bitter cold of Tabriz when it would have been much more enjoyable in Shiraz? Why end the book as he is to enter Pakistan, and there was apparently much more traveling ahead? How did they get back to Europe? Did he have his reunion with Thierry, and his new bride? His vignette of searching the Quetta \\"dump\\" for his lost manuscript is memorable; but it underscores the fact that all notes of his journey were lost there, and it was only 10 years later that the account was reconstructed in this form. Finally, though his observations about Islam seemed well-informed, he did get the Higerian century wrong - it was the 14th (p 98).Eighteen years after Bouvier I undertook a very similar journey, making it all the way to Madras, before flying on to Singapore (since deck passage on a boat across the Bay of Bengal was \\"not recommended to people of European origins\\"). I didn't have even a beat-up Fiat, and had to rely on local buses and trains, probably to my overall advantage. I wish I had this book to compliment my \\"Lonely Plant\\" guide, for a journey that almost certainly can not be made in peace for a person \\"of European origins\\" for another two decades. And for sure, I would have seen so much more if I had had Bouvier's erudition. For his age, a 5-star book, for sure; in the fullness of time though, I'll give it 4-stars."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"I love travel books and have read hundreds of them. This is the one that inhabits my dreams. The world it describes is lost forever---though it was only half a century ago, it seems as mythical as The Odyssey."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"In The Way of the World, Nicolas Bouvier recounts his youthful wanderjahr--actually a year and a half--with a painter pal, driving a finicky two-seater from his hometown of Geneva all the way to Afghanistan from 1953 to 1954. He's young then--in his mid-20s--but wrote the book later, self-publishing it first in 1963. It's a lovely book, full of youthful hope, sharply observed people from all walks of life, and colorful anecdotes. It's a world long since gone: Communist Yugoslavia before civil war rent it apart; Turkey still feeling its way in the world; Iran in the early days of the Shah, mere months after the overthrow of Mossadegh.Bouvier and Thierry Vernet, his traveling companion, search for work periodically to refresh their meager funds: freelance writing for Bouvier, art exhibitions for Vernet. It's interactions with the people they meet in these efforts that gives the book its special appeal--Bouvier has a knack for telling anecdotes that come alive in all their ordinariness.By late 1953, the pair have landed in Tabriz, in northwestern Iran, their little car unable to make it through the snow-covered passes that lead to Tehran and points farther east. They find a cheap apartment in Armenistan, the Christian Armenian quarter, and settle in, Bouvier teaching French to quietly desperate students. The delay in Tabriz is priceless for us: Bouvier paints a picture of daily life so real, and now so long gone, that it's aching in its poignancy. One tiny sample: he tells the story of a neighbor's daughter, an Armenian girl in love with a Muslim boy, and the impossibility of their lives. She kills herself along with her lover rather than be forced to live apart.With the spring thaw, the two travelers straggle into Tehran, then across eastern Iran to newly born Pakistan, and end up in Afghanistan, cast back in time before the modern world intruded.The Way of the World contains many passages worth slowing down to ponder. Take one moment, when they are just east of Erzurum in eastern Turkey (which I remember well, the bright blue September sky streaked with swirls of clouds, the tiled towers from the 1100s dazzlingly azure):\\"Time passed in brewing tea, the odd remark, cigarettes, then dawn came up. The widening light caught the plumage of quails and partridges ... and quickly I dropped this wonderful moment to the bottom of my memory like a sheet anchor that one day I could draw up again. You stretch, pace to and fro feeling weightless, and the word \`happiness' seems to thin and limited to describe what has happened.\\"In the end, the bedrock of existence is not made up of the family, or work, or what others say or think of you, but of moments like this, when you are exalted by a transcendent power that is more serene than love. Life dispenses them parsimoniously; our feeble hearts could not stand more.\\" (p. 94-95)And mostly what strikes me reading Bouvier is how much we lose in not seeing the past as part of the fabric of the present. In Iran, one student of Bouvier's laments the rise of fanatics in Islam. He tells Bouvier in early 1954:\\" \`Islam here? True Islam? It's absolutely finished--even more so now that fanaticism has reemerged with its hysteria and suffering. They come along behind their black banners, smashing up shops here and there, or they go into sacred trances on the anniversary of the Imans' deaths, and mutilate themselves.... Not much that's ethical there, and as for doctrine...! I knew some genuine Muslims here, really remarkable people, but they're all dead or have left. And now... Fanaticism, you see,' he continued, \`is the last revolt of the poor, the only one they can't be denied. It makes them noisy on Sundays but quiet the rest of the week--there are people here who see to that. A lot of things would be better if there were fewer empty stomachs.' \\" (p. 105)He's spot on, too, describing Americans he meets in Iran, their optimism, their navet&eacute;, their unconsciousness to the true sources of power, and the fact that American ideals simply are out of place in Iran; things just don't work that way there.The Way of the World could be compared, in a way, to Patrick Leigh Fermor's A Time of Gifts: travels by a young man, written up in retrospect, with more wisdom than someone of such youth might be expected to have earned. The world Bouvier describes is almost as much dead and buried as Leigh Fermor's pre-war Europe, too, yet is very alive in his telling. This is nourishing book is well worth reading--and re-reading."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"This is the tale of two twenty-something pals from France riding around Asia in a \\"rattletrap Fiat.\\" In fact, the Fiat is one of the star players. The thing is constantly breaking down or being defeated by the weather and topography. Bouvier, an aspiring writer, and his friend Thierry Vernet, an aspiring artist, are both accomplished mechanics. But they cannot always fix the thing and they do not always have the parts, which leads to lots of negotiations with the locals.This takes place in the 1950s (read: a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away), so the behavior of the locals might not be replicated today (read: don't try this at home). Still, you get a lot of little anecdotes from Serbia to Persia (Iran to you) to Afghanistan. One plus is Bouvier's writing ability. He can be quite poetic and fashion quite the sentence, and it holds together nicely through Robyn Marsack's translation from the French.If you're looking for a lot of coming-of-age material, like you often see in travel writing, Bouvier's not your guy. Although he does include some of his opinions and notes on his health, the focus is really on the land and the natives. He is, then, more objective than subjective, and the book does not wax philosophical so much. To its credit, the book does include bits of history. Bouvier wrote the account years later using his journal and obviously did his homework to leaven the bread. Fans of travel writing should embrace this book, though some fans in this niche demand more personal ruminations from the author than Bouvier will provide."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"The Way of the World captures the essence of Eastern Europe and Central Asia in the 1950s as well as the ramblings of our heros throughout their journey. The world that thety experienced and relate to us these many years later is a world that is lost to us. This was a world seeped in Cold War ethos as well as a world that was not as influenced by fundamentalist Islam. The writing is good, although there are passages which seem to go on forever, much like the plains and deserts that our heros crossed. If you enjoy travel books and books about far-away places, you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"Nicolas Bouvier is an enjoyable travel companion. He is observant, clever and writes well. His insights are excellent and he is absolutely fearless in relating ALL of the travel experience, whether good or bad. Bouvier's style is relaxed and very comfortable. One of his best aspects in relating his trip across the Middle East to India is his lack of judgmental cultural imperialism. Bouvier remains open to people, and because of this, he is welcomed and accepted. He comes in contact with a great cast of characters. It is most enlightening to look at the people and countryside through his 1953 eyes and see the area in an earlier time. I would highly recommend this book and author to anyone interested in the Middle East in specific and travel in general. Read it and take away some excellent lessons in how to be a good traveler and a welcome guest in another country."},{"Title":"The Way of the World","review":"This book is one of those books you will read and read again.

Not everyone wants, or needs, a top-end expensive complicated camera.Features.This soft cover book has 249 pages printed on high quality paper, with clear images and a CDROM containing Adobe PhotoDeluxe 4.1, a full program with no limitations which can be registered.PhotoDeluxe will enable image enhancement and manipulation and is a very good way to get the most from your snaps. It is a very simplified, but not a simple program, and is a major reason for getting the book.Along with this program come a variety of time-limited demos that you can use to see if they will make your photography experience better.Book Description.Digital Photography Essentials is a book which is aimed at the new user to a new way of photography. It contains a colour section covering all the black and white images scattered throughout the book.Chapter 1 is taken up with descriptions of how to go about taking the best shots getting the light right, and positioning either yourself or your subject.Chapter 2 delves into which camera you should get, and more importantly, why. It also explains how and why things work, such as batteries and how to care for them, memory management etc.Chapter 3 is the section on using the free Adobe PhotoDeluxe program supplied with the book, which you will use for all the exercises in the rest of the book.The program gives great image enhancement and manipulation abilities to the photographer, so if the image is not quite how you wanted it to look, you can change everything about it.This program is not complicated, but has many features of high-end photo retouching programs without having to learn industrial strength features that you may never use.You learn to do things like swapping faces or backgrounds, and, more importantly, how to use layers. This feature allows images to be altered without destroying the original image if your selection does not suit.Chapter 4 once again delves into the world of photo correction techniques. This is not as daunting as it may sound as PhotoDeluxe can fix things automatically. This leaves you free to dabble with settings once you know what each feature does. Sometimes automatic settings are not quite what you had in mind.Here you start using filters to add impact, or remove unwanted parts from an image. Learn to remove red-eye, which is often a feature of images taken with a flash.Chapter 5 teaches you to create panoramas, 3D images, and enlarge your images.From this point on the book introduces the demo and time-limited plugins and filters, which can be experimented with.Panoramas are used often, but what is not stressed is that panorama photos need to overlap by at least 25%, or more. This gives a much better chance of lining up features when joining the images. Use a tripod for getting good panorama shots. Tripods can be cheap but they do keep your photos level.Chapter 6 is all about printing, printers and paper, and presenting your images for someone else to print them for you.The resolution of an image is important when printing, or sending to the web. Both use opposite ends of the spectrum for their purposes, and you need to know which to use, luckily this is not complicated.Chapter 7 is about presenting your images on CD and DVD, and on interactive photo albums and slide shows. A lot of this chapter is about different commercial programs for the burning and display of your images.Chapter 8 is about sharing images over the web, and introduces the ideas of screen size etc, but resolution is also important as monitors only show at 72 dpi.Chapter 9 introduces a lot of different ideas for using your new digital camera remember photos cost nothing, so there is plenty of scope here.It is possible to use your digital camera to make a slide show presentation, document your belongings, or the contents of a box, or an accident. You can even photograph documents instead of using a scanner.Chapter 10 is dedicated to craft ideas that you can create with your camera. The list here is really extensive.Chapter 11 teaches how to transform images and create new and exciting things that you hadn't considered, check magazines and see how ads are manipulated for inspiration.Using PhotoDeluxe you can make slide shows and share them with friends. You can even make a colouring book from your photos using the filters in the program, make calendars, or animate images.Chapter 12 is spent introducing you to third-party programs so you can see what is available.Bottom Line.Not a book for an advanced photographer, as it is aimed at the beginner, which it does admirably, like a text book.The inclusion of Adobe PhotoDeluxe is a compelling reason for purchase, but the book opens up many exciting possibilities that you may not discover by yourself.The lessons are simple to follow, you don't have to learn new skills. Non computer-literate people can cope with the fun things that they will find to do. This book is like a text book on the use of PhotoDeluxe.Learn to correct faults in photographs and create something new. All you have to do, as the author stresses, is to take as many photos as you can. It will cost no more and you have more choices to play with later.Too much emphasis on commercial programs has reduced the rating, but the book is good, and the bundled software is great to start with. You may find you never need to get another program anyway.Tim Skyrme, 2003..."},{"Title":"Digital Photography Essentials: Point, Shoot, Enhance, Share","review":"DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY ESSENTIALSAUTHOR: Erica SadunPUBLISHER: SybexREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: The CD was the first thing I looked at.

Of course we all know the camera can be used for insurance purposes of accidents and the damage done but what about witnesses or even what was said if your camera has a sound-recording feature?What else is your camera good for? Need stickers or how about a jigsaw puzzle to keep a child busy? Remember \\"Shrinky Dinks\\"? This can be used to make charms for a bracelet from photos you have taken. What grandmother wouldn't want one of a monthly recording of their newest grandchild? This list can be endless - just use your imagination.Now that you have PhotoDeluxe installed on your computer, do you know how to use it? If not, check out Chapter 3 and 4.

So many of my daughter's books talked about a mother/child relationship, and I hadn't really found any books about a father/child relationship that I liked until I found this book. It talks about the very special things that a father might do for his child, such as teaching him to swim or fixing a broken toy. For example, one page shows a daddy taking his child to a parade. Then the reader lifts the flap to show that the daddy has given his child &quot;the best seat at the parade&quot; by placing him on his shoulders. My daughter likes this book, and so does my husband."},{"Title":"Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"This book would make a wonderful present from a 2 year old for Father's Day. Children from 2-6 should be very pleased with the book. The images and activities are fairly divided between daughters and sons, so it should be equally enjoyable for all young children. The large, pleasant water colors will be accessible for very young children. One year-olds will enjoy looking at the pictures. The book can also be used as a beginning reader around age 5. Lifting the flaps will seem like peek-a-boo for 2-3 year olds and will bring torrents of giggles.The book basically recounts lots of things that Daddies can help children with. My favorite was an illustration of a dozing Mom in a chair accompanied by the caption: &quot;Sometimes at the end of the day, Daddy puts you to bed.&quot;The book begins by having a girl try on Daddy's shoes and a boy put on Daddy's belt. Dealing with the relative size issue is a good place to start, and by making it humorous can take some of the potential discomfort out of the size differentials between children and the Daddies.When the flap is lifted, the child is included more directly with Daddy. For example, one illustration shows a Daddy shaving while a boy looks on. The caption is &quot;A daddy shaves.&quot; Under the flap, the boy has put some shaving cream on his own face, as well. The caption under the flap says &quot;And is good to smell.&quot;Daddies tickle your feet, mess your hair, try to fix things (not always successfully), help you deal with deep water (and teach you how to swim), protect you from big dogs, answer questions, go to work, and put you on their shoulders so you can see better.The book creates the expectation that Daddies will do things with their children, but not that Daddies are perfect. As you can see from the example, care is taken to turn Daddy's size into an advantage for the youngster.A benefit of having a book like this is to encourage Daddies and children to do more things together. Children are often very attached to their Mommies, and some are more than a little afraid of their Daddies. This book sets up an expectation of doing things with Daddies alone sometimes. That's good. Almost all children's books features Mommies doing things with children, so this book helps balance that mental image out.After you have been reading this book for awhile, I suggest that you ask your child what things Daddies could do that she or he would like that are not listed in the book. That can help you expand your relationship in mutually rewarding ways.Keep your eyes open for fireflies!"},{"Title":"Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"My 20 month old daughter loves this book. The flaps are large and easy to lift. The illustrations are cute. This book does a great job of showing that a lot of the everyday things Daddy's do are special. My daughter often asks to read this when her dad is working late, and she is thinking of him."},{"Title":"Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"Yes it is stereotypical, and not every page relates to my husband's role as a dad, but it is a fun book!

It is one of his favorites, and he brings it to us saying \\"Daddy, Daddy\\" when he wants to read it. The illustrations are cute & simple. The writing is sweet without being syrupy or too corny. It shows Daddy doing activities such as teaching you to swim, fixing your bike, and taking you to the parade. Reading this book with my son is a nice way to remember Daddy while he is at work during the day--it even mentions that \\"A Daddy goes to work, and hugs you when he comes home.\\" While this is not a board book, the pages are thicker than a regular book. I have found the pages & flaps to be very sturdy in the hands of my toddler. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"This book, along with 'Mommies are for Counting Stars', stereotypes gender roles so much that I probably won't even ready it to my son. Dads are shown as being active, fixing things and going to work, while moms mostly wait for their kids to come home and gestate babies while looking 'like a rose'. Not for families who are even a little progressive, or who have moms that work outside the home, or dads that stay at home."},{"Title":"Daddies Are for Catching Fireflies (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"This book is terrible.

Aryeh Kaplan's translation / commentary, and continuing through the original primary and secondary sources. Yet Ora Wiskind-Elper's work -- based on literary analysis coupled with more traditional understandings -- is the most profound and insightful treatment of the stories I have seen, aside from the works of R. Noson (Likkutei Halakhot) and R. Avraham b'Reb Nachman Chazan (Chokhmah U-Tevunah). Nothing in the academic world comes close. She seems to have an uncanny grasp of what the real issues are and what Reb Nachman not only says, but means to say. It is also refreshing to see that she writes with humility and respect about this towering and often misunderstood Hasidic mystic, and encounters the material on its own terms.

This way, fatigue and distance keep her from facing the truth and more importantly, her children whom she nearly gives away to her sister.Her sod-home neighbor and sister (by marriage), Karen, a widow, has accepted happiness in a new life and finally Ingeborg comes to terms and returns to the faith of her youth.The arrival of the distant cousin of her deceased husband, Haaken, eases the farm work but complicates the decision making. He is there ONLY to help the women with the farm for a crop season - or is he?The delinquent arrival of the young, spunky, opinionated youngest brother of Roald further turns Ingeborg's world upside down, emotionally.

I am so delighted and impressed to have discovered another author with the writing skill to make me feel that I am experiencing the settings being described,and Lauraine Snelling has that skill.I have to confess that while loving the first book,I did not much care for our heroine's sourpuss of a husband. I thought he was a wet blanket on every bit of joy she and her boys experienced,and was not one bit sorry when he disappeared in a blizzard.This second book has a news man come into their lives,who enjoys life and enriches their lives.

The color coding addresses a helpful concept, that of making manageable and navigatable a huge and many-themed book by scripture categorization for easier verse identification, memorization, or integration. However, there are a few problems that come with this approach:1. Some colors are confusingly close to other shades, such as the medium green indicating \\"Love\\" verses and the lighter green indicating \\"Commandments,\\" or the medium grey for \\"Sin\\" verses and the light grey for \\"History,\\"2. The categories are fixed, every single verse being allocated a color, so the readers are not personally able to classify verses according to how they mentally process them--for ex, a verse colored taupe for \\"Discipleship\\" to one reader might better be considered a \\"growth\\" verse that should be in the light green for \\"Commandments\\" category, but unlike highlighting a plain Bible, is stuck with this Bible's color choices, and3. The Bible's feature underlining the words of the Trinity presents problems for readers wanting to underline verses of their own choice; it would have been better for the Bible to use bolder lettering for these verses, thus leaving the underlining option open for readers.Another point to note, seeing as how the product is called a \\"Study Bible,\\" is that there are no doctrinal or applicational footnotes many come to expect from a study Bible. However, THE RAINBOW BIBLE does include other study features, such as center-column references, introductions and outlines for each of the Bible's 66 books, a 1-year Bible Reading Calendar, an 85-page concordance to look up verse locations for specific words, an 18-page subject guide to look up topics rather than specific words, and something I've not seen elsewhere: \\"365 Popular Bible Quotations for Memorization and Meditation,\\" which has verses from every Bible book.In sum, nice concept, visually attractive, helpful features, but it doesn't work for everyone. Alternatively, books exist that suggest Bible study and marking techniques (such as a rather complex system by Kay Arthur). For me I ended up taking ideas from here and there and coming up after much trial and error with my own system using a mix of underlining in different colors of ballpoint, circling promise verses' numbers in pencil, annotating margins with key letters or symbols in pencil, and using DRY markers that are neither a pencil or liquid marker (refillable Accent Dry Pencil Bible Highlighting Kit).THE RAINBOW BIBLE, which by the way is available in NIV or KJV, is especially good for devotional rather than academic reading, but with all the glowing reviews, I thought it might be helpful to share that it does present potential problems for some readers."},{"Title":"Rainbow Study Bible-NIV","review":"Over my 40 decades of life I have seen &amp; owned several Bibles.

Working internationally with corporations like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and U.S. West in project management, I have found that Gundling is clear about innovations across borders which 3M practices. This is very useful information for the global networks in business. The ideas about &quot;five innovative openings&quot; as a model for change goes well in the high tech dot.com world because the key to survival in the business world is innovation. How to innovate has always been the key question for international managers. Gundling has organized, for the practitioner, key questions to ask about innovation based upon his 10 year work with 3M. This is a good analytical tool for others to use. Hats off to 3M for allowing this kind of disclosure, analysis and critique."},{"Title":"The 3m Way to Innovation: Balancing People and Profit","review":"What would you do if you were one of five promoters who put down $ 5000 each to buy a piece of land, believing it to contain corundum (a mineral used to make abrasives) and discovered that it contained none?What would you do if you then decided to import Spanish garnet to make the abrasives and had the bad luck of its becoming soaked with olive oil during the voyage, resulting in abrasives of such poor quality that it took several years to restore consumer confidence?What would you do if the floor of your new factory building collapsed on the very first day under the weight of sacks of material stacked seven high for inventory purposes?Why, simple! If you are 3M Corporation, you would learn from adversity and go on to become arguably the world's most innovative corporation! With an arsenal of over 50,000 products.Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, the authors of \\"Build To Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies\\" say that if they were asked to bet their lives on the continued success of a single company over the next 50 to 100 years, they would bet on 3M.What are the ingredients of this unique corporate culture that makes 3M the most innovative company in the world and that which thus assures its durability?The book does a wonderful job in taking one through these ingredients and giving readers a feel of this unique corporation. It talks of how corporate values were first introduced by William McKnight, who was one of the first to stress on quality and innovation and employee satisfaction (3M was one of the first companies to implement company sponsored unemployment insurance during the Great Depression). Part of the principles he enunciated for human resource management (long before this was practiced elsewhere) included to foster a climate which would respect the dignity and worth of individuals, encourage initiative, challenge individual capabilities and provide equal opportunity.What are the ingredients of this unique corporate culture that makes 3M the most innovative company in the world and that which thus assures its durability?The book does a wonderful job in taking one through these ingredients and giving readers a feel of this unique corporation. It talks of how corporate values were first introduced by William McKnight, who was one of the first to stress on quality and innovation and employee satisfaction (3M was one of the first companies to implement company sponsored unemployment insurance during the Great Depression). Part of the principles he enunciated for human resource management (long before this was practiced elsewhere) included to foster a climate which would respect the dignity and worth of individuals, encourage initiative, challenge individual capabilities and provide equal opportunity.One of several management practices that fosters a culture of innovation is, for example, that of the 15 per cent Rule under which aspiring innovators with an idea rejected by management can continue to work on it invoking the rule. Another rule is The Benevolent Blind Eye, which asks 3M managers to be tolerant of such displays of independence.3M thus encourages \`inventorpreneurs' with a culture that does not come down hard on failure, resulting in its having today, a hundred years after being established, a company with one of the highest employee satisfaction levels. All this, with an eye on commercial success. 3M's definition of invention is \\" New idea + action or implementation which results in an iprovement, gain or profit'The book and indeed 3Ms culture, is full of anecdotal history. Like, for example how Al Boese, in the 1930s, whilst playing around with a machine that heated and kneaded rubber, used clumps of cellulose acetate fibres instead. What emerged from the machine, and from 3M, is nonwoven material. Initially, the only application for this was in decorative ribbons. But the interesting thing about 3M is how it uses technology effectively; it has 30 different technology platforms and one thing leads to another in amazing leaps of technology. The nonwover material was later used to make surgical masks, which has contributed significantly to medical and occupational health and safety businesses.3M encourages different employees working on different ideas to interact and exchange notes, what the authors call \`structured serendipity'. Art Fry, a 3M scientist, found that the markers of his hymnal were dropping off and wanted to develop one which would stick, but be peelable too. Structured serendipity was what caused Art Fry to recall hearing a co worker Spence Silver, talking about an adhesive he had invented but which failed to stick properly. And Post-It was born! Initially, Post-It met with resistance from the marketing department, compelling Fry to think like an inventopreneur and distribute them for use to their colleagues. Today Post It is one of the five most popular office products in the US.Will this unique organizational culture carry 3M forward? The authors feel that today 3M is at a crossroad. \`Perhaps at no time in the organization's modern history has the resilience and adaptability of its tradition of innovation been more severely tested. Top executives are being forced to weigh their own commitment to 3M's unique tradition and culture against the experience of Wall Street'A book worth reading for its insights into the most innovative company in the world; one which is regarded by several to be resilient enough to last out the next five to ten decades.Highly recommended by .......J Mulraj"},{"Title":"The 3m Way to Innovation: Balancing People and Profit","review":"It was very informative.

Grundling shows us how heavily relies on the innovative spirit and how nurturing it is part of the core value of the company. This also explains why it is difficult to transplant 3M's philosophy to other established companies, as it affects every aspect of the company. In order to use the 3M way it would have to be introduced right from the inception of a new company. On the other hand it is also obvious that one should not copy 3M directly today, as they may have difficulties adjusting to today's faster development pace. All in all an interesting book, which states a lot of good practices and also some not so good ones."},{"Title":"The 3m Way to Innovation: Balancing People and Profit","review":"I have been looking for a book with good practical insights on managing complex multinational operations. Gundling's study of 3M, it seems to me, gets it just right. Gundling has lots of practical examples from interviews with 3M personnel, apparently over a fairly long period of time, to go along with his formal analysis of how technical information is transferred among 3M subsidiaries. Chapter 5 on global innovation is especially good. As a professor, I had a particular reason to search out a book like this, but I would suspect that managers could adapt many of the best practices that Gundling identifies within 3M to their own companies."},{"Title":"The Promise: Contemporary English Version Hardcover","review":"It's sad that many of the good translations that come along go out of print so quickly. This is my only complaint about The Promise which is such a wonderful read. This version makes Scripture not only readable, but applicable to daily living. What The Promise also manages to do is illustrate all of God's promises in the text with extra \\"mini articles\\" that accompany the Bible text. The CEV text is also supplemented with all the alternate readings possibilities-these appear on the bottom of each page. Also-SINGLE COLUMN FORMATTING makes this text read like a letter-which it actually is-a love letter from God to His people. The KJV translators stated that translation was the key to opening the kernal that is God's Word. No doubt that they would support any translation that clarifies and simplifies the Holy Scriptures.

If you are a hobbyist who is somewhat Java-savvy and you are looking for a book that gives you rather non-complex code that performs complex tasks primarily by harnessing the power of native as well as open source Java API's, I would give this book four stars. If you are looking for some technical or computational details on some of the interesting topics that the author covers I would give it two stars since there is very little of that in this book. Therefore, considering all possible audiences, I give it 3 stars, or an average rating. This book is not a tutorial on the Java API's that it mentions, but it is the only book I know of that even talks about how to do anything with speech synthesis or voice recognition in Java using the free implementation of the Java Speech API, which is FreeTTS. I actually tried out some of the author's Java speech programs, and they do work as advertised. The author performs his interesting tasks by harnessing the Java Beans activation framework, the Java Communications API for serial port communication, FreeTTS and Sphinx API's for speech applications, the Java Advanced Imaging API and Java Media Framework for computer vision and camera control, and the servlet and JSP API for more complex control of a robot. He has even written his own package that pulls together all of these API's to perform integrated tasks, such as object recognition that integrates image processing, camera control, and speech recognition. Thus, I recommend this for a hobbyist who already knows Java and wants to use that language to control robots at a very high system-level. I do not recommend this book for people looking for theory or algorithms related to the topic of robot control. I notice that Amazon does not show the table of contents so I do that here:1.

Here you will find color pictures and additional description of the various robots described in the book. (There might also be an update or two to the software presented in the book).This is one of the few books around that combine both software (Java in this case) and hardware design. Building working robots require both, and here both are presented, although the real focus of the book is on the software. The hardware is specialty modules that are designed to handle various robotic functions common in modern robotics. These include fairly complex subjects such as speech and vision.The focus of the book, however is on the software. The hardware items basically are only converters that change sensed input into a stream of bits, or take a stream of bits and then convert them into motion, speech or whatever. Accepting this kind of input and outputting the appropriate control secquences is the subject of this book.

I thought this was a Java robotics book! But as I got into it, the robot is programmed in Java and talks to BASIC Stamp microcontrollers via serial interface. The microcontrollers handle critical peripherals. He does say that you could use another microcontroller instead of the BASIC Stamp, and suggests the Parallax Javelin Stamp which is programmed in Java as well. In fact, on his web site, he has the Javelin code to replace the PBASIC code in the book if you should decide to go that route and keep everything pure Java (which I recommend as I really like the Javelin Stamp).

The prose style is casual but very precise and always clear.I want to stress what an earlier reviewer pointed out: it is especially strong on real world backup and restore issues...which is MUCH more important and complex than is initially apparent.If you are tasked with building a real-world storage infrastructure: read this book first.

Some of the explanations reached as far back as NT3.5.The book also primarily focuses on Fibre-Channel and Network Attached Storage as these were the only available option in its space in 2002. Time has moved on, of course, but for the 2009 update a mere addendum with a few pages of coverage for iSCSI was included.Note carefully the dates of the reviews praising this title.

I read this book from cover to cover and the layout was great. The book starts with a good overview of the past technologies that most IT people know and then begins to compair them to NAS and SAN and shows how those old technologies are evolving to fit into the new design.As someone who has not had exposure to Fiber Channel hands on the book did a great job of explaining the technology and what part it plays. It gives a real nuts and bolts explination of the peices and what they all do.The book then goes into describing SAN. It gives some typical uses along with the advantages and even the disavantages of SAN. In the next chapter it describes one of the major advantages to SAN in terms of Backup and Recovery. It doesn't go into detail and tell you what the commands are to do these things but more what you need to get the job done and what role each part plays.The next three chapters are on NAS. The first one gives an overview of NAS and goes into uses along with the advantages and disadvantages of it. The second chapter gives information on how to manage NAS and is a bit too specific but does give a good foundation for the things that you need to look for to get the most out of NAS. The thirst chapter is on Backup and Recovery in a NAS environment. It gives a good overview of the technologies that exist but again gets into a little too much detail and is hung up on specific technologies.Overall I would suggest this book to any IT people who have a solid background in server and network technology but are looking for what storage solutions exist and how they can be leveraged."},{"Title":"Using SANs and NAS","review":"This book very well covers its objective of orienting one with SAN and NAS market and its major differences.

This expedition took several years. As their journey progressed so did the sufferings they endured. Several members of the group died of starvation and other causes. One was murdered and his killer was shot. It was incredible that anyone survived.Anyone interested in the Arctic exploration and early Native Americans will enjoy this book. The author, Sir John Franklin, was a fearless explorer who died on a subsequent Arctic mission. He descibes his meetings with the traders and local inhabitants in great detail. He relied in large part on local Native Americans as guides and hunters. It was his intention to meet with the Eskimo people, who avoided all contact with his group. The Native Americans refused to accompany the group all the way north due to their fear of the Eskimos. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The journey to the polar sea (Everyman's library)","review":"This is not a modern narrative designed to be enjoyed as an adventure book. Instead, it is an edited compilation of journal entries, including some accounts written by other members of the expedition. The only drawback for a modern reader is the faithful inclusion of detail which can seem irrelevant or repetitious. For each day of journeying, we read where they went, what they saw and experienced, what they ate, and how cold it was at night. I actually enjoyed this, taken in small doses, because it is so well written, but I can see how others might get tired of it. One advantage of this format is that it takes you into their world very effectively. You get a good sense of the landscape, weather, flora and fauna, as well as their clothing, tools and implements, and how they found food and fuel, traveled over rough and snowy country, arranged logistics, and organized their party.Of course, people also figure into this journal. Franklin was a British naval officer, and was closest to the other officers who accompanied him. Dr. Richardson, the surgeon and naturalist, appears to have been a particularly interesting character. The \\"men\\" are acknowledged, but not (for the most part) with the same degree of warmth shown for the officers. As another reviewer noted, Franklin did not seem to care too much for the Canadians. He did, however, have a lot of sympathy and appreciation for the local Indians, on whom his party relied for assistance with hunting and, in the end, for survival. The journal goes into a lot of detail about these Indians, including some anthropological observations by Dr. Richardson. I particularly enjoyed these accounts, which were fresh and respectful, and treat the Indians as interesting people with their own strengths and weaknesses.The final part of the book, describing the privations the party suffered on its return from the Polar Sea, is a page turner and a remarkable human drama, so even if you skim the middle parts of the book, be sure to read the conclusion. Franklin was obviously deeply touched by the kindness of the Indians who ultimately rescued the survivors in his party."},{"Title":"The journey to the polar sea (Everyman's library)","review":"In 1819, The Lords Commissioners of the British Admiralty appointed John Franklin, whose many experiences in the British Navy included Trafalgar, to lead an expedition in northern North America. Known as the Coppermine Expedition (1819-1822), its object was to explore the Northern Coastline from the mouth of the Coppermine River to its eastern terminus, wherever that might be found. A few trappers and traders had pioneered the headwaters of the Coppermine, but only the Inuit people, hostile to Europeans and other Native Americans, inhabited the Northern Coast. Franklin hoped to make contact with them, convince them of the white man's peaceful intentions, and gain useful information regarding the geography of the coast. The party included several other Englishmen, a few voyageurs, and a fluctuating number of Indian hunters and guides.This book is his narrative of that long and tragic journey, written in journal form by Franklin himself. Incredible struggles and hardships are related in a direct, matter-of-fact way (I was particularly struck by a casual reference to the expedition members eating old shoes, as if this were a normal part of their rations); injuries, canoe accidents, perfidious voyageurs and near starvation are described in detail as the adventurers slowly move farther north. The latter part of the narrative contains enough hair-raising occurrences to satisfy anyone's need for vicarious excitement.Journey to the Polar Sea is not light reading, but it's a treat for connoisseurs of the English language. Franklin's style, like that of many writers of his period, is stately and cadenced, with impeccable grammar and a knack for the striking phrase. The Kindle text is refreshingly free of typos and misspellings. Readers accustomed to the more expansive nature of Nineteenth Century non-fiction will find this work engaging and enjoyable, especially those who wish to learn more about the original inhabitants of these remote regions.Though the book may be interspersed with passages of strictly technical relevance, such as the results of Franklin's solar and lunar observations, \`Journey to the Polar Sea' deserves its place on the shelf with the great narratives of Polar exploration. Readers would do well to provide themselves with a map of the region, since none accompanies the text. A fine article on John Franklin in Wikipedia provides references for further reading."},{"Title":"The journey to the polar sea (Everyman's library)","review":"The last chapter, 50 pages long, is a real doozy! A real horror story of suffering and death.The style of this book is very stiff, formal and dry, due I suppose to the fact it was written by someone accustomed to writing official government requests and reports. There isn't much drama, incident or interesting detail in the chapters leading up to the final, climactic tragedy. It's very repetitive, just endless traveling through rivers and lakes.Franklin comes off as a real heal, as well. He drives his Canadian voyageurs to death and hardly has anything good to say about them. His cockamamie expedition causes the death of about half a dozen voyageurs but he only shows sympathy when his fellow officer, Hood, dies.Their exploration of the shores of the polar sea aren't particularly interesting, either. The chief impression is that he's traveling through a freakishly alien landscape.The presentation of the book is beautifully done so it's a real shame that that there are two or three typos on each page. On one page, eight words of a sentence are omitted rendering it gibberish (I had a PDF of an earlier edition to compare it with).You really have to be a diehard fan of exploration narratives to wade through all this. For the general reader I'd recommend just reading the final chapter and skipping the rest."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"The critics focus on Lawrence's lifelong sexual themes and his colonial-era views on race, but the best part of this book, and the reason it's still important, is that it contains Lawrence's prescription for modern metaphysical ills -- a return to religion, not Christianity but a sort of new paganism which draws at its core on ideas from gnosticism and eastern mysticism. Lawrence thinks that Quetzalcoatl would embody this new paganism in Mexico, but he has Ramon suggest to Kate that, if she returns to Ireland, she should encourage the Irish to similarly reinvent the Celtic gods on the gnostic model. Ramon thinks every culture should revert to its old gods -- which he thinks are all expressions of the same, universal God -- because different \\"races,\\" or to use more modern, politically correct terminology, different cultures understand the idea of \\"god\\" through their own unique experience, history and ways of thinking. Regardless of any other shortcomings, this is a fascinating, thoughtful approach, artfully presented.I liked Lawrence's Quetzalcoatl hymns quite a bit, and thought they added immensely to the above-identified theme. They reminded me a great deal of some the Nag Hammadi manuscripts -- gnostic Christian teachings discovered in Egypt in the 1940s, and famously described by Elaine Pagels in The Gnostic Gospels. What's most amazing is the depth and scope of Lawrence's gnostic philosophy without having had access to those ancient Egyptian texts, which were not discovered until after the writer's death.Those viewing this book through a purely feminist lens will dislike it; those who espouse identity politics will find themselves conflicted. But for anyone interested in a great writer's \\"practical\\" solution to the great spiritual dilemmas of the modern era, or who simply enjoys reading 400 pages of top-shelf prose, \\"The Plumed Serpent\\" is worth the time investment."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"One gets the impression that D.H. Lawrence's visit to Mexico in the 1920's was quite difficult; Mexico was rocked by political and social violence and even extremes of climate. Yet somehow, Lawrence has successfully managed to transform his experiences into a novel alive and vital. His characters are early 20th century spiritual seekers in a country that still has not been completely deadened by what Lawrence sees as the century's materialistic malaise. His spiritual ideas are much more profound than what can be found in most modern New Age manuals, and imbedded as they are in a realistic fiction, much more entertaining."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"This is one of those books that once you take the time to get familiar with, it will pull you along at a slow and sometimes painful pace. The honest and direct sensuality of the people, Kate's confusion between the love of life and the distaste for the common man, the marraige of religions, and the stuggle to become true men and women do offer the reader a wonderfly detailed story. I recommend this to anyone who feels they need a mental vacation for the social triviality of the modern day world. It is a book to help regain perspective."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers that this book has some wonderful writing. There are passages of description that simply dazzle. The scene in which heroine Kate first sees the gathering of the Men of Quetzalcoatl, where the beats of the drums seem to draw the soul from the earth, is absolutely mesmerizing.Yet for every memorable scene there are pages and pages of wild romanticizing about native values, obscenely outdated musings about race, and odd sentiments about marriage and women. Unlike &quot;Women in Love,&quot; this book doesn't present love in a very good light. Kate is seen as a woman torn between her need to be herself and her need to be subsumed by a man. And the answer is unclear at the end. I found her to be a sympathetic character despite her annoying quirks (if she hates Mexico so much, why doesn't she just leave?) and I felt the ending didn't show her growing or changing. I also felt that the other main characters (Ramon and Cipriano) became almost brutal by the book's end, and this development was not resolved in any satisfactory way.I have to admit being profoundly disappointed by the ending, and by the bizarre theorizing about the soul of the &quot;dark races.&quot; But, I had to keep remembering that this book was a product of the early twentieth century. And the writing is what still makes it masterful."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"In the area of the poetic use and the beauty of the English language, this book is well-written and certainly worthy of one's time taken in reading it. The language and the imagery invoked is breath-taking. In the area of subject matter, it is rather unique. An Irish woman journeys to Mexico just after the Mexican Revolution and becomes involved with two men who have taken it upon themselves to return Mexico to the religion of Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli. She joins them to become the First Woman of Malintzi and wife of the First Man of Huitzilopochtli. However, in the area of social language, the book is a product of its time. The Mexican people -- and all &quot;dark&quot; people -- are the objects of particularly malignant language, which I found objectionable. As an historian, I can place the book in its proper perspective, however, and recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Myths may not have any credibility or even feasibility, but the truth is that every new one accrues its followers. \\"Do it ... And then you will know,\\" from Cipriano's argument with Kate, could be seen as an attempt to convince the reader as well that myths are real and normal people believe in them, even the myth of Quetzalcoatl. This long-ago Aztec religion, revived for modern Mexico, ends up a contagious energy force that hits the country at the perfect time, spreading quickly and eroding the traditional Catholic foothold.Lawrence has gone to great lengths to make the details of Ramon's religion convincing and thorough. The creative language of Ramon's speeches and hymns comes across as realistic, and alluring enough to draw its early followers from the community. Ramon feels that his country is dead, or dying, and that it needs a religion that will bring rebirth or revival to his people. Ramon's wavering respect for the Catholic Church combines with his desire for a \\"living\\" Mexico and leads him to bring back Quetzalcoatl, an ancient Aztec god. His religion gains quick favor with the people because of its contiguity with the fundamentals of Catholicism. Ramon tells the people that God has called Jesus and the Virgin Mary back to heaven and has told Quetzalcoatl, his new identity, to restore peace to the Mexican people. His use of religious terms (the Cross, Paradise, Morning Star, Saviour, Will of God, etc.) helps verify his claim and earn him a place in the societal construct. This Biblical language referencing the resurrection of Christ, \\"... when I am new man? I will roll away the stone,\\" accomplishes the same effect as the Catholic terminology. This use of Biblical language culminates in Kate's response to Ramon's question \\"It is good, isn't it, Mistress?\\" with her answer \\"It is very good,\\" which uses the language of the Genesis Creation story.It is difficult to tell if Lawrence is using this novel as a praise or reprimanding of new myths. One can sense a satirical undercurrent of regret that humankind is so often ready to embrace new ideas like Ramon's. It is doubtful that Lawrence is speaking only about the country of Mexico. This uncertainty surfaces most often through the character of Kate as she wrestles with her English heritage and curiosity of Mexican culture. She wavers between giving herself over completely to Ramon's religion, and when she does finally give in, Lawrence leaves the reader with the feeling that she's made the wrong choice.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"D.H. is not at his best here, in &quot;white man's burden&quot; early 20th century Mexico. Kate, Irish girl stranded in central Mexico makes the best of things and develops theories about the &quot;dark races&quot; and their &quot;passions&quot; and why they can't seem to get their priorities in order. Masterful Aztec serpent carvings are described as having the appearance of &quot;coils of excrement&quot;. Young native girls stare out of their window like &quot;an animal in a cave&quot;, and go &quot;slap, slap, slap&quot; with their tortillas. Mexicans don't know how to keep themselves warm...they shiver like lizards on a bed of corn husks during the high-altitude nights. On occasion, though, they display creativity and masculine &quot;power&quot;. They dress in crisp whites and do dances and go through elaborate, New Age chants, including memorable quotes such as &quot;I am the stone of life&quot;, &quot;on to the nakedest star&quot;, before retiring to the pool of &quot;refreshing death&quot;. The nonsense ending where the &quot;Plumed Serpent&quot; enthusiasts usurp the Mexican government, instead of being riddled with bullets like every other insurgent Mexican reform group in the 20th century, strains the reader's patience and goodwill. Memorable on a number of levels, yes, but great literature, I don't think so."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Although one hesitates to give any book by D. H. Lawrence two stars, in this case I must. The Plumed Serpent is no Son's and Lovers. This late Lawrence book is filled with long-winded, pretentious and repetitive passages of ersatz Aztec religious claptrap and equally ill-conceived mysticism about the savage Mexican Indian as a race. Couple these with a sort of proto-fascism, and one has a pretty nasty book. Lawrence's take on gender relations in this world of neo-Aztec revival is equally unattractive. At the same time, there are the descriptive passages of great lyric beauty that are pure Lawrence and some earnest wrestling with questions of individualism versus the commonality of humankind. I didn't like the book, but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"I've read nearly all of Lawrence's novels; Plumed Serpent is rather different than the others. The language, syntax, and phrasing in PS is not so definitively the authorial voice of a cultured Englishman. In PS, the two male characters are charismatic Mexicans; the female surging between these two strong men is an Irish woman transplanted to early 20th Century Mexico. The language is very Americanized here, even though none of the characters are USA-Americans, while DHL makes much of Mexico being American -- as in \\"the American continent\\" -- and not European.DHL clearly was wary, perhaps even frightened, of Mexicans and what he repeatedly refers to, ominously, as their \\"black, center-less eyes.\\" For DHL this meant it was impossible to know what the Mexicans were thinking, or feeling, if they were (or weren't) in fact doing either. I doubt that this novel, were it new, would be published today: it would be pronounced racist and Feminists would deem it misogynistic, as the strong, independent female protagonist seems really just need to be sexually overpowered by dark, native men. (One might want to recall that a close American friend of DHL and Freda, the white female artist Mabel Dodge, who gave Freda a ranch near Taos, New Mexico, married a local New Mexican native American Indian--Red Indian, in the words of DHL.) When the book was originally published, the controversy was about it being Fascist. It is most certainly anti-Catholic. This being DHL, male skin is well in evidence, of course, in this case brown rather than pale white.There is a fair amount of Mexican native-Indian-gods-worshiping DHL poetry, if you like that sort of thing; if not, it is easy to skip over; it's man-cave kind of mumbo jumbo, though beautiful too. I presume (and intend to investigate) the scenes of native Mexican Indians stripping Catholic churches and burning the \\"idols\\" from within are fact-based. Another unusual thing: there is real shoot-'em-up (or slit their throats) violence here, though not much nor presented squeamishly.On the whole: something unexpected and unlikely from DHL...but quite readable too, a page-turner, as it were."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"I must say that I couldn't finish this book, because I found reading it so unpleasant. I generally love the classics and have a high tolerance for slow, plodding books, but I found this one painful.I understand that we should allow Lawrence a different standard for his portrayals of Mexico and \\"natives\\" since he was writing before our contemporary multicultural awareness. Nevertheless, I would expect insightfulness in his portrayal, whereas I found a simplistic racism. Had I finished the book, perhaps I would have found that he had more to say than what I have gleaned so far- that Mexico and Mexicans are evil, reptilian, and hopeless. That message was so repetitive that I had to give up on the book in order to save myself from the dark mood of the whole reading experience."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Kate, an Irish woman visiting Mexico, is in a continuous state of war with herself: whether to maintain her independence from men in the modern, European society to which she was familiar or to submerge her very soul to Cipriano, a Native American general bent upon revolution in Mexico. Cipriano would call it \\"uniting\\" their souls. Kate, having a gentle, womanly spirit, views Mexicans as \\"dark men\\" steeped in violence, revolution and death. She is sickened by this attitude--as she was by the bull fight presented early in the book--having lost a husband who was dedicated to fighting for Ireland's freedom from Britain. In fact, _The Plumed Serpent_ concerns the battle of women against men and the ambivalent feelings (including sexual) of one for the other. Kate is equally attracted to and repelled by the Mexican culture. Dona Carlota, the wife of Ramon who is a close friend of Cipriano, like Kate is an opponent of Ramon's revolutionary fervor. Both Ramon and Cipriano yearn to replace \\"the Gringo\\" Jesus Christ's hold on the Church with the Aztec God Quetzalcoatl. There is a harrowing and incendiary scene in the book concerning just this issue.The book contains a number of references to sexuality, both male (Cipriano and Ramon are often shown at least partially naked) and female (Kate's expression of her sexuality as an indication of her independence, whereas Cripriano often sees her as a vessel for his manhood). I only wish that Lawrence had not dwelt so much in the novel on hymns written by Ramon as a paeon to Quetzalcoatl. This often bogged the book down in pseudo-Aztec myth-making and took away from what was otherwise a well-written and meaningful book."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Lawrence was the first of the angry men who came to dominate English letters after WWII, only Lawrence was ahead of them by nearly fifty years. It is instructive if not enlightening to read Lawrence here in \\"The Plumed Serpent\\" and elsewhere, for example in \\"Kangaroo,\\" on the subject of the 'masses,' the people, and on democracy. Lawrence who was of working class stock created a reactionary persona who saw himself as an artistic aristocrat who looked down on nearly everyone. The opening scene at the bull ring is a masterpiece of writing. In it, Lawrence weaves his Irish heroine's visceral reaction to the cruelty of bull fighting into her observations of the Mexican people. Her conclusion, and I think Lawrence's, was that the bull's deserve our sympathy, while the people can rot. He was a great hater of the masses, as expressed in \\"Kangaroo,\\" his survey of the new emerging democracy down under. He was, as he said, afraid of the ant hill, the grinding down of human life to the multitude and its needs. In so many ways he was prophetic, anticipating many of the arguments and observations of the Frankfurt School members, such as Adorno, who came to America and were appalled. This is a great novel in the sense that it fully expresses Lawrence's view of the world. It displays his uniquely expressive prose and contains brilliantly observed details of the Mexican landscape."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Lawrence is much like Faulkner in the sense that his prose seems to spew out in gorgeous, confused, confussing, sometimes brilliant, sometimes horrid chunks. Lawrence's technique doesn't flow so much as it purges, and combined with the baroque possibilities of Mexico, it produces a massive and challenging novel that lunges from one extreme to another. I'm still not sure if Lawrence's conception of Kate Leslie was too complex for me to grasp or simply convoluted. The novel begins abruptly and ends in even greater uncertainty... But in between, it is a great book to keep on your nightstand for a month or two."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"At times lyrically intoxicating, yet mostly just a flawed, rambling novel that gets painfully tedious towards the end, this is definitely one book by Lawrence that you can safely skip. It unfortunately isn't just bad writing - it's also a poor reflection of Mexican society. It makes you wonder how much time Lawrence actually spent in Mexico before he wrote the book. His depiction is stereotypical throughout, and often borders on racism. He seems to have skimmed the surface of Mexican culture, but he hasn't gone much deeper than that."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"Mandatory reading for anyone who regards himself as 'politically correct'. Outside of this context, the book doesn't carry much force. Endless observations on Mexico that don't seem too distant from Lawrence's own views; just tweaked enough to fit into his main character's head. A well written first chapter - at the bullfight - disintegrates as we step outside the lives of the characters who show the potential for greater developement and move into a fanatasy realm embodied by one lady's midlife crisis and whether she can reconcile anything that makes up her past. Largely, the book is very linear and won't require much reflection on past pages from the reader as things plummet towards orgiastic."},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"One of the most boring books you'd ever read. The language is as rich as it'll ever get, but it used to narrte the muse of someone tethering on the verge of insanity. I've battled through 150 odd pages of the book and can't understand the premise. The ruthless (upto 5 times on every page) use of the word \\"naked\\" & \\"ruddy\\" gets irritating. I fail to understand as to why would the author think that people from Mexico are evil and are pulling the earth beings down. A dark & useless book. Stay away!!!"},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","review":"I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico. If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life, pick up a book by a respected latin author, not this joker.

I only found it because of amazon's amazing \\"recommended for you\\" feature. It put together the fact that I enjoy memoirs, baseball, and Italy, and found a book about all three.Baseballissimo is by Dave Bidini, a Canadian author. A surprisingly high percentage of the offbeat and intriguing books that I come across are by Canadian authors. I don't know how it works exactly, or what the income tax rate must be in Canada to subsidize such a program, but apparently the government actually pays authors to write books. They paid Bidini to take his family (wife, toddler, and infant) to Nettuno, Italy for six months so he could follow the local baseball team, the Peones for a season, and write a book about it. He says his choice was between baseball in Italy or wrestling in Newfoundland. Doesn't sound like a tough choice to me.Bidini sits in the dugout and sometimes warms up with the Peones, an amateur team in one of the several Italian leagues. He gets to know the players and gives them all nicknames. He finds out how baseball came to be so popular in Italy (American GIs introduced it during World War II). He and his family become temporary residents of the small town of Nettuno near Anzio and about an hour's drive south of Rome. Bidini gets in touch with his roots - his grandparents were immigrants to Canada from Italy. He reminisces about how baseball has always been a part of his life. And he follows the Peones from pre-season training to the exciting season finish against Palermo.Sometimes you get the feeling that Bidini cares more about the game than the Peones do. They're a good team, but it's just amateur baseball, and they all have day jobs and girlfriends and lives. Bidini's pushing forty and the manager, although still fit and athletic, is in his sixties. The players, mostly in their twenties and in a country where soccer is king, are sometimes late for practice, or are more interested in the fantastic pre-game snacks they've brought. Since this is Italy, there are no hot dogs and sunflower seeds. It's homemade pizza, smooth espresso, and sugary pastries. Sure, the players want to win, and they go all out when they play. But to them it's just a game. Little do they know."},{"Title":"Baseballissimo, My Summer in the Italian Minor Leagues","review":"Baseball has been a popular sport in Italy ever since it was first introduced by American soldiers who liberated Italy from the fascist in World War II. Author Dave Didini (along with his wife and two small children) traveled to Nettuno, Italy (south of Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast) to seek out his favorite summer game in what has evolved into the \\"baseball capital\\" of Italy since 1944. The serie A team in Nettuno is the Indians -- but this is a team stuffed with talent imported from Latin America. So for six months Didini followed the fortunes of the Serie B Peones, solidly staffed with Nettunese locals. When he returned to America, he sat down and wrote up his experiences with Italian baseball and culture. The result is Baseballissimo: My Summer In The Italian Minor Leagues. A lively and informative account that is a \\"must read\\" for anyone with an interest in baseball, as well as the armchair traveler seeking a quite different perspective on living and life in contemporary Italy."},{"Title":"Baseballissimo, My Summer in the Italian Minor Leagues","review":"For anyone who loves baseball, food, wine, Italy, and music (not necessarily in that order), this is the book for you. Dave Bidini's experiences with the Peones are hilarious. Imagine the passion that Italians have about everything in life. Now imagine that passion when arguing with an umpire. Hot dogs in the dugout? Not in Italy. Italians know how to eat!

Not that Neruda isn't a great poet, the Nobel Prize and critical acclaim prove the contrary, but perhaps the translation could use some more work.I picked this copy up noticing the name of Robert Hass', the translator and author of the Essential Haiku, on which he did a great job. Unfortunately, Eisner is the editor of the majority of the poems. The analogy to Eisner's translation would be like what Zondervan did to the bible in their NIV. It's not a bad translation, but it's moderned up a bit. I would have appreciated a more King James-like translation of Neruda's poems as I could infer a lot of missed nuances that appear to be in the original Spanish on the opposite page. A lot of the translations lack the depth and texture of what a great poet should have, and sometimes it feels like I'm reading a different poet altogether.For instance, a line \\"Hermano, hermano!\\" is translated as \\"Hermano, hermano!\\" in the English, though it could have plainly been have translated as \\"Brother, brother!\\" considering the second \\"hermano\\" is not capitalized. Perhaps this was Neruda's original intent, but there is no way to tell as there are no footnotes.Poetry is about texture, a poet's voice, and brilliance in how the artist uses his words to paint; this translation doesn't do enough to convey the voice of Neruda, but merely makes it accessible to new readers of not only Neruda, but also poetry."},{"Title":"The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems (Bilingual Edition) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"This beautiful collection of poetry contains both English & Spanish versions of Neruda's poetry.

His love poems, the greatest of which I do not believe are included in this volume are so filled with the wild viccisitudes of passion that they are among the greatest in any language. Here a host of devoted and competent translators take a rich variety of his poems and make them move in English with what I suspect is something of their original Spanish rhythm. The text of the original is even for those who do not know the language well a necessary accompaniment to the translation. Even if one reads the original without understanding it one can catch something of the voice of the Neruda for whom Poetry was as vital and universal as bread."},{"Title":"The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems (Bilingual Edition) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I gave this product as a gift...the person that received it enjoyed it very much..a unique publishing of Neruda's works."},{"Title":"The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems (Bilingual Edition) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I highly recommend this edition!

The concentration is on that part of the campaign aimed at Moscow, and the activities of other forces, detached to address different targets, are only covered in so far as they impact on the march on, stay-in and retreat from Moscow. A huge number of personal recollections have been carefully sifted and appropriate extracts selected, and then merged into a continuous narrative, linked almost seamlessly together by Mr.Britten-Austin himself. The result is a masterpiece. The feeling of immediacy is very pronounced and indeed at times the events, harrowing in themselves, are so graphically described by the participants that the reader has to pause, all but overcome by the horror and pathos of the narrative. This volume is dominated by the conflagration that engulfed most of Moscow immediately after the French arrival, by Napoleon's dithering as he waits for Russian responses that never come to his peace overtures, by Murat's starving forces confronting increasing Russian resistance and by the fatal decision to lurch southwards from Moscow with forces that have already been depleted by hunger and disease, and demoralised by looting and growing breakdowns in discipline. The volume ends with the Emperor's realisation, far too late, that a victory in the field, in the Ukraine or elsewhere, is impossible in 1812 and that retreat is unavoidable. This is grim story of wishful thinking, lack of realism and of a slide towards disaster. Few of the major players come well out of it, other than Prince Eugene Beauharnais, Napoleon's stepson, who in this and the subsequent volume, emerges as an admirable and capable commander in very difficult circumstances. As with the other volumes the footnotes (at the back of the book) are a joy, often packed with detailed information that sheds significant illumination on the main text."},{"Title":"Handbook of Technical Writing","review":"This book was boring, filled with too much English 101 inside this book instead of how to break it into the technical writing fields. I could have used a old college English instead"},{"Title":"Handbook of Technical Writing","review":"This is a useful reference to have on the shelf of the university's library."},{"Title":"Handbook of Technical Writing","review":"As a technical writer, I've found this book to be just that. While it definitely is not a \\"how to write technical manuals\\" type of book, the topics and material covered make it well worth having on any writer's bookshelf. And in this latest edition, not only have the editors done another great job, the book's page layout is wonderful. In previous editions, all text and type was in black. In this edition, headings, paragraph titles and diagrams are framed in blue. This seemingly minor change makes the book's material easier to read and refer to.The book continues to have extensive information about writing-related topics. Everything from proper grammar, to writing reports, to interviewing subject matter experts, how to do Internet research for a writing project, writing newsletters and/or abstracts, interviewing for a job and interviewing a subject matter expert for more information about a subject, writing proposals, and so forth is covered in this book. There's even a companion web site to the book that provides links to online resources for further information.The book's preface contains what the editors consider their \\"Five Steps to Successful Writing,\\" and also a \\"Checklist of the Writing Process,\\" complete with subsections containing listings for (in order) Preparation, Research, Organization, Writing a Draft, and Revision. In fact, a few of the book's numerous entries contain their own \\"writer's checklist\\" of things to do. Some subjects have not only a heading, but cross-references to other pages of related topics. For example, if I was interested in learning how to write a proposal, I could go to that listing, and also find reference information on internal and external proposals. There seems to be at times an endless wealth of information about whatever writing topic you are looking for. This book's main strength obviously is how all the book's material is organized.This is one book every writer should have. Even though it isn't a \\"how-to-write\\" book, it's still a \\"tools for writing\\" book. I find myself referring to it often when I'mworking on any kind of writing project.As with past editions, the book's editors have done a wonderful job with this handbook."},{"Title":"Handbook of Technical Writing","review":"Summary: If you already have an adequate writer's handbook, look elsewhere for advice about technical writing. If you are new both to writing in general and technical writing in particular, you could do worse.The publisher claims that the handbook &quot;is specifically geared to the art of technical communication&quot;. Not so. The majority of information here pertains to all writers--for instance, the explanation of the proper use of italics and discussion of the voice, mood, and tense of verbs. Even the examples are general rather than technically-related: the entry for like/as has the example &quot;She took to architecture as a bird takes to nest building&quot;, which it is difficult to imagine finding in a computer manual, progress report, proposal, or even correspondence.Some readers may find value in the longer entries, such as those about feasibility reports, instructions, process explanation, proposals, and various types of letters. These provide an interesting combination of introduction/recap for these topics. However, some of the longer entries are bewildering--for example, there is an entry about interviewing for a job, the presence of which is difficult to justify, particularly as the discussion is not specific to jobs in technical writing.Several entries are marked with a symbol that resembles a cross between the European recycling logo and the yin/yang symbol. There is no explanation of the meaning of this symbol... unless the reader happens across the entry for English as a second language (ESL). Ouch.Although this fifth hardcover edition has a 1997 copyright date, some examples betray the book's earlier origin. The examples of typeface quality (under the entry for word processing) shows a very early laser printer. The text discusses dot matrix, letter-quality, and laser printers-inkjet printers are not mentioned. Similarly, there is no discussion of the writing of software documentation. I was left with the feeling that revision was limited to insertion of new entries (such as the Internet item).This book is an uneasy compromise between a grammar style guide and a series of short articles on technical writing. I yield to educators to judge whether or not it is suitable for first-year university and college students. My subjective impression is that it does not represent value for money, even for that audience."},{"Title":"Handbook of Technical Writing","review":"I have the 5th edition of this handbook. It is a very good reference book to keep at your desk.

The authors are careful to keep the volume up to date -- for example, their discussions of computer documentation have evolved in parallel with computers themselves. There are loads of helpful examples and illustrations (the graphics examples are generally outstanding), and discussions of everything from frequently confused words (e.g., affect vs. effect) to how to write a proposal.

I forgot the number of times I've consulted this small-sized but dense (and heavy) 646-page reference book.Organized alphabetically, the \\"Handbook\\" addresses almost every topic and concept one can think of in technical communications, and then some...Not only the material is presented in chapters devoted to one letter of the alphabet (A to Z), but there are also three different Indexes which make navigation through this dictionary a breeze.There is of course the regular alphabetical Index at the end of the book. But in the front, there are also a \\"Checklist of the Writing Process\\" and the \\"Topical Key to the Alphabetical Entries\\" which are both very useful.One distinguishing characteristic of this great handbook, in addition to the explanation of individual concepts, is the concern for the training of the users. This is not a simple dictionary just aiming to \\"explain\\" things and leave it at that. The authors Alred, Burslaw and Oliu also genuinely want to help the readers become better and successful technical writers in every possible way.Sidebars and special topics, for example, are a reflection of that broader concern.Examples: the comprehensive entry on Resumes, Pronouns, English as a Second Language, many Checklists on a variety of topics, Instructions (on procedural writing), components of a document, graphics and illustrations, etc.I also love the special WEB LINK inserts which refer the reader to selected online sources.Here are some of my most favorite Checklists provided by the Handbook:* Observing Workplace Netiquette* Newsletter Articles* Revising Your Draft* Using Headings* Creating and Using Drawings* Creating Sales or Informational Brochures... and dozens more!This is one of the books that (yes) I sometimes take with me when I go out on vacation in case I need to check something, or just to crack it open to a random page and read it for my own personal pleasure.

Georgia Blue, former government agent turned killer provides a special tension for Durant in this novel, and con man Maurice &quot;Otherguy&quot; Overby (It wasn't me - it must have been some otherguy who looked like me) brings his own just outside the law talents to bear.The plot seems a little extreme, even for Thomas whose plots can twist like you wouldn't believe, but he always seems to exaggerate a bit when he is dealing with either California and/or the entertainment industry. Still, the book moves at such a pace and the dialogue and one-liners come so thick and fast that one doesn't have time to fret about how likely some of the convolutions are. This is high speed, fun, great reading."},{"Title":"Voodoo Ltd","review":"The book's title, Voodoo, Ltd., derives from a mispronounciation of Wudu, Ltd., a London based detective agency run by two Americans, Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.Early in the course of this smartly written dark comedy, a wealthy German businessman with the improbable name of Enno Glimm hires Wu and Durant to locate a pair of British hypnotists who have suddenly gone missing in Southern California. Glimm suspects that the hypnotists are about to blackmail Ione Gamble, a Hollywood actress-director, who has been charged with murdering her ex-fiance. Which is to say that Voodoo, Ltd. is the granddaddy of all shaggy dog stories. And what an entertaining one it is!Before descending onto the Los Angeles scene, Wu and Durant hire three former colleagues to assist them. They are; Booth Stallings a 65 year old counterterrorism expert, Georgia Blue, a statuesque former Secret Service agent who has spent the last five years in a Manila prison, and Maurice Otherguy Overby, an adventurer with dubious ethical standards. Together, these five very colorful and supremely resourceful characters use every trick in the book to solve the mystery while at the same time making sure that one or more of them doesn't double cross the others.This is a deliciously witty, irreverent novel. Believable? Not for a minute. It's not meant to be.It is meant to be a hilariously funny, over the top, comedic novel. And by that standard, it is an overwhelming success. Read Voodoo, Ltd., you'll love it."},{"Title":"Voodoo Ltd","review":"This is the second book in a series with the same cast of leading characters. Artie Wu and Quincy Durant are still teamed up as a pair of detectives. Booth Stallings has joined Otherguy Overby to form Overby, Stallings Associates, a consulting firm.

They, in turn, hire Overby, Stallings and Georgia Blue. All are survivors from OUT ON THE RIM. Five years have passed and Georgia has just been released from a Manila prison. The others have made a bundle of money and then lost it in the interim. Now they are hungry for work again. This book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Voodoo Ltd","review":"The New York Times Book review has described Ross Thomas - as the master of the crime thriller.They are exactly correct, nobody writes plots with the characters and humour of Mr.Thomas.In this book we have Arty Wu and Quincy Durant ( WuDu Ltd) as Private Investigators who solve -big problems for big bucks - something they are a bit short of at the moment, bucks that is not problems.They are hired to find two missing hypnotists who are needed to prove the innocence of a movie star charged with killing her ex-fiancee. All run of the mill stuff until things get a bit more complicated.To complete the job they enlist several of their associates; - who happen to be terrorism experts, con men and con-women. None of these people have any scruples or morals , basically they are all crooks and this makes for a rollicking story set in southern California.Like all of his books this rocks along with double crosses, triple crosses and other numerous twists which keep you busy to the end.This is an absolute joy to read.Also recommended are - The Eighth Dwarf and Twilight at Mac's Place.Just as good as the novels written under the name Ross Thomas are several under the Pseudonym Oliver Bleeck.Thomas's books are difficult to get in New Zealand, so any that you find are gems and to be looked after or they are all available through Amazon.

Ross Thomas is a master of the English language, the books are paced terrifically well, and the characters interesting, multi-layered and inviting. One of the interesting things about Thomas and his characters it that you just never know what they are going to say next. I am about 80% of the way through Voodoo Ltd., and have no idea how it is going to end. To me, \\"Chinaman's Chance\\" is the best of this series featuring Wu and Durant, probably because it was first. \\"Voodoo Ltd.,\\" is better than the second book, \\"Out on the Rim,\\" however, I do recommend reading them in order if you have the opportunity.

They earlier books featuring Artie Wu and his partner Durant. It is not necessary to read them in order of publication, but it helps a little, and to be truthful I enjoyed the earlier books more.St. Martins Press is to be congratulated for reprinting many of his books. He had gone out of print for awhile, but the more I read his books the more I wonder why. He is a great stylist with a edge of dark humor.

(This is a review for the Unabridged version of &quot;Wyoming&quot;).The first wagon train to cross the American continent and forge the Oregon Train reached the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the autumn of 1938. Over 500 weary pioneers considered themselves lucky if they traveled more than 10 miles per day. They found a safe valley in the Wyoming country where they could spend their second winter together before attempting the last leg of their journey to Oregon Territory. They had survived Indian attacks, floods, sabotage, illness and accidents and now had to build temporary housing and forage, prepare and store food for the bitter cold months ahead. If all went well, they would reach their new home by late summer 1839.This group of farmers, artisans, professional men, merchants, adventure seekers, and their women and children were led by skilled veteran mountainman Whip Holt, and his blood brother, Cherokee warrior Stalking Horse. They were joined in Independence, Missouri by Lieutenant Colonel Lee Blake, the US Army's leading counterintelligence expert. He had been sent by President Martin Van Buren to help protect the wagon train from the British and Russian saboteurs who were determined to destroy it. Both Russia and Great Britain were vying with the US for possession of the Oregon Territory and all its riches.The group had long since accustomed itself to communal living and almost everyone worked easily together for the benefit of all. They had also been joined by La-Ena, a beautiful Indian woman, half-sister of Stalking Horse who Holt had spent several winters with before leading the wagon train. Dolores, a half Mexican, half Indian woman and seer joined them as did Ginny Dobbs, a woman who had been badly hurt by life. Their stories, mingled with those of characters from the earlier books, greatly enrich the novel. An epidemic of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever struck and many died from this dreaded disease, so some characters are lost also.The author vividly brings history to life in &quot;Wyoming,&quot; as in the other books in the series. And the politics behind the settling of the West are fascinating. As one would expect, the novel is chock-full of adventure, hardship, courage, love, loss, tragedy and triumph. Many details have been taken from actual diaries and journals of early pioneers. Once you start this book you won't be able to stop until you have read all 24 novels. The next one is &quot;Oregon,&quot; and deals with the last leg of the trip - reaching Oregon, building new lives and the confrontation between three great powers - the United States, Imperial Russia and Great Britain.

This text, derived from a series of lectures given in the 1910s, has held up over time (its initial publication was in 1921, and has been reissued periodically ever since) as a touchstone of historical and theoretical explorations of what common law is and how it operates, both in the British and American contexts.Unlike constitutional law and other kinds of codified law from legislative bodies, the common law is more of a development from the masses, at least insofar as it connects with the judicial aspects of government which in turn recognises certain things as legal or illegal. Indeed, Pound sees the triumph of the idea of the supremacy of law over authority to be a victory of the spirit of the common law (specifically, he refers to the supremacy of the law over the Stuart monarchs in Britain, but also that common law practice has survived Renaissance, Reformation and the institution of Roman law).Pound looks at the common law in different phases - feudal underpinnings, Puritan influences, relationship between judiciary and the Crown/executive authority, philosophers such as Locke, and growing judicial practice in the trans-Atlantic context during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Pound does have a distaste of law for law's sake, and warns against attitudes that are 'a natural result of measuring the law solely by standards drawn from the law itself.' He is strongly concerned with the idea that the law be accessible to all, regardless of background, education, or ability to pay - there should not be one law for the rich and another for the poor.Law is for the betterment of society, and the spirit of the common law has this at heart, according to Pound. This text of Pound's, an enduring favourite, is a good exposition of how and why the law is important for a well-regulated society, and how the spirit of the common law needs to be cherished, preserved and strengthened by the legal profession for the sake of whole community."},{"Title":"The Spirit of the Common Law (Beacon Paperback)","review":"This is not a criticism of Roscoe Pound's work but of the commercial packaging by Nabu Press. It is hard to say what is more offensive: Nabu Press' assertion that books from before 1928 necessarily contain typographical flaws (when the poor appearance of the text has a lot more to do with Nabu's reproduction techniques than the original printing), or its attempt to profit from work for which the copyright has expired and that rightfully belongs to the public.

Conrad Stein begins by explaining the economic and social troubles that troubled Mexico at the turn of the century as Zapata was growing up. Things came to a head when Porfiro Diaz, an ex-army general, served as president of Mexico and ruled as an iron-fisted dictator, while for Zapata it was the decision to resort to violence when legal means proved futile.Stein devotes chapters in this book to the start of the Revolution and the extent to which the war ravaged the entire country. Along the way Zapata's important role in the revolution is detailed and young readers will get a sense that if there was any one who had the right reasons for fighting in the war it was Zapata. However, the fate of Zapata and his Zapatistas is not what it should have been, and those young readers will be surprised and probably troubled by the bloody history of the Mexican Revolution in contrast to what they know about the American Revolution.One thing I like about Stein's book is that he is works into the text such things as a quotation from a novel written during the revolution that provides an apt metaphor for the national turmoil and ends the book on a poetic note. Stein, a historian, has published more than 150 juvenile books, many of them on history, so I am well familiar with his work and this is one of his best books. He deals with a complicated situation in Mexico during this period, providing informative sidebars on Mexican history, tank tactics, the Mexican National Anthem, the Races of Mexico, and the Modern-day Zapatistas. He also uses sub-titles in chapters to highlight key parts such as the Plan of Ayala.The book is illustrated with historic prints, photographs, and paintings (the cover is a detail from &quot;Emiliano Zapta&quot; by Diego Rivera). The first eight volumes in this series, &quot;A Proud Heritage: The Hispanic Library,&quot; were published last year and &quot;Emiliano Zapata: Revolutionary and Champion of Poor Farmers&quot; is one this year's eight new volumes. The others are devoted to &quot;Christopher Columbus: Opening the Americas to European Exploration,&quot; &quot;Frida Kahlo: An Artist Celebrates Life,&quot; &quot;Hernando Cort&eacute;s: Conquistador and Empire Builder,&quot; &quot;Mario Molina: Chemist and Nobel Prize Winner,&quot; and &quot;Pancho Villa: Mexican Revolutionary Hero,&quot; as well as volumes on &quot;The Conquistadores: Building a Spanish Empire in the Americas&quot; and &quot;The Changing Face of America: Hispanic Roots, Hispanic Pride&quot; (the first set had a volume on Coronado). Given that Hispanics are now the second largest ethnic group in the country the value of a series like this is better than ev"},{"Title":"Fox Island Stories","review":"Ms. Roebuck's first book is an work of shimmering descriptions and ruminative reflections. Her attention to detail, paticularly her own musings (&quot;I wondered abt things all day, every day. . .&quot;), leads the reader through her several journeys between Alaska and New Mexico. &quot;Made discontent by the onus of planning for life's stages,&quot; Ms. Roebuck creates for herself a pack-up-and-go sensibility that few women, especially, have allowed themselves to realize. While it is easy to be swept away by the events and the landscapes of FOX ISLAND STORIES, the reader is equally likely to be bolstered by Ms. Roebuck's unique search for wisdom. This is the story of one woman's gentle stalwartness, substantial bravura, and almost unwittinginvincibility.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was made near the end of 1987, so it only has pictures and information on Madonna from 1982-87. In the back portion of the book it does however have a short year by year biography on her. The pictures are black and white or colored. Many of them are from her different concerts. The book also includes some information on the earlier movies Madonna starred in such as Who's That Girl? and Shanghi Surprise. There are alot better books on Madonna that you could get, but for the price this is a great book. The pictures are beautiful and it is a welcome addition to my Madonna collection."},{"Title":"Madonna Superstar: Photographs (Schirmer's Visual Library)","review":"The photographs in this book capture the \\"glamour\\" Madonna perfectly. The pictures have a very crisp feel to them, at times verging on remote; Madonna's glamour shots, though largely reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe in this book, do not have the same \\"inviting\\" allure that Marilyn had. I suppose this is because it is unmistakable that Madonna is a powerful woman who must always be \\"in charge\\" and is in complete control of her career and her image, whereas Marilyn Monroe projected an air of vulnerability for which Madonna is probably without the capacity. But Madonna is still a beautiful and at times \\"exotic\\" creature.Several pictures in this book had previously been published in magazines, the cover shot, for example, was once the cover for Life magazine. Many pictures from that same photo shoot are reproduced here, with the most touching being the \\"group hug\\" between Madonna and about seven siblings. A few out-takes from the \\"Like a Virgin\\" album cover photo shoot are included in this book as well.The era of Madonna's career that is covered in this book is somewhat small, considering that she has now been in the public eye for nearly 20 years.

Differential topology has found a niche in economics, physics, financial engineering, computer graphics, and computational biology, and it will no doubt find many more in years to come. It is also an area of mathematics that is still advancing, and there are many unsolved problems that can lead to interesting research programs. The author reviews elementary topology in the first chapter and then immediately introduces differentiable manifolds in the next. The presentation is very clear, and the author does not hesitate to use pictures to motivate and illustrate the main points. All of the discussion in these two chapters can be read easily by someone with a background in undergraduate calculus and some linear algebra. Special subsets of differentiable manifolds, the submanifolds, are considered in chapter 3, with the important embedding theorem proved. The theory of critical points follows in the next chapter. Although Morse theory is not mentioned, the author does define nondegenerate critical points, and shows, via a collection of exercises, the well-known result that a differentiable function in a neighborhood of such a point can be written as a quadratic form. A stronger embedding theorem is proven, namely one that allows an embedding of a compact manifold in such a way that the critical points are all nondegenerate. This discussion is generalized in the next chapter to critical and noncritical levels. The author motivates well the study of the neighborhood of a critical level by first discussing the properties of critical levels in the torus. The changing of the topology as one sweeps through the critical levels in this chapter is viewed as the process of spherical modification in the next one. The author does define what is meant by spherical modification, but does not use the usual terminology to discuss it, such as &quot;cobordism&quot; etc. he does however discuss the process of isotopy, and illustrates general position by means of intersections of curves. He illustrates these results in chapter 7 in the classification of two-dimensional manifolds. The usual proof is done in terms of simplicial complexes, but here the author proves it for differentiable 2-manifolds using critical point theory. The author ends the book by discussing how the subject could be pursued if the tools of algebraic topology were brought in. He discusses the killing of homotopy groups and motivates the theorem that an orientable compact 3-dimensional manifold can be obtained from a 3-sphere by cutting out a finite number of disjoint solid tori and filling the holes again with solid tori, with suitable identification of boundaries. He does not however prove when such constructions lead to the same 3-manifold, for this would lead to a resolution of the three-dimensional Poincare conjecture....."},{"Title":"Differential topology; first steps (Mathematics monograph series)","review":"Wallace's \\"Differential Topology\\" is certainly the most elementary book on the subject that I've seen (and I've read dozens of such books). I wouldn't even say it is for \\"advanced undergraduates\\" - it could, and should, be read with only a background in multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra. It was intended to introduce the topological aspects of the subject without too much analytic or algebraic formalism, to build up a student's intuition. Technical details in this thin book are kept to a minimum and much of the presentation is done pictorially. Another notable feature is that it covers more advanced material, such as surgery, that most elementary books do not. However, due to a lack of rigor in some proofs as well as the limited range of topics covered, graduate students, and even senior undergrads who have studied topology, would be better served by higher-level introductory books, such as Guillemin & Pollack'sDifferential Topology, Milnor'sTopology from the Differentiable ViewpointorCollected Papers of John Milnor. Volume III: Differential Topology, or Broecker & Jaenich'sIntroduction to Differential Topology, although none of these books cover surgery. Another possibility is to read Gauld's,Differential Topology: An Introduction (Dover Books on Mathematics), which is a more advanced version of this book, but that has some problems of its own (cf. my review of it). This is not a textbook, but rather is designed for self-study; ideally it should be read as preparation for one of the above books or concurrently.The presentation is so heavily weighted toward topology, there's no mention of analytical concepts such as differential forms, integration, metrics, vector bundles, or Lie groups, or even Sard's theorem or transversality, so don't expect this to be a substitute for Lee'sIntroduction to Smooth Manifolds, Lang'sDifferential and Riemannian Manifolds (Graduate Texts in Mathematics), or Barden & Thomas'sAn Introduction to Differential Manifolds. Instead Wallace introduces Morse theory and surgery (which he refers to by the alternative term \\"spherical modification\\"), and uses them to present a proof of the classification of 2-d surfaces that is different from the most common one based upon triangulations. He also includes standard results on embeddings, submanifolds, and immersions, as well as an introductory chapter on point-set topology for those who have no familiarity with the area. The amount of general topology covered is very small - only enough to define open sets, continuity, connectedness, and compactness - so if you haven't studied the subject already you'll need to learn it elsewhere, whereas if you have studied it, the first chapter could be skimmed or skipped.The hallmark of this book is its informality, since the purpose of the book was to develop new students' topological and geometric intuition, before they become acquainted with more abstract concepts such as algebraic topology. Many of the proofs are not that rigorous, as steps are skipped and details omitted, and a number of important results are only cited or sketched. Sometimes pictures are relied upon for key steps in a proof, as most of proofs proceed by using embeddings in Euclidean space. This informality is both the biggest advantage of the book, as it can be read and grasped relatively quickly by even very inexperienced students, without getting bogged down in technicalities, and also its biggest weakness, since it is important for budding mathematicians to become proficient in proving theorems rigorously. At some point all the handwaving gets to be a little too much for my tastes.One omission of this sort that I find particularly irritating is his almost complete failure to pay any attention to the differential structure of manifolds. Virtually never is a manifold actually shown to be smooth; even when a certain manipulation is asserted to produce homeomorphic manifolds, surgery is applied as if they were diffeomorphic. He practically uses the 2 words interchangeably, and doesn't even justify this by mentioning that all topological 2-manifolds can be smoothed. See Gauld for an example of how this detail should be handled properly.In addition, some of the proofs use roundabout or inelegant methods, even when they are not necessarily easier to understand. For example, the proof of the existence of an embedding into Euclidean space for any manifold, rather than using the standard trick of having 2 nested sets of open coverings (which the author uses elsewhere), instead uses the explicit form of the bump function (the only proof the I can ever recall doing this), necessitating a tedious calculation, and embeds in a space that is of much, much higher dimension than necessary. His proof that an injective immersion of a compact manifold is an embedding is similarly convoluted and inefficient. Also, the proofs of cancellation of certain surgeries and rearrangement of surgeries are much harder to follow than the standard ones using handles or Morse theory, although in this case those given here at least have the benefit of being more elementary.Oddly, for a book that has such a wealth of pictures and relies so much upon visualization, there are a couple of key points late in the book where a picture would have been a huge help, namely, on p. 106, when discussing rearrangements of surgeries, and especially on pp. 123-5, in the discussion of cancellation of surgeries. You will need to draw careful pictures to see what he is talking about.There are exercises frequently sprinkled throughout the text that are used in fill in important missing steps in proofs, so doing them is really essential to learning the material. In fact, parts of the book just consist of a series of exercises with the author's guidance, such as the classification of non-orientable surfaces or the proof of the Morse lemma. However, I feel that some of them are perhaps demanding too much from beginners at this stage, as they are normally proved explicitly in even the more advanced books on the subject.The are few mathematical typos, with only a couple being serious. On p. 124 it reads \\"phi and phi prime...respectively\\" when the author intends to say, \\"phi prime and phi in reverse...respectively.\\" On p. 107 the number 0 is missing from the sentence \\"modifications of type on the 2-sphere\\" (they are of type 0). And most amusingly, on pp. 40-41, after constructing 2 open coverings, with the closure of one inside the other, the author explains that this is not an \\"unnecessary complication\\" but rather a \\"convenience,\\" and then seemingly proceeds to not make use of this. However, he really is using it, but the reader cannot see that because in 3 places there is a prime on the variable U that should not be there.In short, for students with virtually no experience with differential topology, this is a great place to start, but it is only a small \\"first step.\\""},{"Title":"Differential topology; first steps (Mathematics monograph series)","review":"deep mathematics made crystal clear and even elementary (to the senior college math major).there are very few professional research mathematicians who write for beginners as does andrew wallace. i recommend all his books, although i have only read three of them, this one which classifies surfaces via morse theory, his intro to alg top via fundamental groups, and his other intro to alg top via covering spaces, classification of surfaces by triangulation, and fundamental groupsfor those who do not know, morse theory is a beautiful and simple geometric theory that extends the second derivative test from calculus of two variables. think back at the picture of a surface in three space, the graph of a function of two variables, and recall the concept of a \\"level curve\\", or curve in the domain where the function is constant.These level curves arise from passing a horizontal plane through the graph surface and projecting the intersection curve down to the x,y plane. In the case of a paraboloid, or bowl, graph of z = X^2 + Y^2, the curves look like circles or ellipses getting wider as you slice higher and higher. Thus the level curves down in the x,y plane form concentric closed curves. It is especially interesting that at the center, the level set is not a curve at all, but a single point, the minimum point of the graph.If we consider a saddle surface, graph of Z = X^2 - Y^2, the slice by the horizontal plane through the origin is two lines, and all others, above and below, are hyperbolas. Thus again one can see from the geometry of the level curves, the geometry of the original graph surface. Here the second derivative test says there is no extremum.We also know that for an infinite \\"trough\\" Z = X^2, in X,Y,Z space, the test fails, as any small perturbation can change the nature of the critical point at the origin. Morse theory says that, just as the second derivative test describes the shape of the graph at points where the second derivatives form an invertible matrix, so also the geometry of a surface can be reconstructed from the level curves of a single function defined on the surface, and having only such non degenerate critical points.I.e. if at all critical points, the second derivative is non degenerate, then the geometry of the surface is entirely determined by knowing the index of the second derivative matrix at those critical points. E.g. a sphere is characterized by supporting a smooth function with exactly two critical points, one max and one min.In between two successive critical points, the geometry of the surface does not change, and it looks like a \\"cylinder\\" i.e. a product of an interval with a single level curve. A torus, or surface of a doughnut, is characterized by having a function with one max, one min, and two saddle points. this is really making the solution theory of differential equations come alive and visible."},{"Title":"Differential topology; first steps (Mathematics monograph series)","review":"Wallace's is an ideal book for the budding mathematician with some interest in topology and familiarity with basic real analysis (e.g., Bartle).

(In other words, complete classification of these spaces is not as hard as one may have been led to believe elsewhere.)

I will therefore not repeat what others have so well said. In reading it, I was reminded of an experience I had while reading another wonderful book, Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky. There, a Jewish writer wrongly takes for granted the enduring power of classical music in the midst of a heinous invasion.My father, born a poor man, was blessed with a college education as a benefit from serving during World War II. On hearing classical music for the first time in a college dorm, he raced up several flight of stairs, pounded on the door of the room from which the music came, to ask a fellow student what was that magnificent sound? He made sure his children should not be similarly deprived by surrounding us with that treasured music. Yet, like Shakespeare, it is now puzzingly gone, save perhaps among those foreign born or gay.Here, the author points the blame to a mass culture determinedly aimed at selling to children as that market which, at least at one time, offered the highest profit. I am not entirely convinced of this explanation as both Shakespeare and classical music still survive among a small but delighted audience of mostly amateur players. Yet, it does seem that the mainstream no longer values wisdom or its fountainhead, serenity. That both were venerated after the cataclysm of world war and are now forgotten in an age of immediate gratification does make me wonder if Burt isn't onto something when he calls the result unfinished mourning. In opposition to trendy cultural critics, setting the record straight by carefully examining what was once treasured, an integral task of mourning, may yet turn out to be the most political work."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"I ran across this book while reading an essay in Lingua Franca about Shakespeare porn.

Concentrating mostly on film but attending as well to television sit-coms, Burt offers penetrating insight into everything from mainstream adaptations of Shakespeare to &quot;low&quot; spin-offs in which Shakespeare's language almost entirely disappears. Burt explores both what film and mass media have done to Shakespeare and also what Shakespeare enables our culture to do trhough film and other electronic media. Readers intersted in this book will be happy to know that Burt has since edited a related collection entitled Shakespeare After Mass Media and has co-edited Shakespeare, the Movie II."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"I loved the hardcover edition of this book so much I just had to buy the paperback too, especially when I saw the new cover. While the hardcover version does it have its charm, the new cover is much sleeker. The large pink XXXXs really stand out! The new preface is really great. Burt discusses new films that were released after the publication of the hardcover like Shakespeare in Love and A Midsummer Night's Dream (the opera soundtrack). Burt also has brilliant readings of what he calls &quot;Shakesploi flicks,&quot; Never Been Kissed and As You Liked It. Get this version now!"},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"One doesn't usually expect to find oneself laughing when reading a book of criticism written by an academic, much less a book on Shakespeare. But Burt's book is frequently just that, funny to the point of making me laugh out loud. Burt has a refreshingly off-beat sense of humor, and the materials he has discovered--such as an adult movie version of Hamlet--aer themselves often hilarious as well, though not always intentionally so. But far from being just a laugh riot, the book is also a serious, critically sophisticated analysis of Shakespeare's fate incontemporary mass media, where much of hte lnagugae is cut or confined to well-known quotations. Burt's final chapter on films about teaching Shakespeare is quite moving, and Burt has the courage to raise difficult questions without pretending he is able to answer them. He is right to think that the questions are more important than the answers. Burt is to be congratulated for writing his book in a clear and engaging prose style without sacrificing the complexity of his thought."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"I happened to be doing research for my thesis on Shakespeare in the university library and, while looking for other books, I was intrigued by the three XXXs in the title of Burt's book on the shelf, so I pulled it off and looked through it. What a daring work of cultural criticism! When I saw the chapters on Shakespeare porn, I marvelled both at the courage of the man to write such a book and how at the publisher who took it on. Of course, I check it out and read it. I especially was drawn to the chapter on action films and Burt's point that while the films cannibalize others, no one in the films ever eats; the characters are anorexic. The book is full of similarly wonderful insights. I am a cinephile, and very much appreciated Burt's quite hip approach to ShaXXXspeare. Now, it's back to those other, rather staid books of Shakespeare criticism, I was orginally looking for."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Shakespeare's reception in contemporarzy culture. This is an accessible and very hip read."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"Burt's brilliant book is provocatively devoted to, among other adaptations and citations of Shakespeare in mass media, &quot;bardcore&quot; pornorgraphic adaptations such as A Midsummer Night's Cream, the Playboy Twelfth Night (a softcore rock musical) Romeo and Julian, and Hamlet: For the Love of Ophelia. All of these and more are listed on his excellent personal naughtyprofessor website. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Shakespeare and popular culture, and I am looking forward to Burt's edited book Shakespeare After Mass Media."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"Richard Burt has to be the most interesting critic of Shakespeare alive and is no doubt a charismatic professor. I've seen his Shakespeare course website and only wish that I could have taken a course like his when I went to college. But having to settle for this brilliant and often hilarious book on Shakespeare's afterlives in modern American mass media, mostly film, is not at all bad. I highly recommend it. Check out Burt's personal website too. It's a gas."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"Whatever you think about Shakespeare, it is impossible not to agree with the points Burt makes in this book. His analysis is right on the money and you will never be able to look at Shakespearean movies or literature in the same way. A fantastic book and a must read."},{"Title":"Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares, Revised Edition: Queer Theory and American Kiddie Culture","review":"One of the many strengths of Burt's truly excellent book is that it not only discusses Shakespeare adaptations but uses Shakespeare, or of ShaXXXspeares, to discuss post-war American popular culture. Burt's theory of the loser as critic has ramifications for all criticism, not just Shakespeare. This is a profound, original, and engaging book."},{"Title":"Building Yourself: Putting Your Success Together One Piece at a Time","review":"I purchased Building Yourself because it seemed a little different in the world of self-help books, and I was presently surprised. There isn't an ounce of fill or fat in this book. It's obvious that the author, Elliot Essman, likes to see people succeed. This is a practical book, without all the usual &quot;rah rah.&quot; The book has ten major sections on life areas such as &quot;Skills&quot; and &quot;Strength&quot; (they all begin with the letter &quot;S&quot;), each divided into ten bite-sized parts, with an inspirational quote for each of the 100 sections.

It seems that no matter which of the (numbered) sections you turn to, his crisp writing clears your head. He's got the whole thing on the web now in a revised version at buildingyourself.com/build along with a lot of other success material I've been able to really use in my insurance sales practice.

The author creatively guides and helps you formulate that game plan that we are all too inexperienced or fearful to do on our own. I believe he is able to do this extremely well because of his knowledge and \`feel' for the intricacies of our human nature. He understands our fears and senses our potential. Through \`Building Yourself' the author deftly leads us step by step towards realizing our ambition."},{"Title":"Pulitzer Prize reader (The Popular living classics library)","review":"This book was published in 1961 and contained 61 works by 55 American writers who'd won the Pulitzer Prize. The prize, established in the United States in 1917 and awarded annually, is given in various categories such as letters and drama, history, biography/autobiography and verse. It honors distinguished literary achievement by American authors, preferably dealing with American life, and distinguished work on the nation's history. The selections included for each author in this collection weren't necessarily the ones that won them the Pulitzer.The selections covered the period from the 1890s to the 1960s, with particular focus on the 30s, 40s and 50s. Writers of fiction included Wharton, Cather, Lewis, Wilder, Aiken, Buck, Steinbeck, Warren, Michener, Wouk, Hersey, Marquand and Cozzens. A short, early play by Tennessee Williams was the only drama included. Writers of history included Parrington, Turner, Nevins, Carl Van Doren, Tuchman and Samuel Eliot Morison. Poets included Teasdale, Sandburg, Robinson, Frost, Ben&eacute;t, MacLeish, Lowell, Stevens, Bishop, Wilbur and Auden, the English poet who became a U.S. citizen.As the book's introduction noted, the anthology traced the literary tastes of successive decades. As such, it contained pieces that viewed from the present were both lasting and ephemeral. Among the former were excepts from Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1961), Henry Adams' essay Mont St. Michel and Chartres (1905), Frederick Jackson Turner's essay The Significance of the Frontier in American History (1893), Vernon Parrington's history Main Currents in American Thought (1930), John F. Kennedy's history Profiles in Courage (1956), and James Agee's essay on silent-film comedy. Other works enjoyed were an excerpt from Allen Drury's political thriller Advise and Consent (1959), Allan Nevins' analysis of the character of Henry Ford (1954) and Samuel Eliot Morison's colorful description of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus (1942). For me, the anthology's historical and biographical writing was particularly worthwhile.In many of the short stories, the characters struggled, usually successfully, against ignorance, prejudice or snobbery, and deepened their understanding of others. Many of these pieces could be described as optimistic and progressive. An example was a work by Marquand set on a Hawaiian island in the early 19th century, when a New England shipowner's son confronted a captain who tried to cheat the natives. In a work by MacKinlay Cantor, a Greek-American veteran of World War I faced down xenophobic threats from members of the KKK in a small town.An exception to the optimism was Aiken's \\"Impulse\\" (1932), in which the scandal of being caught shoplifting resulted in a man's losing his wife, children and friends. Prose focused on WWII was limited to one of Michener's tales of the South Pacific and Hersey's factual account of the sinking of John F. Kennedy's PT boat.Reading many of the pieces was like looking at black and white photographs from a bygone era. For the most part, the influence of modernism seemed small except in some of the poetry. Writing by Faulkner was included, but it was his 1949 Nobel Prize speech, not his fiction. Writing by Arthur Miller was included, but it was an essay, not his plays. In the prose, irony and cynicism were almost entirely lacking, except in Drury's novel set among the nation's political leadership and a tongue-in-cheek essay by Bernard DeVoto on how whiskey and patriotism went hand in hand. Short stories included references to women attending dances called \\"assemblies,\\" matrons pinning full veils over their faces before going out in public, and family members sending postcards to their loved ones a day after leaving home, to tell them they'd arrived safely in town.As the compilers noted, work by prominent figures of the time such as Dreiser, Fitzgerald, Eliot, Nathanael West and the critic Edmund Wilson never received the Pulitzer, and thus nothing by them was included here. Neither was work by Lardner, Anderson, Wolfe, O'Hara, O'Connor, or the critics Mencken and Mumford. Hemingway and Eugene O'Neill did receive the prize, but their work wasn't selected here either. Absent also was writing by authors from, say, African-American, Italian-American or Jewish-American backgrounds, except for Wouk and Weidman or, for example, any of the New York Intellectuals, let alone Asian-Americans. Obviously, work by such writers would win recognition from the Pulitzer trustees in later years.It appears that no equivalent popular anthology of Pulitzer Prize-winning authors of fiction, history or drama has been published since this one nearly a half-century ago. It'd make a welcome continuation of this collection."},{"Title":"Merchants of Debt: Kkr and the Mortgaging of American Business With a New Afterword by the Author","review":"This book covers the largest and probably the best of the leveraged buyout firms that became so popular and profitable in the 80's. What I would like to say is that this was an outstanding book that is the leader of the class on this topic. You get a wonderfully documented and rich description of the group of high finance leaders during the 80's Junk Bond and M&amp;A scandals. The author also provides a very readable explanation of the tools used in both the legitimate and illegal side of this issue. This is just a detailed and exciting book; the extra pages and detail do not slow it down at all. The personal descriptions of the people behind the \\"KKR\\" names is very interesting, it is something that many massive ego's could actually work together even if they are family.If you are interested in this topic then I would suggest you also read &quot;Predator's Ball&quot; and \\"Den of Thieves\\".

Of course its much more than that because the selection of Johnny Carson's replacement is arguably one most important decisions made in TV history. Not only do get to meet Letterman and Leno up close and personal, we also get to be a fly on wall inside the offices and boardrooms of some of the most powerful people in America --the entertainment czars. We learn about the differences of philosophy between the East Coast and the Left Coast (California)and learn that there are actually some pretty decent suits among the snakes. Carter does a really good job at keeping himself out the story, but it still often reads like satire --funny and cutting. The people are fascinating especially Jay and Dave. I'm thrilled that NBC was forced to make the right --and most profitable-- decision by sticking with Jay (a truly nice guy -- I speak from experience having met him and he comes off that way in the book) even though at the time the book was finished it looked bad for the Peacock Network. The updated paperback edition is the one to buy because an added chapter tells about the Hugh Grant incident on Jay's show which of course was the turning point for The Tonight Show. This is a great book about the industry."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"This is a must-read for any Leno and Letterman fan who wants the inside scoop on exactly what went on behind the screens during the fight over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. It is easy to follow and it mentions all the key players.As I'm in the UK, and we only got the Letterman and Leno shows in 1994, it details everything that happened that we didn't already know.The only distracting thing about the book is that it swings Letterman's way. As it is a couple of years old now, the last chapter (Carter's own feelings on the matter) doesn't ring entirely true.It is, however, an entertaining and insightful book giving a great view of network politics and contracts."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I finished it in under a week, because it was so hard to put down.Recommended for fans of the shows, especially with an interest in the television industry. Even though it is quite an old story now, it's still very interesting. The author does a great job of telling the story from both sides of the fence, with a complex cast of characters."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"I goot this book when it came out. It is an excellent read and gives a great idea of the war for the late night time slot that went on in the 90's. The main problem is that even though the authors thinks he is impartial he actually drools a bit too much over Letterman. I myself never understood the fascination for the smug letterman that a lot of Americans seem to have had over the years. While it is true that sometimes Jay Leno comes over as somewhat more popular, he is actually funny in a nice way, whereas letterman, even if funny at times, comes across as a self-adoring and arrogant intellectual. Anyway both are OK and have thier good sides but the author actually has a secret admiration for Letterman that is not allways understandable. Still it is a great book with great insight into what went on behind the scenes on TV."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"This is as good of a drama as anything on television -- or about television.

This is a must read for anyone interested in the history and significance of late night television."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"Bill Carter's THE LATE SHIFT chronicles the flawed transition of Jay Leno in succeeding Johnny Carson as host of \\"The Tonight Show\\" in 1992. The villian that drives the narrative in the first half of the book is Leno's out of control manager Helen Kushnick. She ruthlessly wins the day for Leno in getting him Carson's chair, but then she keeps on pushing and manipulating to the point that both NBC and Leno let her go. The second half of the book is driven by Letterman's decision to stay at NBC or jump ship to CBS. Described as talented as least a hundred times by Carter, Letterman's insecurities make the final decision totally unpredictable. Described as nice as least two hundred times by Carter, Leno has a simplicity that works for NBC's brass. He'll go anywhere, do anything with the affliates to promote himself and the show. The level of detail of the in-fighting at NBC indicates that the losers (those who supported Letterman) were quite willing to talk to Carter, and Carter takes full advantage of it to show the incompentence of the NBC suits every step along the way."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"I haven't read the paperback edition-I know it has been updated.

One caveat: Carter does begin to repeat himself toward the end of the book which is why I didn't rate this book a 10."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"I'm a HUGE Letterman fan and this totally took me by surprise!An excellent read for late night fans(of either show)!"},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"Detailed description of the passage of the Tonight Show from Johnny Carson to Jay Leno, and David Letterman's accompanying move from NBC to CBS. Much of the book remains extremely topical given the current excitement surrounding Conan O'Brien's departure from the Tonight Show, which he had taken over from Jay Leno last year.The book has some fascinating descriptions of the backgrounds of Leno and Letterman, from childhood on. It gives a very good description of the intricate television politics at play.Unfortunately, despite the topicality of much of the book, with the passage of time three problems are apparent.Firstly, the television business is obviously much different now than it was in the early 90s. So a lot of the business analysis, although no doubt of historical interest, has only limited contemporary relevance.Secondly, the long and detailed disussions of exactly which executives did which are simply not that fascinating any more, since the executives in question, presumably, are long gone. I had trouble keeping track of all the different names and positions of all the different players, some of whom are only briefly and cursorily introduced.Finally, the natural question raised by the book is exactly how everybody turned out. Although there is a sort of afterword describing it, the afterword itself is out of date.Probably what needs to happen is for an updated version of the book to be published.I should mention as well that the book contains a number of extremely incendiary accusations, the most notorious of which being that Leno's agent placed articles in the press impelling Johnny Carson to retire. I cannot speak for the accuracy of these, and they rely on anonymous sourcing.Nevertheless, clearly a huge amount of work went into the book, and it must have been engrossing reading when it was published a decade ago. And parts of it remain intriguing if not fascinating."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"The movie was mildly entertaining, so I decided to check the book out. However, I found myself losing interest in the book quite fast.The ending result is anti-climatic, of course, since we all know the result of the late-night battle.The behind the scenes details weren't all that compelling. Just a bunch of head strong, egotistical executives fighting over who they thought deserved Carson's seat as the King of Latenight.The only insightful part of the book to me was learning how Conan O'brien has won the Late Night show. I had always wondered how such a relative unknown had won the part."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"I am a huge Letterman fan and thought Bill Carter spent too much time in this book focusing on Jay Leno.Ive re-read it a couple of times and came up with the same conclusion.The book was far better than that rediculous movie."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"Bill Carter has written an extraordinary book.Structurally-given the mass of information,biographical detail and anecdotes involved-this could have ended up as a mess,but in fact it is clear,coherent and quite exceptionally well-balanced.Carter has to tell a fairly complicated (certainly very convoluted)story,and he does so brilliantly.He also has to find space to acknowledge and evaluate a broad range of opinions,and,again,he does so with remarkable discipline and even-handedness.Even if one knows little about the magnificent Letterman and the super-professional Leno,this book is still too interesting,too insightful and too fair-minded to miss."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"A thoroughly entertaining and insightful look at these two personalities and the even more entertaining and often comical workings of corporate broadcasting.

Letterman, by far the more deserving of the &quot;King of Late Night&quot; crown following Carson's unceremonious ousting, tried to win by being the best at what he does. Leno's camp won by using strongarm tactics, bullying, and underhandedness. Even Leno's show &quot;borrows&quot; rather heavily from Dave's old show, partly because his people lured Letterman's chief writers to their side. Leno may be a decent guy (I hear), but his management quite literally stole The Tonight Show for him. Dave was hoping to be let in through the front door, but Leno's camp broke in through a window. The companion HBO movie treatment of this book is also a very entertaining and enlightening dramatization of the basics of this ordeal."},{"Title":"The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno & the Network Battle for the Night","review":"Man, I have read this book beginning to end maybe 10 times.It is addictive.

Had this genius been more influential in philosophical circles, academic philosophy might have life today. But that would be impossible--because Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche were not academics! It is easy to be a Kantian or an Hegelian, it puts your mind at rest or at the least anaesthetises the passions. Even the leftist academics today with all their pretense do not live up to their various European philosopher-kings.

All too superhuman are my expectations."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"This book is a delight! Schopenhauer is one of those philosophers who knows how to write. If you enjoy wit and pithy aphorisms you will love this book"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"On pages 61 through 79 of SCHOPENHAUER / ESSAYS AND APHORISMS, Translated by R.J. Hollingdale, we find the most mature consideration in philosophy of the topics \\"On Affirmation and Denial of the Will to Live,\\" \\"On the Indestructibility of Our Essential Being by Death,\\" and \\"On Suicide.\\" Schopenhauer is particularly concerned about religious views, considering a number of major doctrines, including the condemnation of suicide, for which his answer to religion is that suicide must be condemned with extraordinary zeal by those who are stuck with the view \\"that all things were very good\\" (p. 78) in order that the voluntary death of one or more people who did not agree might not be considered a reproach of those who continue to live:It is another instance of the obligatory optimism of these religions, which denounces self-destruction so as not to be denounced by it. (p. 78).The Doom or Dumber Question goes right to the heart of the inability of people collectively clinging to religious or philosophical concepts to make any essential determinations about how the future is going to blow their minds all over again. Religion and philosophy may compete in the ability to express \\"affirmation of the will to life, through which life is assured for all time, however swiftly its figures and forms may succeed one another.\\" (p. 62). The events of September 11, 2001 were such a contrast to the expectations of most of the victims that it is a challenge to understand them in the context of the perpetrators, who exhibited a desire to thwart such expectations. As Schopenhauer put it, \\"The other, by symbols of suffering and death, expresses denial of the will to life and redemption from a world in which death and the Devil reign.\\" (p. 62). By allowing himself to represent grace for those who are \\"capable of thinking a little more deeply,\\" (p. 63) it is easy for Schopenhauer to assume superiority \\"to those who refuse to penetrate to the heart of the matter but prefer its superficialities.\\" (p. 63). People who aren't sure of anything except that they are killing people are in danger of being able to agree with Schopenhauer on the point, \\"That our existence itself implies guilt is proved by the fact of death.\\" (p. 63). Later, he is willing to grant eternity in those who are capable of being the whatever who anyone is:The more clearly you become conscious of the frailty, vanity and dream-like quality of all things, the more clearly will you also become conscious of the eternity of your own inner being; because it is only in contrast to this that the aforesaid quality of things becomes evident, just as you perceive the speed at which a ship is going only when looking at the motionless shore, not when looking into the ship itself. (pp. 68-69).That ship is probably not as famous as the Titanic, but Schopenhauer's work was published by 1851, long before anyone could have guessed what was going to happen to the Kursk when underwater explosions became a risk that modern sailors could die from in large numbers. History might show that a few more ships sunk, too, but instead of going into the risks of navigation, Schopenhauer's interest in a deep philosophy took him a long way from really caring about any individual:Individualities are a matter of indifference to the will; it is not concerned with them, although it seems to be so, because the individual has no knowledge of it except in himself. (p. 76).That might usually be true, but one of the interesting things about September 11, 2001 was how a few events on that day really made a lot of people wonder what the perpetrators were thinking."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"This is a bad book. A really bad book. Hell, it's even a dangerous book. Anyone that takes Schoperhanuer seriously, is going to expect a rotten world, prolong a rotten world, and thus fortify the self fulfilling prophecy that nothing good has happened, will happen, and can happen. Fortunately this entire foundation is grounded on extremely shoddy philosophy.Schopenhauer was known in Germany as that guy who lectured in an empty room, while Hegel filled the auditorium. This isn't surprising, Hegel was conducting Philosophy, and Schopenhauer was conducting shrill whining before a live audience of one. If you're going to pay a college to teach you philosophy, listening to the equivalent of a comedian without jokes, isn't a frugal investment.Gramsci had a famous saying: Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will. Schopenhauer would twist this into, a pessimistic will, guarantees a pessimistic intellect. For Schopenhauer this is an ontological truth of the world, literally, there is one grand will, that exist independently of the phenomenal world, and it expresses itself in living beings, as a voracious Hobbesian creature that riddles us with torment, misery, and pain. Kant's things in themselves are really this one thing, the will, in itself, and through us (and animals). How does Schopenhauer know this? How has he taken Kant's masterpiece and transcended the phenomenal world, into the essence of the noumenon? Simple: sparse, intuition. It's rather ironic than that when Schopenhauer goes on to explain what the world would look like without human subjects, he maintains all the properties of mind: space, time, causal relations, in existence. Clearly he didn't understand Kant very well. One cannot explain the world without subjects, or at the very least, that description shouldn't literally mirror our phenomenal depiction of it.What's even more asinine is how petulant and hostile he was to Hegelian philosophy, when his own philosophy merely replaced Hegel's Absolute, or Geist, with a Will. Whereas Hegel was a genius, with extreme philosophical cunning, able to piece together the necessary conclusions of his ontological foundation, and at least project some form of progress upon mankind, Schopenhauer leaves us with unconnected bits and pieces. There is no progress. There is no history. There is only misery from time immemorial.From these ridiculous ontological certainties, Schopenhauer moves on to explain to us that women are trifling, idiotic, subspecies. The businessman is the most authentic human being. The majority of the population requires religion because they're essentially a brain stem, without frontal lobes, and Monarchies are the NATURAL EXPRESSION of human beings (I guess he never read a history book nor inquired into an anthropological text). Freedom of the press is dangerous, and authoritative ruling is universal and ubiquitous, thus necessary, and never eradicable. Any attempts at ethical behavior is really futile, all we can do is stare at each other in recognition of our own self-torment. Every once and a while a genius may arise amongst us, but overall 99% of us most be certain that we'll never achieve anything except the occasional brief mitigation of pure despair.What's really so ironic about this ontological certainty, with its barbarous conclusions, is that Schopenhauer only writes in Aphorisms and brief points. This is the guy who claims to have found the essence to all of reality, and unlike Hegel, he can't properly systemize anything. All of his essays, on any subject, are helter skelter, scattered, internally contradictory, and fail to paint a systematic picture beyond: life sucks, then you die, ass hole.Now I can understand why Schopenhauer held such pessimism, and he's brave enough to point out that the world is filled with suffering, depravity, torment, and pain. The Romantic Movement was being squashed by the material and social reality of an ever growing industrializing, capitalistic, heartless, mode of production. Atomizations of the people, and fractioning of the state, were necessary results. Alienation was subsequent. The bourgeois revolutions were replacing the tyranny of 1, by the tyranny of the 1%. Fortunately Marxism, and other socialist thinkers offered the necessary optimism to Schopenhauer's defeatist pessimism. And thus Schopenhauer sat in the dustbin of history for some time. Now with the failure of Capitalism to be surmounted, and any chance at a proper romanticism - that incorporates a diverse and flourishing natural environment - is leading Philosophers, and many readers, back to Schopenhauer. (He alleviates the readers initial guilt as being a full blown hedonist, I suspect...)This is why the man is dangerous, instead of a revival of optimism, and a good Marxist vaccination against a static view of miserable history, we get poor philosophy, terrible ontology, an incoherent ethic, and certainty in failure."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"This book is a classic. I love it and cart it around everywhere- so much so that my wife took to calling me \`Schopey,' soon after we married. Oh what a kidder... The text in question is basically an abbreviated form of \\"Parerga and Paralipomena,\\" a collection of, you guessed it, essays and aphorisms that Arthur published towards the end of his life. In fact, he owed much of his early popularity to these little bits of brain, blood and bile- they paved the way for the interest in his earlier, more thorough and more intimidating work- \`The World as Will and Representation,' his central text. Intense, brooding, and enthrallingly lucid (a trait much lacking in philosophy in general and German philosophy in particular), these little pensees and barbs will provide you with much enjoyment, quotes, quips and boundless food for thought. If you are at all the kind of person who enjoys reading, or if you are buying books with such a person in mind (and if you weren't I don't see how you would have ended up here) I cannot say enough good things about this tiny volume!Whether or not you agree with Schopenhauer's central philosophic themes, his high-jacking/hybridization of Kantian metaphysics and Eastern Vedic/Buddhist Scripture, his pessimistic misanthropy, his irrational and intuitive bent, his (huge) influence on psychology and psychoanalysis, his dismissal of Judeo-Christian religion, or his overbearing arrogance- he is not a thinker to be dismissed lightly. I disagree with him on practically everything important (as did Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy notwithstanding), except his scathing misanthropy and his views on opera (page 163- he loathed it by the way, as a philistine piling up of styles, an \`unmusical invention for unmusical minds...'), but so what?His views, maxims and opinions are straightforwardly put with all the deceptive elegance of a minor key Chopin Nocturne. A refreshing break from the tireless jargon-juggling of contemporary, pomo, academic charlatans... And the man was brilliant. The kind of brilliance that engenders humility in readers and makes young, would-be philosophers reconsider their choice of profession. You cannot help but enter into dialogue with this man. And hey- All you young, winsome, despairing, romantically-inclined teenagers- take note! This guy was the real deal, it takes serious cajones to spit in the face of the Enlightenment and proclaim to the progress-minded 19th C. that, \\"Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of existence, then our existence must have no object whatever,\\" (which is the first sentence in this nice little book) and then back that statement up with serious argumentation. And as a literary influence Schopenhauer is in a league entirely of his own. Thomas Mann is unthinkable without him (well, and Nietzcsche). Borges once opined that the only thinkers he thought accurately depicted the world were Schopenhauer and Berkeley.Finally, The introduction by Hollingdale is .. superb. It is possibly the best brief introduction to Schopenhauer (by way of Kant and 19th C. trends in German philosophy) that I have come across; it manages to be (simultaneously) anecdotal, psychological, historical, humorous and analytic- all in under 40 pages. No easy achievement, that. It should be noted that Hollingdale is a fine scholar/translator; his work with the late, great Walter Kaufmann on a variety of his Nietzsche translations comes to mind, as does his own fantastic critical biography, \`Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy,' which still may be the best work of its kind in terms of its approachability.My only beef with Hollingdale is minor: he doesn't mention the effects of the \`Nachmearz,' (a period in the mid 19th C. Germany, following revolts in 1848, wherein the public became disenchanted with \`academic' philosophy and turned to more literary-outsider intellectuals) as influential in producing the kind of cultural climate in which a thinker and writer such as Schopenhauer could find a mass readership. This is odd because in \`The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche,' Hollingdale discusses (at length) the far-reaching effects of said cultural phenomenon in producing the legends that permeate the widespread public perception of Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer...But I digress. Cheap copies of this are abound. Do yourself a massive favor, live a little- take a chance, as Nietzsche did, when he was a college student, nosing about in a bookstore..."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"Insighful ideas written in lucid language (very rare for a philosopher) with thoughts on existence, suicide, women, religion, politics, ethics, aesthetics, psychology, and other sundry ideas.Scopenhauer's ideas are a reflection of the post-Kantian era. The Zeitgeist of spiritual nihilism, which is nothing more than greater minds expressing the religious tendency. Scopenhauer seems like one who finds very little value in the world but he doesn't reverberate the nihilist slogan, &quot;Since all is false, everyhing is permitted.&quot; He at once preaches to us that the world is inherently meaningless and that all movement is the result of an obscure force he calls &quot;Will,&quot; and yet he proscribes compasion and empathy, as can be exemplified by his outrage over slavery and his sensitivity to animals.While it's easier to tear down walls then to build them up, I nevertheless have a few problems with his ontological presuppositions.Scopenhauer writes that his &quot;ethics is ... actually in the spirit of the New Testament..&quot; obviously appreciating it's ascetic nature yet in his dialogue on religion, he castigates Christianity and surprisingly exalts the Greeks (who affirmed life and did not practice an official religion ), exemplifying the superiority of their metaphysics to that of Christian metaphysics. He does this by comparing the periods in which these two systems reigned over their respective societies. The result of the Greek outlook was &quot;the fairest unfolding of humanity, a spelndid state structure, wise laws, a carefully balanced legal administration, rationally regulated freedom, all the arts, together with poetry and philosophy, at their peark, creating works which after thousands of years still stand as unequalled models of their kind, almost as the production of higher beings whom we can never hope to emulate..&quot; while when Christianity took over as the reigning religion in Europe there was a &quot;hideous ignorance and darkness of mind, and in consequence intolerance, quarrelling over beliefs, religious wars, crusades, persecution of heretics and inquisitions...&quot; etc. From my perspective, Christianity's dogmatism and its devaluation of life caused the cultural stagnation in the dark ages (Why champion reason and seek insight through philosophical inquiry when the catechism of Christianity has all of the answers?) but the devaluation seems to be what Scopenhauer is attracted to and yet he fails to realize that. Nevertheless, Scopenhauer ends his dialogue on religion with Demopheles declaring to Philalethes, &quot;Let us see, rather that, like Janus - or better, like Yama, the Brahmin god of death - religion has two faces, one very friendly, one very gloom: you have had your eyes fixed on one face, I have had mine fixed on the other.&quot;My second problem is that Scopenhauer proposes that the intellect is a result of the Will and does not exist on its own accord. But in the section &quot;On Philosophy and the Intellect&quot; he says that which inspires the genius is not related to subjective self-interest, and in turn the Will, but to objectivity. But since intellect, in Scopenhauer's view, arose in organisms as a function to serve the Will, how can the intellectual pursuits of the genius evade servicing the Will? The pursuits of the genius might be a result of a surplus of energy from within, causing him to seek knowledge beyond himself and his own self-serving interests, but isn't the very attempt of coping with such a surplus of energy a fulfillment of need and isn't an unquelled need a source of suffering? Need arises from self-interest and therefore from the subjective Will.One final problem is that Scopenhauer's ontological premise is that everything is Will but then he insists that it be renunciated. Wouldn't the desire to renounce the Will be in vain if the Will is the fundamental drive behind all aims, including intellectual ones? So perhaps what Scopenhauer really intends is not the renunciation of the Will but rather the sublimation of it.Scopenhauer lived a very participatory lifestyle so in light of that we should not take his pessimism too seriously. Good read."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"Taken from the nineteenth-century philosopher's last book, Parerga and Paralipomena (1851), Essays &amp; Aphorisms is a superb introduction to Schopenhauer's thought, a sampling of his final views on a wide range of subjects. Admittedly, the author's original two-volume work is often tedious and repetitive, but the selections and abridgements by Hollingdale have produced an easily consulted and highly readable result. As explained in the Introduction, Parerga was actually not a collection of essays or of aphorisms, but, in Schopenhauer's own words, one of &quot;single but systematically ordered thoughts on diverse subjects.&quot; The &quot;Essays&quot; contained in this volume are really chains of such thoughts on specific subjects. Schopenhauer is famous, or rather infamous, primarily for his pessimistic outlook, and only secondarily so for the adaptation to Kant's metaphysics that he constructed to support it. Pessimism is at least as old as literature - Sophocles wrote: &quot;Not to be born at all is the most to be desired; but having seen the light, the next best is to die as soon as possible&quot; - but Schopenhauer's contribution was to try to show that this is justified. The background for this attempt is the system he had worked out and published by 1818 in his principle work, The World as Will and Representation (or Idea), 1200 pages in its final form, and recommended only to the reader who already possesses a healthy interest in Schopenhauer's complete system as the outcome of German metaphysics. Thankfully, Hollingdale outlines this background, and the background necessary to understand it, in an amazingly concise Introduction, which also includes an illuminating biographical sketch. As Hollingdale notes, there is nothing to prevent the reader completely unacquainted with Kant and with Schopenhauer's life and times from picking up Essays &amp; Aphorisms and enjoying it immensely, but it is the reviewer's opinion that the Introduction will prove invaluable to such a reader, and helpful or at least interesting to most others. After the obscure and awkward writing styles of the two giants of German philosophy, Kant and Hegel, Schopenhauer, who revered the former and despised the latter, really comes across as much as an heir to Goethe's legacy as to Kant's. His stylistic strengths, which are both presented and, indirectly, discussed, in the penultimate section &quot;On Books and Writing,&quot; partly accounts for his enduring popularity and the enthusiasm with which at least two of his most famous adherents, Richard Wagner and the young Nietzsche, embraced his philosophy. It is of course, though, the substance of his writing which strikes the reader most in such a condensed book as Essays &amp; Aphorisms. The initiation is brutal. The first two essays &quot;On the Suffering of the World&quot; and &quot;On the Vanity of Existence&quot; leave no doubt as to the overriding sentiment in Schopenhauer's world-view and ethics: &quot;the world is Hell, and men are on one hand the tormented souls and the other the devils in it.&quot; Like his metaphysics, his pessimism threads its way through every section, but not oppressively so. It receives an even-handed treatment and, again like his metaphysics, is not the end of his philosophy but only the context in which one must read the selections, which display, as often as not, a psychological rather than conventionally philosophical insight. A number of his aphorisms &quot;On Psychology&quot; are included, and many of these, as well as others, suggest that he was indeed, as is often claimed, a precursor to Freud, though his direct influence is probably magnified, even distorted, in such a compact selection. As Schopenhauer was an influential figure in Nietzsche's thought, the reader unfamiliar with the reasons for Nietzsche's abandonment of him might expect, seeing the &quot;Dialogue on Religion&quot; and section &quot;On Religion&quot; in the table of contents, religion to be butchered completely, but the material selected, especially if read with Hollingdale's Introduction, is sufficient for the careful reader to realize how the tenets of Augustinian Christianity, with its &quot;sin of existence,&quot; and Buddhism, with its aim of nothingness, are by no means antithetical to his disparagement of life. These systems differ from his primarily in their understanding of the nature rather than the worth of this world. Essays &amp; Aphorisms offers the first-time reader of Schopenhauer a selection of his thought and his thinking, including some of the best and worst of both. From his ludicrous essay &quot;On Women&quot; to his brilliant reflections on genius and intellect, Schopenhauer is present in these pages in all his Romantic splendor and misery, and is to be considered, at the very least, in light of a note about him penned seven years after his death by Nietzsche: &quot;. . . The errors of great men are venerable because they are more fruitful than the truths of little men. . .&quot;"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"arthur schopenhauer is, without a doubt, one of the most important, poetic, talented, brilliant, and also humorously misanthropic thinkers to ever live. his writing is so brilliant that i have trouble understanding that why his greatest admirer friedrich nietzsche is so much more well known and constantly discussed than he is. i would say that they are both on the same par, ingenious equals who are indispensable in terms of philosophical greatness and force of personality. these essays and aphorisms are so vivid and beautifully written that not only is the attentive reader riveted by his thoughts and theories, but even temporarily convinced by his extreme cynicism and pessimism? i am one of those who see schopenhauer's dark view of life and the world as less temperamental and more grounded in reality than many scholars and biographers of the man like to admit. schopenhauer is perhaps, along with nietzsche and other monumental evolutionary thinkers like bergson and stirner, one of the most prophetic and simply gigantic men to ever live. he is, as the back of this particular edition of his aphorisms and essay says, &quot;aware that everything might not be all for best.&quot; no false optimism or transcendentalism here, and no sugary coating on the disturbing truths of man's isolation and confusion in a universe that seems to be purposeless, indifferent, and entirely ephemeral. he rails bitterly against the majority of human beings with the hatred and resentment of one who, as a result of his brilliance and intellectual genius, been ostracized and at times actively abused by the more mediocre and less passionate masses all through his life. schopenhauer's greatest and most vital characteristic is his uncompromising intellectual integrity and his refusal to ignore the very real and in fact almost immobilizing fact of horrendous evil and senseless, unjustified human suffering. his philosophy of renunciation and asceticism, which he in no way actually lived or practiced personally, is the only flaw or inconsistency i can find in his work, and like nietzsche i would say that it is the result of weakness and lack of courage rather than logical thinking or supposed 'objectivity'. also unique is schopenhauer's stubborn belief and recognition that only the present actually exists, and that 'the future' is an illusory projection we create to make up for the inevitable and inescapable dissatisfaction and perpetual disillusion with the here and now. he doesn't offer any fictitious solutions or illusions of salvation which cannot be verified empirically, and he exhorts the individual to stand apart from the crowd of people and realize their potential while understanding that he or she will never attain to what the majority of people pursue frantically, perfect happiness. &quot;in this existence, in which no perfect state exists and satisfaction can only be relative and minimal, we must aim less for the delusion of positive pleasure and more for the securing of our safety and the careful avoidance of suffering or impoverishment.&quot; truer words have never been spoken. it is, as with all legendary artists and thinkers, as if arthur schopenhauer is sitting in your room and talking to you himself--such is the power of his incredibly accurate and poignant commentary on our existence and it's ultimate meaninglessness and emptiness."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"This book grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and forced me to evaluate my priorities in life.

I suppose verboseness is to be expected, after all: most (if not all) of these famed deep thinkers are attempting to condense/define the human experience within the vast ocean of existence itself; given these parameters and the innumerable tangents available, it is no real surprise then that those of philosophic bent tend to express their concepts in complicated and convoluted form. If nothing else, it keeps the proles away in droves (j/k)--but seriously, it also makes reading these conceptions a tedious task; it off-times seems to me that Kant, Hegel et al would have benefited greatly from the presence of a stern editor.But here we have an innovation! Penguin Classics has published an abridged version of Arthur Schopenhauer's _Parerga and Paralipomena_ into this nice digestible volume, _Essays and Aphorisms_. R.J. Hollingdale's translation is a clear, lucid read, and with the repetition and grandiloquence removed, the pessimistic outlook of Herr Schopenhauer gains a keen sharpness; his controversial musings cut quick and to the bone.As for the material itself...well, let's take a look:\\"The social structure, the state, will stand quite firm only when it is founded on an universally recognized metaphysical system. Such a system can naturally be only one of folk-metaphysics, that is, religion: ...the social structure could hardly exist at all if religion did not lend weight to the government's authority and the ruler's dignity...\\" (On Religion: A Dialogue, pg. 109)\\"...as the weaker sex, [women] are driven to rely not on force but on cunning: hence their instinctive subtlety and their ineradicable tendency to tell lies: for, as nature has equipped the lion with claws and teeth, the elephant with tusks, the wild boar with fangs (etc), so it has equipped women with the power of dissimulation as her means of attack and defense...\\" (On Women, pg. 83)\\"A constitution embodying nothing but abstract justice would be a wonderful thing, but it would not be suited to beings such as men. Because the great majority of men are in the highest degree egoistic, unjust, inconsiderate, deceitful, sometimes even malicious, and equipped moreover with very mediocre intelligence, there exists a need for a completely unaccountable power...\\" (On Law and Politics, pg. 152-153)\\"States of human happiness and good fortune can as a rule be compared with certain groups of trees: seen from a distance they look beautiful, but if you go up to and into them their beauty disappears and you can no longer discover it. That is why we so often feel envy for other people.\\" (On Psychology, pg.171)\\"Few write as an architect builds, drawing up a plan beforehand and thinking it out down to the smallest details. Most write as they play dominoes: their sentences are linked together as dominoes are, one by one, in part deliberate, in part by chance.\\" (On Writing, pg. 207)This is great stuff, people, whether you agree with Schopenhauer's statements or not. Brilliant & provocative, and an enjoyable read as well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"R.J.Hollingdale was judicious in his choice of material for this text which makes a good 'primer' for reading Schopenhauerat length. Hollingdale's introduction provides a useful profile on the German philosopher and his background. As other reviewers have remarked, Schopenhauer presented his ideas very clearly and such is the clarity of his thought, you get the feeling that he is addressing you personally. Considering that he is touching on the mysteries of life as a kind of theatre-cum-battle-ground, in which the will struggles to act out its purposes, accompanied by a kind of continuous ground bass of suffering, you might expect Schopenhauer to be heavy going. But his essays are frequently peppered with wit and lively turns of phrase.Notorious for his contempt of Hegel, the preacher of philosophical optimism, for whom God mutates into the State and thereafter bestows order and felicity with the precision of a Swiss clock(Schopenhauer said that in Hegel's philosophy, the 'turkeys fly around ready roasted'!)- Schopenhauer railed against such bloodless abstractions. This false optimism prevailed well into the late 19th c and even the early 20th c, promising that science and social engineering - the cult of 'progress' - would eventually remove most of life's ills.For his own part, Schopenhauer saw that all such ventures were likely to remain impotent in the face of human suffering, in his eyes, the most immediate fact of life. For Schopenhauer, the will-to-live and the struggle for existence were synonymous with suffering, and however you dressed it up, it remained the ground bass to life. For the prophets of 'progress' perhaps, that sounded like cowardice, cosmic stage fright. But after all, Buddhism has taught the truth of suffering for 2,500 years. It is well known that Schopenhauer availed himself of Buddhist and Hindu teachings and therefore, the interface between them is worth exploring. In other respects, Schopenhauer remained very much a European, drawing on classical sources and, of course, Kant's philosophy.Schopenhauer's views on the arts were interesting, seeing all true art as a blessed space in which the struggle of subjective 'willing' might be silenced, leaving us free to see the world as idea or pure 'objectivity.' Schopenhauer was a keen student of human psychology and the peculiar forces shaping human character. His stress on the primacy of the will, and the fact that he regarded the intellect as secondary to it, anticipated much found in Freud and Jung. Hence, these essays and aphorisms make engaging reading."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"This is a brief compendium and collection of Schopenhauer's expository writing, suitable for a quick introduction to many of his ideas and most famous sayings. Few philosophers were as clear and concise in their writing as he was, and this little book contains many of most quotable and trenchant passages. The Schopenhauer neophyte as well as the more experienced reader will find much to reflect on and to entertain here.Personally, I like Schopenhauer despite his overall downer message, although his philosophy and metaphysics, which is which is called absolute voluntaristic idealism, hasn't faired that well in the last 100 years, although when I was in college 30 years ago he seemed to be popular among the students I knew who were studying philosophy.There are several reasons why Schopenhauer's thought is still important. An idealist like Kant, he kept Kant's distinction between the noumenal and the phenomenal, between the mental and external representations of reality. Kant's defense of idealism, that some ideas or at least mental processes are innate, is still relevant in modern brain science and neurobiology and in Chomsky's theories in linguistics, especially in regard to Chomsky's ideas about language learning and acquisition, in which there is support from brain science for a built-in facility in humans for language, and possibly an innate syntactical generator component to language ability.Although innate ideas probably don't exist in the way that Kant envisioned them, modern brain science has supported his theory that the mind or brain is actively involved in the organizing and structuring of the data from the senses, and that we couldn't make sense of reality if we didn't have inborn aptitudes and capabilities to do that.Schopenhauer emphasized the importance of Eastern philosophy and the validity of its introspective methods, while maintaining his overall empirical approach. His moral and ethical philosophy is based on compassion rather than on practical and reasonable considerations like Kant's. He was probably the first important western philosopher to give credit to Zen and Buddhist thought, while remaining faithful to the empirical principles of science.Outside of philosophy his thoughts have had a major impact on psychology and the arts. He was the most important influence on both Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, and he also had a great influence on Freud and Jung, and on writers and composers from Wagner to Tolstoy. During the 20th century, Schopenhauer's reputation faded and the importance of his work has been to a great extent overlooked, but recent books show that his importance is being rediscovered and reappraised.I have to include this brief passage on his thought, since it's excellent, which I obtained from the biographies section of Bluepete website.\\"Schopenhauer's system of philosophy, as previously mentioned, was based on that of Kant's. Schopenhauer did not believe that people had individual wills but were rather simply part of a vast and single will that pervades the universe: that the feeling of separateness that each of has is but an illusion. So far this sounds much like the Spinozistic view or the Naturalistic School of philosophy. The problem with Schopenhauer, and certainly unlike Spinoza, is that, in his view, \\"the cosmic will is wicked ... and the source of all endless suffering.\\"I have a personal anecdote to recount. My college roommates and I used to read Schopenhauer at night to each other over a couple of beers, and we found his acerbic, trenchant style and sharp wit a delight to read, and this book is perhaps the best example of his prose in that regard. One Schopenhauer quote I still remember after 30 years is: \\"Intellect comes from the mother; character from the father,\\" which might say a lot about his family life and how he grew up.Schopenhauer is also famous for quotes such as:\\"The two foes of human happiness are pain and boredom.\\"(from his Essays, Personality; or What a Man Is).\\"I have long held the opinion that the amount of noise that anyone can bear undisturbed stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity and therefore be regarded as pretty fair measure of it.\\"\\"To marry is to halve your rights and double your duties.\\"I have to include my favorite quote on marriage here, although it isn't Schopenhauer's, and I don't know where it came from, although it echoes his sentiments: \\"Marriage is the institution where the woman loses her the name and the man his solvency.\\"His dyspeptic view of life might have been fostered by his delicate digestive system. He would spent many minutes poring over the menu before ordering his food in the cafes where he usually dined, because a wrong choice \\"could send his nerves ringing for days,\\" according to one comment I read about him. Whatever the source of his pessimism, Schopenhauer seemed almost embarrassed and ashamed to be in a human body, because he did not seem to find much good in humans or human society. No doubt he would have preferred to be a higher, more intelligent species than humans, if such exists somewhere else in the universe. But Schopenauer didn't seem to think that intelligent life existed here. :-)Whatever the current fate of his reputation, Schopenhauer was a uniquely gloomy intellect who contributed much to several areas of philosophy. And not the least of his virtues is that he was a true cynic and pessimist--surely the most accurate view of life, after all. :-)"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"Schopenhauer's father committed suicide. Son Arthur had been very devoted to his father Heinrich Floris. The high-sensitive son could not deal with the fact, that his mother Johanna had preferred to talk with Goethe in her Weimar Literary Salon instead of helping her husband, getting more and more depressed as a salesman in Hamburg. A typical, later on dialogue between mother (at that time a famous novelist) and son, fresh university lecturer: \\"One still will read my writings, at a time, when your books are out of stock and only one copy can be found in a lumber-room.\\" Mother thereupon sneering: \\"The whole, complete edition of your writings, my son, still will be waiting to get an order to be shipped...\\" (the reviewer fears that his own frizztext-book might have to suffer the same fate). \\"The World as Will\\", as too much inconsiderate will-to-live - in such a way Schopenhauer (February 22, 1788 - September 21, 1860) experienced the whole human being. With persistance and arrogance, with brain and bile, suffering and bitterly, but with sensitivity and empathy as well he wrote - trying not to get overwhelmed by disgust. He had a deep neurotic aversion against women (surely involved by his mother). Once he pushed in anger his charwoman down the stairs backwards. But this female individual offered resistance very intellectually: She successful called a judge and Schopenhauer was sentenced, to pay a pension to her - all her life long. But exactly this evil bile encouraged him, on the other hand, to fight against mother Johanna and Goethe, against Hegel and diverse money-lenders. However just opposite to his choleric, hot-tempered way of life, his philosophical theory proclaimed to be calm as a Buddha. He adored Eastern Vedic (Buddhist) Scriptures. He adored enjoying art as a way out of the more mediocre and less passionate masses. The summary of his philosophy finally is the reference to the noblesse to demand nothing; this German philosopher's hope is, that \\"willing\\" might be silenced. 150 years and some wars later we all should agree. \\"To be vulgar is nothing else than giving the leading role in our consciousness to the will and not to the cognition.\\" This tiny book is still able to help today's readers to climb not a meditative, but a thoughtful level.

It's the kind of book you regret is over once you're finished. It's a very accessible way to discover Schopenhauer, warts and all, without having to get bogged down in some of his more laborious, convoluted pieces. Scopenhauer is one of the world's great philosophers, but is probably under read due to the complexity and pedantic nature of his more extensive works. This casual collection of essays allows the reader to get to know a little about Schopenauer and his philosophy.Are humans immortal in any way? Well, yes. Schopenauer, who unlike many of his western European counterparts, studied eastern as well as western philosophy, and it shows in the essay \\"On the Indestructability of our Essential Being by Death.\\" As Eastern philosophers have suggested for some time, matter is conserved rather than 'created or destroyed,' so of course we live on in terms of our physical selves, since our 'physical selves' is what we essentially are. Mentally however, once the atoms of our brains etc. dissolve, we are no more, and as Schopenhauer puts it, such a \\"question whether we exist [mentally] after death [has no] meaning,\\" like the idea that negative length has no meaning. In a line that couldn't have been said better by any modern, Schopenauer says that indeed \\"consciousness is extinguished by death...But cheer up! [Schopenhauer a pessimist?]...this consciousness is, in its origin and aim, merely an expedient for helping the animal to get what it needs. The state to which death restores us, on the other hand, is our original state, i.e. is the being's intrinsic state.\\" hmmmmm! I wonder if Freud attributed his own 'death wish' hypothesis to Schopenhauer. If he didn't, he should have. So here we have, no, death doesn't really happen physically, but to the extent it does mentally, its more of a return to an original state, and now worth worrying too much over in the long run.Although the lion's share of Schopenhauer's philosophy is dedicated to demosntrating the necessary idealism of the human mind, he was a materialist of the most pragmatic sort, as evidenced in lines from \\"On Various Subjects,\\" where he speaks of the \\"false antithesis between mind and matter....[declaring that] all ostensible mind can be attributed to matter...[that mental] life is only a semblance, an illusion, and every creature is in reality a mere automaton, i.e. a play of mechanical, physical and chemical forces.\\" Of course we, and other animals, are not just agglomerations of chemicals as are rocks, for we also have a 'will' that directs our life actions. This is for Schopenhauer and emergent property of the physical parts of our bodies and not, as Bergson suggested, some distinct, mysterious substance.On one more nonpessimistic note, Schopenhauer comments on Hesiod's interpretation of the myth of Pandora's box, saying \\"it is not all the evil but all the good things of the world which Pandora had in her box (as her name already indicates). When Epimetheus rashly opened it the good things flew out and away: Hope alone was saved and still remains with us.\\" Schopenhauer a pessimist? If you can get past Schopenhauer's misogyny, this is a neat little book of wisdom for the philosophically minded and nonphilosopher alike."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"oustanding. I am speechless. This is a fine author that ought to be read almost everyday of our lives.I am glad I've had the chance to read Schopenhauer. Don't waste your life. Read it today.

The \\"Essays\\" state all of his major ideas but in an enjoyable way. Of course his magnum opus explicates his philosophy more exhaustively, but I got bogged down by Schopenhauer's incessant treatment and reinterpretation of Kantian transcendentalism.What I find fascinating is Schopenhauer's pessimistic view of consciousness and existence, his western philosophical reworking of Vedantic and Buddhistic philosophy. He was able to synthesize Kantian and Eastern idealism and make the combination all his own.One delights (even if one does not agree) in Schopenhauer's acerbic abuses slung at life and all of its tedious cycles, Christian metaphysics (not so much Christianity itself), and optimisms of every kind. He has a way of reducing the ideals we cherish and take for granted to the absurd mechanisms of control and torture that (according to him) they really are.In the end, Schopenhauer is quite guilty of turning all the world into one ridiculous straw man. But he is so deft and devilishly humorous in the process that we are almost convinced. It took Nietzsche quite some time to realize that this was no true pessimist at all, but one who delighted in life via berating it!Read the \\"Essays\\" if you want to be challenged, if you want to understand better the philosophers he influenced (e.g. Nietzsche), and if you want to appreciate a one of a kind artistic presentation of some fascinating philosophical assertions."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"In this book one finds Schopenhauer simultaneously at his unique &amp; refreshing best.Unique in his astounding philosophies,which may leave the reader amazed,humored,&amp; at times baffled by his thoughts.Refreshed in the keen eye of this convincing observer,whose musings in life &amp; thought are reinvigorating almost to the point &amp; at times reaching the point of near inspiration.A fine book to get introducted to on this stimulating &amp; unforgettable man."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"A recapitulation of Schopenhauer's key ideas, such as the vanity of earthly existence and the suffering in the world, along with some engrossing sections on suicide, religion and psychology.

This guy is big. I mean big.But analytic philosophy, which dominates much of today's philosophical inquiry, research and discourse, tends to overlook much of the German philosophers (except a handful like Frege) unfortunately for reasons that would take me far more time than you possibly would have time for (after all, you're here just for a book review!).Now, this work (or rather a compilation of many separate writings) was quite frankly one of most illuminating and thought-provoking reading experiences I have ever encountered in a long time. You will feel a full spectrum of emotions from possible disgust (his frankly misogynistic piece, \\"On Women\\") juxtaposed to sheer wonder at the spellbinding elucidation of what \\"thinking for oneself\\" truly means.However, as it goes with most philosophical works, I encourage the prospective reader to view his writings with care and consideration at the historical and cultural context of its time and to place the words at an academic distance (but not too far) and not as a self-help book. In the end, you, as an independent thinker decides what is the right thing for you to adhere to and consider.Schopenhauer like Kant is famous for his concise compositions. But Schopenhauer on the other hand also understood the letter as not simply a tool of articulation but as an art form. I found that his words turned the pages far more than other German philosophers (Kant, Nietzsche, and especially Hegel, whom Schopenhauer disliked) I have encountered. The overall reading experience was surprisingly short (took me a couple of days) yet each and every subject matter he seems to skim into can run quite deep (I highly recommend reading \\"On Aesthetics\\" at least twice). Such is the genius of Schopenhauer, whom I consider to be the Hemingway of philosophy.So in short, whether you are a layperson or working on your philosophical dissertation, in need of a short and sweet introduction to Schopenhauer (unlike the more comprehensive The World as Will and Representation) and his views and ideas while having a bit more knowledge than a quick glance through his wiki (if read carefully) -- look no further!"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"If you're serious about finding out what life is all about, or if you're just looking to expand your cleverness by kicking idiocy off her rusty stool, then read The World as Will and Representation. Arthur Schopenhauer was only 24 years old when he wrote his masterpiece, and Albert Einstein read it often and Erwin Schrodinger, the father of quantum physics, read every word of Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer was well ahead of his time when he wrote that force and substance are the same thing, that is, all objects are space-time. He wrote this about 80 years before the space-time revolution made Albert Einstein famous. Schopenhauer also argued that the unconscious is the primary mover of history; and so all thinkers until his insight have been in the dark to their true motives. He wrote this decades in advance of Sigmund Freud. They don't say these things today, because it seems that Schopenhauer has fallen out of history, only to be replaced by celebrity rubbish. Instead, modern 'pop' books are marketed to American teenagers and this is why the level of intelligence is plummeting like a pebble in a pond. You won't find this problem with the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer; oh know. From what I have gathered, Schopenhauer was the consciousness expanding agent of his day.It would be a stretch of faith to expect the World as Will and Representation to be as potent today, as it was back in its day; because when you read how much this book permanently imprinted great minds like Richard Wagner, Nietzsche and Leo Tolstoy, to name just a few brother genius' of the 19th century'; you realize that we must be in different mental worlds from the people living in the 19th century; however, from the annals of the past, we can gather the obvious fact that we are dealing with a real thinker, rather than a career academic, and even though Schopenhauer has been superseded by the 20th century, I reckon he can still give you an insight or two, into what Aldous Huxley called, 'the telescopic eons of eternity', and his prose is second to none in. Indeed, Nietzsche's writting style is influenced by Schopenhauers.In its heyday, this book gave many an ontology peeling experience and sent shivers through the hollow chasm they called polite society; and today, Schopenhauer can still put you back in the cockpit of your life vehicle, like an anti X Factor tonic, you will realize that stressing over little things is silly, when confronted with the eternity ahead. Why not? The Buddha tough that we are in a state of sleep and so it is pertinent of all sentient beings to dissolve the sleeping ego, so as to glimpse the eternity that poets and seers walk about. Many creative people, today, argue that drugs are the only method of cleansing the mind from the flabby troths of consumerism, so as to glimpse these eons; verily this may be so, however, you first need to erect some intellectual foundations, before attempting your building project. So it is still worth reading some originality makers, people like Shakespeare, Einstein, (insert your favourite genius) and Schopenhauer can supply you with the intellectual mortar for your life journey.You don't need drugs to expand your seeing you see; you can awaken by reading the right philosophy. Back in the 1940's, scientists discovered consciousness expanding chemicals; a spiritual antidote to the atom bomb if you like. These chemicals allowed the testosterone driven monkey mind a glimpse through the veil of Maya. Taking LSD was like watching a high definition, 3D, film for the first time. Your sensory ratios were enhanced for the better, but inevitably, the real world would forever appear dull and dreary. It was thought that by expanding your awareness you stopped being a selfish arshole. It didn't work by the way.Reading great philosophy can also do this. The genius of reading what genius' have said is that your mind expands like a balloon, and you see further; you realise that the rat race is an insult to your time and those mortgage payments they promised will make you happy are not the meaning of life after all, and so you stop being an envious i-bot, because you see something more outside the dreary shopping trolly.Carl Sagan said there are millions of books; the point is, read the right ones. Reading can change your neuronal ratios, making you smarter, but, inevitably, your world will probably look duller.Philosophers today don't talk like this, but you won't find this problem with the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and this is why the philosophy of the old pessimist is a consciousness expanding agent, though I doubt he will have the same effect as he once did, but this is only because our world is so saturated with noise, that even God is drowned out. Schopenhauer is now silent when he should be read by free thinking spirits; after all, Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger were fans.Arthur Schopenhauer is a historical anomaly who wrote about space-time 80 years before the physicists and discovered the unconscious 60 years before Freud. So he is a historical anomaly but you can probably still get a week consciousness expanding hit from reading The World as Will and Representation and have a corner of the great veil lifted. Also, I will add, grab your consciousness by the short n curly and move your ontological moorings slightly to the left, just like a tectonic plate sliding on acid.I used the word \`pessimist' above because this is the smelly label that dangles over Schopenhauer's system. If you go to Wikipedia or the Stanford encyclopaedia, you will come away with the wrong idea about the man's ideas. Reading what someone else has written about the philosophy of Schopenhauer is like wanting someone else to digest your food for you. I mean, would you read history books if you had a DeLorean? Then why do we insist on reading second hand writings, and second hand scribbling about great literature at that, because that is what Schopenhauer is; literature comparable to a grand symphony. Isn't this obvious, that reading secondary texts is analogous to having some bloke whistle Beethoven in your ere, when you can listen to the real thing instead?LSD inventor, Albert Hoffman, was a young man in Vienna when Schopenhauer's fame was most felt. Years later, aged 103, Hoffman was asked if he had gained any insight to what happens after death, he said \\"I go back to where I came from, to where I was before I was born, that's all.\\" This is from Schopenhauer."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"I came to Schopenhauer's work reluctantly, having been put off by two things: first, his well-known belligerent attitude towards women (misogyny is an understatement); and second by Nietzsche, who - despite an early infatuation with Schopenhauer - later turned against his \\"mentor\\" (of sorts), claiming his work lacked any ethical applicability.Yet, as an avid reader of philosophy in general, I found myself repeatedly drawn towards Schopenhauer through various resources. After putting my prejudices aside, then, I have to say that I consumed this volume with great enthusiasm and found Schopenhauer to be one of the clearest, most articulate philosophers in the Western tradition. He was, in a word, a genius.Sure, the \\"Buddha of Frankfurt\\" (his nickname) was not saint, but Schopenhauer himself would have been the first to admit it. That said, I think the chapter on women and Nietzsche's complaints should be kept in mind, but not used to disallow the rest of his brilliant methaphysical writing.I want to mention here, too, that the introduction by R.J. Hollingdale is outstanding and helpful. I have read Kant, but I still found his summary of philosophy leading up to Schopenhauer to be a refreshing and lively review (compared, say, with the dull, unhelpful introduction by Dave Berman in Everyman's edition of The World as Will and Idea). It is hard to sum up Kant's thought in a few pages, but Hollingdale does a great job, I think.Finally, I don't think you need to have read Kant to understand most of the ideas presented in this text. Also, I have to concur with Schopenhauer's university philosophy professor, G.E. Schulze, who told the young thinker to stick with ONLY Plato and Kant - but to that small list I would now add the name Schopenhauer.I highly recommend this text for both beginners and experts in the field -it is THAT good...and it just might change your whole perspective, if not your way of life. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"The two people I found most interesting in Durant's Story of Philosophy were Schopenhauer and Spinoza. Reading Spinoza kind of scares me so I decided to read Schopenhauer first. I don't really know very much about philosophy and don't know the correct way to approach these texts. For the most part I don't see the world the same way as him, he's far too negative, but I do find his writing interesting. He's also extremely sexist or perhaps just plain anti female, I'd sometimes show his anti women remarks to my girlfriend while grinning just to get a rise out of her. As for the book itself, Hollingdale seems to have done a good translation, or at least it seemed very readable. The biggest negatives are there are very few textual notes and sometimes the non German text wasn't translated."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"Who was the first to understand that newer, better ideas are always rejected and even violently resisted, before being finally accepted? Was It Schopenhauer? Was it Tom Paine, Louis Agassiz, George Bernard Shaw, Max Planck, or Gandi? Or perhaps the idea is as old as the ancient legend of Prometheus who \\"stole the fire of the gods,\\" and in the process taught primitive humans all of the arts of civilization; for which he was punished by being bound to a rock eternally by Zeus so that an eagle could eat out his liver.In modern times at least, the answer seems to be Arthur Schopenhauer, (1788 - 1860), who early published what may be the first clear formulation of the idea. Following are some memorable quotes from Essays and Aphorisms, which give an idea as to what is meant.\\"The discovery of truth is prevented more effectively not by the false appearance of things present and which mislead into error, not directly by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by preconceived opinion, by prejudice. (Essays and Aphorisms, 120 9)\\"Truth that has been merely learned is like an artificial limb, a false tooth, a waxen nose; at best, 'like a nose made out of another's flesh; it adheres to 'us only because it is put on. But truth acquired by thinking of our own is like a natural limb; it alone 'really belongs to us. This is the fundamental difference 'between the thinker and the mere scholar. (Essays and Aphorisms, 91 4)\\"Truth is fairest naked, and the simpler its expression the profounder its influence. (Essays and Aphorisms, 205 8)\\"How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do so. If they should ever feel any metaphysical need, it is taken care of from above and in advance by the various religions; and these, whatever they may be like, suffice. (Essays and Aphorisms, 123 16)\\"Great minds are related to the brief span of time during which they live as great buildings are to a little square in which they stand: you cannot see them in all their magnitude because you are standing too close to them. (Essays and Aphorisms, 226 5-D)\\"The difference between the genius and the normal intelligence is, to be sure, only a quantitative one, insofar as it is only a difference of degree: one is nevertheless tempted to regard it as a qualitative one when one considers how normal men, despite their individual diversity, all think along certain common lines, so that they are frequently in unanimous agreement over judgments which are, in fact, false. (Essays and Aphorisms, 131 23)\\"To estimate a genius you should not take the mistakes in his productions, or his weaker works, but only those works in which he excels. For even in the realm of the intellect, weakness and absurdity cleave so firmly to human nature that even the most brilliant mind is not always entirely free of them: whence the mighty errors which can be pointed to even in the works of the greatest men. (Essays and Aphorisms, 223 5-A)\\"The great misfortune for intellectual merit is that it has to wait until the good is praised by those who produce only the bad.\\"It is the fate of the great here on earth to be recognized by us only when they are no more.\\"After a hundred years Copernicus had not yet supplanted Ptolemy. Bacon, Descartes, Locke prevailed very slowly and very late. It was no different with Newton. Although Newton lived almost forty years after the appearance of his Principia, his theory was, when he died, recognized only in England, and there only partially, while abroad he could, according to Voltaire, count fewer than twenty adherents. Hume, although he wrote in a thoroughly popular style, was disregarded until his fiftieth year. Kant, although he wrote and taught his whole life long, became famous only after his sixtieth year. Artists and poets have a better chance than thinkers because their public is at least a hundred times bigger: and yet what did Mozart and Beethoven count for during their lifetimes? or Dante, or even Shakespeare? Every Portuguese is proud of Camoens, the only Portuguese poet: but he lived on alms procured for him in the streets. (Essays and Aphorisms, 224 5-B)\\"As the sun needs an eye in order to shine, and music an ear in order to sound, so the worth of every masterpiece in art and science is conditioned by the mind related and equal to it to which it speaks. Only such a mind posses the incantation to arouse the spirits imprisoned in such a work and make them show themselves. The commonplace head stands before it as before a magic casket he cannot open or an instrument he cannot play. A beautiful work requires a sensitive mind, a speculative work a thinking mind, in order to really exist and live. (Essays and Aphorisms, 225 5-C)\\"The poet [and novelist] presents the imagination with images from life and human characters and situations, sets them all in motion and leaves it to the beholder to let these images take his thoughts as far as his mental powers will permit. This is why he is able to engage men of the most differing capabilities, indeed fools and sages together. The philosopher [and scientist], on the other hand, presents not life itself but the finished thoughts which he has abstracted from it and then demands that the reader should think precisely as, and precisely as far as, he himself thinks. That is why his public is so small. (Essays and Aphorisms, 118 4, brackets added)\\"If you want to earn the gratitude of your own age you must keep in step with it. But if you do that you will produce nothing great. If you have something great in view you must address yourself to posterity. (Essays and Aphorisms, 131 25)\\"Talent works for money and fame; the motive which moves genius to productivity is, on the other hand, less easy to determine. It isn't money, for genius seldom gets any. It isn't fame: fame is too uncertain and, more closely considered, of too little worth. Nor is it strictly for its own pleasure, for the great exertion involved almost outweighs the pleasure. It is rather an instinct of a unique sort by virtue of which the individual possessed of genius is impelled to express what he has seen and felt in enduring works without being conscious of any further motivation. (Essays and Aphorisms, 131 26)Schopenhauer said that the creative genius must write for posterity and expect to be rejected in one's own lifetime. That is a pessimistic attitude; or a self-deluded one if one's theory is wrong. But it may also be practical. Until a new theory is finally accepted, it can not be considered \\"true\\" objectively. And \\"accepted\\" must mean by a large enough scientific, philosophic, or academic community to make use of the idea, and to give it reality by passing it along to the general public. In the long run it must be accepted by society at large, or at least by a much larger group, or it will forever remain a cult phenomenon.What it all comes down to is that the creative genius must have a sufficient degree of confidence in the truth of an idea, that one is willing to put one's life on the line. Possibly not in a sudden, life-or-death gamble, though that too sometimes happens; but--what can be more difficult--in a slow ebbing of the life-force that occurs when one risks everything on an idea that for the present is rejected by almost everyone; and gambles it on an unknown future where it will probably fail, or worse; where it may never see the light of day. But it also might be a future in which the new idea succeeds, thereby ushering in a future that will be better than the present, perhaps immeasurably so."},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","review":"A. Schopenhauer and Ralph W. Emerson deserve to be read together. I remember reading these two at roughly the same time and they blew my mind open, splattering it on whatever was behind me. Schopenhauer writes beautifully, with great wit, humor and massive quantities of vitrol all at once. R. J. Hollingdale, famous for his superlative translations of Friedrich Nietzsche's writings, does justice to this collection; it's only a shame that he never translated the rest of his writings, or at least the World as Will and Representation.A brief passage for those who might be otherwise daunted:\\"Dilettantes! Dilettantes! -- this is the derogatory cry those who apply themselves to art or science for the sake of gain raise against those who pursue it for love of it and pleasure in it. THis derogation rests on their vulgar conviction that no one would take up a thing seriously unless prompted to it by want, hunger, or some other kind of greediness. The public has the same outlook and consequently holds the same opinion, which is the origin of its universal respect for 'the professional' and its mistrust of the dilettante. the truth, however, is that to the dilettante the thing is the end, while to the professional as such it is the means; and only he who is directly interested in a thing, and occupies himself with it form love of it, will pursue it with entire seriousness. It is from such as these, and not from wage earners, that the greatest things have always come.\\" pg. 227My copy is showing age and serious wear; I'd recommend picking up two, you'll be reading this into the dust.If you enjoy the 'gallant' misogeny and self-sure egoism in passages like those from his essay \\"On Women\\" I'd reccomend Max Stirner's \\"Ego and its Own\\"--a must for rampant individualists.

It therefore seems that the extraordinary zeal in opposing it displayed by the clergy of monotheistic religions- a zeal which is not supported by the Bible or by any cogent reasons- must have some hidden reasons behind it: may this not be that the voluntary surrender of life is an ill compliment to him who said that all things were very good? If so, it is another instance of the obligatory optimism of these religions, which denounces self-destruction so as not to be denounced by it.&quot;Of course in order to fully appreciate that quote you'd have to read the whole essay, but I think it's a good sample.

Many think this book is an attack on Bruce Wilkerson's THE PRAYER OF JABEZ but in reality, Hanegraaff praises Wilkerson for helping people learn to pray in his forward. While he is critical in some places of some points that Wilkerson made, he does so in love and not in a harsh tone.This book is a short work on prayer. There are other books that offer more biblical exegesis on prayer passages (see THE SPIRIT HELPS US PRAY) yet this is more of a devotional work on prayer. Hanegraaff takes the Lord's prayer (Matthew 6:5-13) and devotes chapters to each part of the Lord's prayer. He uses personal illustrations to teach his reader his points.The only drawback I found to this book is that it is hard for me to seperate Hanegraaff from his normal office, apologetics. His books on apologetics are much better than this book on prayer. While I don't know Hanegraaff personally, I don't think of him as a \\"man of prayer.\\" Not that he doesn't pray I simply mean I see him defending our faith while I see Jim Cymbala on his face before God in prayer. Thankfully, God wants every Christian to pray and so I enjoyed Hanegraaff's work on prayer and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"The Prayer of Jesus was the most awesome book. We can take a look at most awesome leader's prayer lives in the bible, but we can not compare them to God hiself, Jesus Christ's prayer life. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching how to become more intimate with Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"I wish this book hadn't been married to the Jabez fad, as that dooms it to fade away with the Jabez books, while Hanagraaf's book deserve to stick around for years and be re-printed.But one question: the author makes much of the disciples' request \\"teach us NOW to pray\\" (as contrasted with the request of \\"teach us HOW to pray.\\") Um, what translation of Luke 11 (or else what text in any translation) has that NOW in there? I also looked at the Greek for both the textus receptus and the older manuscripts and don't find any hint of this. SO WHERE DID IT COME FROM? Please private message me if you can shed some light on this."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"While I think this was a really nice read, breaking down the Lord's Prayer line by line, I was a little put out by the publisher or author playing on the success of another book (Jabez) to push this one. If it weren't for using Bruce Wilkinson's \\"Jabez\\" to promote \\"Prayer of Jesus\\", and then, what appeared to me, to slightly belittle \\"Jabez\\" within this book, I might have given it a 5, and almost debated giving it a 3.Over all, it reads like a step-by-step instruction manual for a Christian to understand the prayer, which i thought was cool. It was refreshing to review the Lord's Prayer line by line and would be a good study for people who haven't recited the Lord's Prayer their whole life, as well as a new outlook for those who have recited this prayer for many years. Everyone needs to recite this prayer daily and this book, in a sense, explains why. I believe people will enjoy this book, so I am hoping my \\"Jabez\\" opinion doesn't affect your choice to buy it, but I had to be honest in my review."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"I have had real concern about Prayer of Jabez type, fast food, self-centered prayer.

Right when I think everyone has been sucked into the next fad, someone like Hank breaks through.He shows in this book that there are no short cuts to being blessed. He points out that there are no short cuts period. If you think the prayer of Jabez was great, try this book out. Its definitely a great book to follow up with. So many protestants slam Catholics for mantras and repetitive prayers, then jump on board when a new bestseller comes out. This book simply brings us back to earth."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Illustrates and rewords the lord's (or \\"our father\\") prayer.

It is a good start for a life-long journey."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"I felt like I was reading a critical review of &quot;The Prayer of Jabez.&quot; I think that if he could have left out the5-10 negative references to a fellow brother in Christ (Bruce Wilkinson) that I could have maybe made it further than 1/3 the way through it. Maybe he didn't mean for it to sound the way it does, but if not he could and should have left all references to &quot;JABEZ&quot; out of it all. I for one didn't read Wilkinson's book and was looking for a good read and devotional in this. I didn't find it, though. Maybe I'll just have to read this closer without paying attention to the bad reviews to Bruce Wilkinson."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"This book 'Prayer of Jesus' interjects the faith through Jesus Christ our Lord. Many people are not making the right connection to pray to the Father in the Heavenlies. The word of God (The Holy Scriptures) reeferences: 'NO ONE!!!! comes to the Father (GOD) but by JESUS CHRIST (*check refs) -- as to this powerful verse. Hank H, the author is a brilliant writer inspired by the HS - he writes his 'thesis' on 'The Prayer of Jesus' --The reason many tragedies are happening, is because many are praying to other 'gods' like: St. Mary, St. Jude, St. Barthalomew, St. Theresa, and many more saints, who are 'DEAD' -- BURRIED. aLSO MANY ARE PRAYING TO other false 'gods' like 'ALLA'- the god of 'Kaball' - and -- THEIR OWN BRAINS, Maharishi, Islams gods, the god of the law of Moses, and other false fascinations of imaginations.If many were praying or at least one person was praying to Jesus Christ in the Heavenlies, at the WTC tragif bombing, in the 9/'11 NYC tragif - massacre, and Washg DC, bombing, then this tragig bombing from the hell forces would not have occured. We have to pray to Jesus Christ only, to iinterceed for others in this world of confusion and death-problematic world. This book tells us 'Pray without ceasing' In the name of 'The Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost. Many others at the WTC , were praying to their 'Stock-brokers' fiinancial securities' -- (The god of Gold' inscribed in the OT 'The Golden Calf' (check bible refs)We thank Hank H. the author for being the intercessore by the Holy Spirit to pray to the Father by Jesus Christ. --Also the worshiping of saints is a 'SIN' 'You shall have no other 'gods' besides the real GOD!! (OT) references) by Jesus Christ (NT) ordinance.Read and buy this book to ascertain yourself of the real prayer the Jesus Prayer' -- is our Prayer.End****************"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Hank has done the Christian world and all those who would consider Christianity a monumental favor with this book aboutPrayer and praying Jesus' way.He points out that prayer is not trying to get God to change His mind or will, but to change US to conform to His already perfect will and purpose for the Kingdom and our role in it.The LORD's Prayer is simply the cornerstone to effective prayer in the life of the believer, not a rote formula or recitation to get God to automatically respond. It is a model, a framework of what proper, God pleasing prayer is all about.Prayer is not merely about us and our needs of the moment; it is about HIM and HIS WILL. Hank makes the point that the Lord's Prayer starts and ends with God in Heaven, His Kingdom and Gloryand that the purpose of all Christ-honoring prayer is to maximize the glory of the Lord by what we pray, how we pray, the faith/hope we bring to prayer, our expectancy, and how serious we take the two critical factors that end every biblical prayer:&quot;In Jesus' Name&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;.Prayer is RELATIONSHIP, not just realization of our needs/wants.&quot;Our Father&quot; sets the tone for what true prayer is all about.Hank does a great job in showing that our walk with Christ determines Who our true Father is and how the mutual love relationship plays itself out in the Family of God. It's not what we can get out of God that counts, but what He can get into us of His Spirit and being filled with His love and presence.It's 'Presence' over 'Presents'.Finally, this book is a great corrective to many misunderstoodbeliefs about Prayer of Jabez, for example, which many folks try to use as a formula for blessing rather than a template of a godly life lived in proper relationship with the One we pray to.While God is more eager to bless/grant prayers than we are inclined to ask, we still need to ask aright,putting first things first: Our Father must come first and His will prevail.Why would we want to receive any less than God's best for us?This book will literally revolutionize your prayer life. When we prayerfully draw closer to Abba Father, becoming more Christ-likein the process of a life of prayer, we are filled with the Spiritand find more of our prayers answered as conforming more and moreto His perfect will. When we receive more of the Giver Himself,the gifts/blessings come along as added benefits, but if we focus on the gifts/blessings, we lose out on deeper communion/intimacy with the Giver, the Lover of our souls.Makes an excellent gift and is one of those rare books that should be read multiple times in a year for maximum blessing!"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Since Hank Hanegraaff is a personal friend, I watched as this book took shape over several months. I was impressed that Hank is as candid in his writing as he is in his personal life. He is not embarrassed about his failings nor boastful about his triumphs. He looks for the lessons God has for him in each event of his life. This makes The Prayer of Jesus an exceptionally valuable book for people to learn how praying like Jesus told us to can transform our lives. Even if he were not a friend, and even if I had not seen the book develop, I would still highly recommend it as a challenging and encouraging introduction to the importance of a Christ-centered, prayerful life. There are not false promises of quick fixes, material prosperity, or spiritual breakthroughs without discipline, commitment, or time. Thankfully, the book focuses on the daily practices that turn neophyte believers into mature Christian role models. I highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about putting God first."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"This book is awsome. It goes into great detail about why and how we should pray. It explains that Jesus is the prime example for prayer and even breaks down the lords prayer itself. It answers hard questions like, why doesn't the Lord always answer our prayers right away? or why does he not answer it the way we want? While explaining this, it gives scriptural background with verses of the Bible. Above all Hank Hanegraaff makes incredibly strong points which make you think a little;(for example how we need to focus on the approval of the Lord rather then men or how we would be in trouble if God really gave us everything we asked for). Hanegraaff shows why we need to ask God questions, even though He already knows them, and why we praise him even though He already knows we love Him. The reason I enjoyed the book was because it backed up what it said. It tells us how to be intimate with God and who better to follw then the master Himself,Jesus Christ. Thats why I rated this book a five"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"If you are looking for a scholarly study of the Lord's Prayer, this is not the book for you. This is a collection of folksy stories, tender insights, and pithy sayings. The vignettes are sweet and heart warming. The insights are clear and true. The sayings (I have highlighted them)are memorable.But the book doesn't explore the grandeur, power, and fullness of the Lord's Prayer as I hoped. I ended up knowing more about Hank but not much more about Jesus.But for the nuggets alone, it was worth the reading time:\\"The secret to prayer is secret prayer.\\"and\\"At present we are sandwhiched between the triumph of the cross and the termination of time - between D-Day and V-Day.\\"and\\"The tragedy is not in dying young, but in living large and never using your life for eternal significance.\\"These are precious gems and I appreciate the kindness, humility, and tenderness he expresses; that much at least, is certainly like Christ."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"This book is Hank Hanegraaff's answer to \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\" by Bruce Wilkinson. It is not ONLY an answer to Jabez, it is also a great book on prayer. But the small size and similar shape and quick readability of \\"The Prayer of Jesus\\" makes it perfect to hand someone who has swallowed the Jabez trend hook, line, and sinker.Hank politely and appropriately points out the errors in Jabez, while not tearing down Jabez's author of the whole concept indiscriminately.But the focus in this book is on the prayer of JESUS taught us to pray! I especially liked Chapter 8, titled \\"The Armor\\", which contains a fictional letter written from the enemy to one of his own, C.S. Lewis \\"Screwtape Letters\\" style.While this book isn't the best I've read on the topic of prayer, it provides a much-needed balance to the Jabez movement (as of now, 24 weeks on the Bestseller List).This book is one that I will definitely re-read. It would make a great gift - there's a lot of \\"meat\\" here in a small package. You might already by aware of Hank's ministry as \\"Bible Answer Man,\\" a daily radio show. Hank is Founder and President of the Christian Research Institute - the website is Equip.org.You might want to buy several copies of this book - give a gift with an eternal value!Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music!"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"The author gives us an orientation to prayer based on Matthew 6:9-13. His guidelines include making a shift in our praying from simple supplication to a much broader relationship with God. This is possible if we increase our daily study of the Bible, make prayer a priority and above all find that special place where we can pray in secret. Our model for the practice of praying in secret is Jesus Christ Himself.The formula put forth by Hanegraaff sounds simple but I am sure it is not easy to successfully follow. Do I dare to give it a sincere try? Do you? The rewards may be huge."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"My wife bought me this book a few months ago; she knows I am a fan of Hank Hanegraaff, and enjoy his books. This is actually the third book of his that I have read, and I can't wait for an opportunity to give this book to someone in need of a text that discusses the model prayer of Jesus. I saw Hank Hanegraaff speak about his book a few weeks before it hit shelves, and he was very excited about it. I think that this book definitely lives up to his hopes.Primarily, this book discusses in detail the Lord's prayer, or the prayer of Jesus, as Hank Hanegraaff terms it. I think that this book beautifully explains, in plain language, the careful wording and underlying meanings of the prayer that Jesus wanted to leave his friends with.For me, the foremost thing that I took away from this book was that I don't need to pray for tomorrow and next week and all of my long term goals and needs. Jesus leads us by example and shows me that I need only to pray for my needs \\"this day\\". Again, I enjoyed this little book a great deal, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Instead of building a book on a little known verse in 2Chro. Hank writes a great book based on the best example of Prayer where Jesus Himself taught us how to pray. He uses some of the classics on prayer like Ryken's &quot;When you Pray&quot; and C. Miller's &quot;Into the Depths of God &quot; to aid him. This is a great book and one that I pray will get the Christian community back on track after the fad of the latest book fades into the sunset."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"The Prayer of Jesus is a well-written reply to the Prayer of Jabez. While the Prayer of Jabez has some positive aspects, as long as one focuses on asking God to increase your territory in ministry as opposed to increasing your territory financially (which is the unfortunate spin some put on it), the Prayer of Jesus focuses on prayer as a way to get to know God as opposed to prayer as a way to ask for things. Hanegraaff has written a nicely balanced book."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"This is a very small book that has a lot of good content. It is only 96 pages long, but it packs a punch.The focus of this book is clearly on one strengthening his/her relationship with God. It is a book that can be read multiple times while gaining more insight each time through. It would also be a great gift.Centered around The Lord's Prayer, the author has done a pretty solid job of dissecting that model and showing how to incorporate those principles into one's prayer life. I really think that the author could have doubled or tripled the content and made it much better. It appears that his goal was to keep it concise and it is certainly that.Although I think it could be better, I still think that it is very good. It is one of the better books on prayer that I have read. It is certainly far superior to the similarly sized 'The Prayer of Jabez'. There is no comparison in terms of spiritual content. Whereas the Jabez book is centered around a consumer's prayer life, this one is focused on real spiritual growth. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Excellent concept of the Son Jesus Christ praying to the Father God in the Heavenlies, before he (Jesus) was crucified and died, Hank Hanegraaf makes an exception in this wonderul book about Jesus Christ communicating (modern terms) with the Father God, before his execution here on this earth 2thou and 1 yrs past (BC) era, Jesus Christ prayed to His father God, in the OUter-space Heavenlies, to present himself the 'Savior of the World' before rising from the dead. Also the Author Hank H. magnifies the person of the person praying to the father - 3 Persons in one God, God/Jesus Christ/Holy Spirit/ in one facet of communicating to the Father 3+1=1 - and then Hank quotes, NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER GOD, BUT BY JESUS CHRIST' -- the author gives the exact reference--in the Word of God, interpreted by the Holy Spirit forcees.Now in modern times, we call it 'personal'interceeding prayer' to the Father above which is by Jesus Christ. Hank quotes Jesus Christ, the son of the Father God, interceeding for human-kind.Please buy this book to ascertain yourself with the prayer of Jesus Christ to the Father-God above in the Heavenly places.End***Lindsey- New York City"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"If Bruce Wilkinson had not written his great little book on the prayer of Jabez, Hank Hanegraaff would not have written this book on the prayer of Jesus. This little tome has several statements that are anti-Jabez - though they're subtle, polite and discrete. The discerning reader will find them easily.I expected the book to jump right in to a discussion of the Lord's Prayer. It did not. About one-third of the book is devoted to New Testament scriptures about prayer, mostly from the Gospels. That leaves only about 60 pages that deal specifically with the Lord's Prayer. To me, that made the title somewhat misleading.Wilkinson wrote the Prayer of Jabez with a great deal of personal testimony about how God had worked in his life. Hanegraaff does not write this way. I do not doubt that Hanegraaff is a praying man, but he does not offer testimony about how God has worked in his life because he devoted himself to praying the Prayer of Jesus. I believe this is important for the customer to know.If you want to read a book on the Lord's Prayer written by a man who has made a practice of praying the Lord's Prayer, I would suggest you buy Praying the Lord's Prayer for Spiritual Breakthrough by Elmer Towns.Hanegraaff's book does contain some useful information, but it is not my first choice of books on the Lord's Prayer."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Sorry, this book just did NOT meet expectations. I was immediately troubled by the constant praises to golf. I like golf but I really started to feel that Tiger Woods was the lord of Hank's life instead of Christ. Life's focus is to save souls not hit a ball in a hole! Then towards the end of the book he reveals that money is more important to him that his family. And for the $10 and so little content, I really feel this is just a moneymaker designed for those who would rather read a little book to feel spiritual instead of the Bible. This book is a \\"Prayer of Jabez\\" bandwagon, lining people's pockets. By the time I finished reading it (a short one seating reading) I felt I had been giving Hank too much credit over the years. A good reminder I guess, to only put you trust in Jesus, everyone else will let you down.The rest of the book was just old Sunday School teachings, nothing profound. If you have no prayer life this book may be useable to you if you can get it for $1, but for everyone else, PASS.I don't like to sound so harsh on the Bible answer man, but I have just come to expect a higher standard from him. I'm sure he wishes he had taken more time to write it too."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","review":"Hank couldn't quote the truth if he was given a script. He continues to lead people with his false teachings."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Old Testament: A Guide for Exegesis","review":"This collection of essays is primarily a text intended for graduate students of theology or biblical studies or for individuals researching sermons, in either case with some knowledge of Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek assumed, or at least preferred. But anyone interested in Old Testament exegesis will gain a great deal from this book. Interestingly, it seems that, for most of us, personal knowledge of ancient languages is less necessary to the close study of the Jewish Bible (what Christians call the Old Testament) than it was in the past. Careful comparisons of the many translations now available (based on two respected approaches to translation) may be of more value than one or two years study of biblical languages. Critical exegetical guidance, commentary and insight are also readily available and these sources begin with the ancient exegetes, whose works are also available in English and other modern languages -- these many sources notably including Philo, Origen, and the Talmudic rabbis, for example. One must notice that the ancient exegetes recognized the need to be careful, even tentative, in light of their own cultural, literary, and religious assumptions -- how much more so should we, so many centuries and cultures removed, be careful? From the ancient exegetes we learn scholarly humility and the necessary respect for our separation from the Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) literary conventions and contexts of the texts, apart from which understanding is not possible in many instances.Broyles reminds us that, \\"although divine in origin, the Bible is not a book 'dropped from heaven,' without human mediation. Nor is it a handbook of theological principles that are immediately accessible and applicable to all cultures at all times. It uses literary forms and imagery that are not immediately plain to modern readers (e.g., why does Yahweh call to the heavens and the earth when bringing an accusation against the people in Ps. 50:1-7 and Isa. 1:2-3?). Its many obscure references--from Abaddon to Zion--illustrate that the Bible is wrapped in history. The Bible makes the profound claim that God acts in history, but this entails a need for history lessons. Even the most uninitiated reader of the Bible soon becomes aware that God's means of revelation are human, including language, literature, history, and culture.\\"Over against the simplistic \\"proof texting\\" approach which children learn in Sunday School, and which easily fails critical examination (perhaps as easily as by mere counter- proof texting), sound exegesis is a process of organic synthesis by which we first spend some effort gaining a sense of the forest before \\"we proceed from the 'forest' to the 'trees'.\\" While some of the essays here are less useful than others, Broyles' contributions, as well as those of Long, Bimson, Martens, and Hess, are particularly good and overall the book is excellent. The merits and problems of all serious approaches come into play, including the so-called documentary hypothesis, form and redaction criticism, and other contemporary approaches. \\"Before we become immersed in details we should first get an impression of the whole; otherwise, the parts . . . become mere segments of a photo, without any frame. . . . As noted above, the steps of exegesis must not be conceived as linear; that is, one does not finish a step and then proceed to the next. Each earlier step--especially the thematic statement--must be revised in light of later findings. Its polished form should, in many respects, be the prize of the exegetical process.\\" (p30-31) Those interested in epistemological theory will recognize this approach as being so-called Contextualism, that is, I believe, the soundest process of seeking and building knowledge.Both defenders and detractors of the texts often poorly understand the paradoxes and seemingly odd contradictions of the Old Testament. Some time ago I read Friedman's \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\", probably the best book promoting the Documentary Hypothesis, but one that I expect will disturb many Christians. For such individuals, and for those anxious to familiarize themselves with both so-called \\"higher\\" (source) and \\"lower\\" (textual) criticism, this book is highly recommended, as it is for anyone interested in better understanding the complexities of the Old Testament, writings that are \\"more than history, not less than history.\\""},{"Title":"Only Parent","review":"I borrowed this book from another library and loved it.

Could it be she was considered intractable and was thrown out of this unnamed Community, and now has a \\"beef\\" with the entire Roman Church? At any rate, the book is well researched, and typically expounds the usual Fundamentalist attitudes towards the Roman Church. If one is a raging anti-Catholic, you will find all of your stereotypes met, and can say to yourself, \\"I knew it all along.\\" For Roman Catholics, it may cause you to think and do some research on your own beliefs, and that of your Church.

Mary Ann Collins facts are skewed to convincing others that the Roman Catholic faith is not to be believed or trusted. I would suggest that anyone interested in reading this book, also go to solid Catholic sources and to double check her support for her 'facts'. The Catholic Church is based solidly on scripture and tradition. Study the history of the CC beginning with the Apostles, and 1st and 2nd century Church Fathers to better understand the Catholic faith. Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch, who learned from the Apostle John, are an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"The Catholic Undertow: A Manual for Former Catholics","review":"Mary Ann Collins hits the nail right on the head in this book. It is amazing that people go through their lives believing in such a bogus religion. I know because I was raised Roman Catholic. I am astounded by the TRUTHS that Mary Ann exposes. I read this book after leaving the catholic church but never before did I realize it is such a cult! This is a must read for anyone....catholic or non catholic.

The author tells a poetic, scholarly and delightful story of five Italian cities and how they became meaningful and memorable places, remaining so to this day.For those who have experienced the magical, transforming impact Rome, Florence, Venice, Siena and Pienza have on their visitors, David Mayernik unlocks the richly poetic ideas which are their very essence. An architect and traveler, his writing is filled with the passion of one who truly loves and understands the tradition of those great cities: the tradition of humanism.For all for whom life is, above all, a cherished series of discoveries and experiences, Mayernik extends a masterful invitation to explore those places which stir our souls and which demonstrate the highest fulfillment of our collective potential for cultural and artistic achievement. He then challenges us to again seek to create cities &quot;through which dance the Muses&quot;, cities which are &quot;built Ideas suffused with cultural Memory&quot;. Accept his gracious invitation. It is a journey you will treasure."},{"Title":"Timeless Cities: An Architect's Reflections On Renaissance Italy (Icon Editions)","review":"Mr. Mayernik transports the reader to the glorious past of Rome, Venice, Florence, Siena, and Pienza; a past in which city builders sought to make their cities into reflections of the perfect heavenly City of God; a past in which every stone, every building, every piazza was an episode of the larger urban narrative that played itself for its citizens as a great &quot;theatre of the mind.&quot;Mr. Mayernik's writing allows us to view the urban mythologies of these places not as History, events frozen in by gone times and no longer capable of speaking to present generations, but as living lessons in city building; he invites his audience to learn the 'language' of these five cities so that we too can build memorable places."},{"Title":"Timeless Cities: An Architect's Reflections On Renaissance Italy (Icon Editions)","review":"The idealistic author argues that cities require a predetermined purpose, a self-image that will be transcribed in its development through time. Conversely, a city's architecture and layout embody its memory and reveal its true nature. To illustrate this, the author discusses at some length the pre-18th century development of Rome, Venice, Florence, Sienna and Pienza.Needless to say, the approach is highly intellectual. The author for instance draws various conclusions from the architectural pun created in ancient Rome by the construction, back to back, of a temple to Venus, goddess of love (AMOR in Latin) and a temple to the city per se (ROMA in Latin). In Venice, he likens all of piazza San Marco to an open-air church _ the Basilica acting as the sanctuary _ whereas the shape of Sienna's Campo is described as an analogy to the Virgin's protective cloak.This requires of course on the reader's part a good prior knowledge of the cities discussed and the book would in fact definitely benefit by being more systematic and extensive.Unfortunately, illustrations are in black and white and not up to par with what is now expected for such a topic. Even the image on the cover page is strangely unappealing!Despite these shortcomings, many planners and city-lovers in general will find this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Timeless Cities: An Architect's Reflections On Renaissance Italy (Icon Editions)","review":"I can't say this is very well written, and it often drags, but it's quite interesting to hear a working architect's opinions on renaissance architecture -- not just that of art historians or other scholars. You shouldn't think it's highly technical, but it is somehow more like an engineering book than a humanistic one (though he does touch on social history, rivalries between cities, and famous personages). An interesting addition to your library if it already includes some books on this area."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Leisure Business Success: A Manager's Guide to Achieving Success in the Leisure and Recreation Industry (Haworth Marketing Resources)","review":"This book is a fascinating read, relating the story of a manager thrust into a run-down recreation club and transforming it into an effective organisation in two years. The location is Saudi Arabia, with significant religious constraints on western management and the substantially western hospital staff for whom the club is run. The author studied for his MBA after this experience and is therefore able to draw out the relationships between the management problems faced and the principles expounded in the management literature.

The students absolutely love its easy to read style as well as the international aspect of its content (the case study deals with a company that employs workers from over 72 countries).All in all, FLBS has proven to be a reader-approved business book that dispenses with the grind of academic jargon and presents the study of business from a hands-on practitioner's viewpoint."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Leisure Business Success: A Manager's Guide to Achieving Success in the Leisure and Recreation Industry (Haworth Marketing Resources)","review":"At last, a truthful, real-life management book that focuses on the lucrative recreation and leisure profession. This is a well written and fascinating read that marries practitioner oriented reality with academic theory. The results are most interesting. The text focuses on a leisure business turn-around that succeeded under the most difficult of circumstances. While becoming completely immersed in the story, the reader suddenly finds that the basics of modern business management have been grasped. Well done."},{"Title":"ANNIHILATION","review":"This is a beautifully realized account of a day in the life of a small town in eastern Poland in the early 1930s. Szewc has an eye like that of Proust. Details are lovingly recorded, all in an effort to preserve the day-to-day--a day-to-day that will be destroyed, one might add, during the Holocaust. The book is also beautifully translated."},{"Title":"ANNIHILATION","review":"The intent of this beautifully written, poetic book is to capture a day in the life of a village. While there is wonderful use of symbolism, the book ultimately fails on two counts. First, there is no reason for the selection of whose lives to follow through the day. Second, the narrator vasillated between omniscient (even knowing dreams and memories) to limited only is visible. When limited, the narrator engages in speculation and philosophic reflection.This has an author worth watching, but as a novel it is an interesting, beautiful failure."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"Mr. Jones takes on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. A more appropriate sub-title might be &quot;37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Distorted.&quot; There is really no explanation happening here.The intellectual dishonesty of the work is revealed from the outset in the first chapter &quot;Who will be the Final Authority?&quot; The author quotes a conclusion of Catholic catechesis regarding the relationship of &quot;God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture, and the Magisterium&quot; without bothering to explain the reasoning behind the conclusion. The teaching that leads to the conclusion is clearly expressed in the preceding sections of the catechism and is conveniently ignored by the author. He falsely pits Tradition, Scripture, and Magisterium against each other, before correctly declaring that the Church claims for itself the authority to authentically interpret Scripture.What follows argues strongly for the Catholic position, for we are treated to the author's apparently authentic interpretations. An example of classic Jones reasoning -- &quot;The Bible boldly declares that it is the only final authority: 'Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.' Jn17:17&quot; Some argument.While he admittedly does show some talent for random verse slinging, sadly Jones appears incapable of constructing a coherent argument. He never touches on why one should accept the Bible as the inspired Word of God. It is nice for one to establish an authority prior to appealing to it. The catechism does in fact do this, but it would be difficult for the author to adopt as authoritative that which he seeks to discredit.Following an argument is not his strong point either; quoting a section on prayer, the author concludes that the Church &quot;proclaims that the Scriptures can't teach you how to pray.&quot; What the quoted section says: &quot;Nor is it enough to know what the Scriptures reveal about prayer: one must also learn how to pray.&quot; It continues by saying that the Holy Spirit teaches us how to pray.Regarding the Eucharist, Jones offers this: &quot;When Jesus said, 'Take, eat: this is my body,' He was not suggesting that they reach out and begin eating His literal body. To even suggest such is ridiculous.&quot; Based on this shallow understanding it is ridiculous to suggest that Jones is capable of explaining the doctrine. He is not impressive on the other sacraments either. He incorrectly asserts that the Church teaches that Confirmation is one of the sacraments necessary for salvation.The list goes on. The author simply does not deliver on what a reader would expect from the title. He is ineffective in explaining the &quot;37 doctrines,&quot; hence contributes nothing to understanding Catholicism (if this was indeed his intent).Weak, there is simply no other word to describe it.The second star is for the nice cover."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"I was pleased to find the \\"pre-chapter\\" in this book, called \\"Who is The Final Authority,\\" would present a solid proof that I could use with my Catholic acquaintances to show them that, as Rick Jones says at the end of the chapter, &quot;Scriptures plainly state that they alone are the Word of God.&quot; This is important also because he uses it as a basis for his proofs in the rest of the book. As I re-read it and looked up the verses he used, I was also able to learn more about Sacred Scripture and my faith in God and Jesus. As I dug into the chapter and the Bible I realized that Rick Jones has not proven that it is as \\"plainly stated\\" as he says. Worse, when I tried out some of this on some Catholics, they referred me to some other verses that I hadn't looked at. Those verses plainly state that the Church, Catholic or otherwise, may also be a source of God's Word.The closest Rick Jones comes to proving his proof is on page 13, Revelation 22:18-19, \\"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book,\\" and on page 15, Proverbs 30:5-6, \\"Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him. Add thou not unto His words.\\" But did John know that his Book of Revelation was going to be part of Sacred Scripture? Didn't he write after Proverbs 30 was written? Did Moses write down every last word that he heard from God? He didn't write down the names of the Egyptian magicians, but somehow Paul knew their names, 2 Timothy 3:8. I'm sure that God would know what would be the final version of the Bible, but not every one who has read these things knew that. Were they supposed to reject the Book of Revelation based on Proverbs 30? Proverbs 30, if anything, rejects the arrival of the entire New Testament for the people who already knew Sacred Scripture.How can this be? Are there better verses available for proving the validity of Scripture? Why didn't Rick Jones use them? If not, then the Bible does not plainly state that Scripture alone is the Word of God, and instead plainly states otherwise. So to know when Scripture is plainly stating and when it isn't, I'm in the position of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8:31 who needs someone to explain things to him. Or the disciples on the road to Emmaus who needed their eyes opened, Luke 24:32. Who has the authority to open my eyes and explain things to me? Rick Jones? The pope? John Calvin? Bill Burrer?I can and certainly have prayed to the Spirit to guide me on this. But Catholics make that claim, too. How do I prove to them that the guidance they received was not really from the Spirit? If, as Rick Jones plainly states in his note on page 21: \\"...the written Scriptures plainly state that they alone are the Word of God...\\" then Rick Jones' words are not the Word of God.This book has already been useful to me in helping to build my faith and love for the Bible, but Rick Jones seems to have laid a foundation of sand for proving to others what he believes about the Word of God. I will proceed to read the rest of the book. Are the proofs going to get any more solid than they are in this non-proof?"},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"If you metaphysically draw this type of anti-Catholicism out to its conclusion, you will soon see the fallacy of its posture. It absolutely defies logic, and you will see why when you do your homework while reading this book. The average Catholic should be able to wave it away as a preposterous side-show. The humor diminishes, however, for those nominal Catholics who are foolishly drawn out of true Christianity by this type of rhetoric, and purchased, soul and all, by the preposterous claims of anti-Catholic Fundamentalists.The author claims, in his introduction, to have been a Catholic prior to being \\"saved\\". This commonly played scenario is the sad irony of someone leaving the absolute fullness of Christianity for pieces and parts of the truth which are but a caricature of the real thing. While these folks may discover a relationship with Jesus Christ, it was there for them all along in the Catholic Church, in far greater measure.Another sad irony is the fact that Fundamentalists themselves have already bought the story they espouse, hook, line and sinker. This creates a paradoxical dimension in which they exist, one that embraces part truth and part falsehood, part love and part hate. When I read anti-Catholic literature of this sort, I find it difficult to decide which is greater: the authors' love for God or hatred for His Church. But in their ignorance they, too, are deprived of the fullness of truth in their stubborn insistence on the issues and refusal to listen, which must have a negative effect on their souls. However, it is especially funny, objectively speaking, to listen to them expound on the doctrines of the Church, which they have got all wrong, and obstinately reiterate and insist on what they believe when a well-informed Catholic will try to correct them. They always know more about the Church than we Catholics!This book must be read with the skill of critical thought, which is direly lacking in many Catholics and Fundamentalists alike, leaving them defenseless against the arguments used against Catholicism (not to mention the illogical and un-biblical doctrines of Fundamentalism). We need to have a filter trained into us to separate the inane from the profound, lies from the truth, superfluities from necessities, fallacy from logic.Do not read this book without cross-referencing the source material, which consists of the Catechism and the bible. Yes, even check the bible, for many of the verses are used completely out of context. One would be remiss not to do such simple homework or he is a sucker. I may have been duped had I read this book years back, thinking that Catholicism was leading me to certain damnation. Having done my homework, however, I simply took it with humorous contempt. I will not be duped.Herein lies another sad irony, that the author, in his zeal to debunk the Church, has stooped to deception to achieve the results he desires. There is no integrity in his method. Omissions and misquotes are used to bear false witness. How Christian is that?"},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"I have no formal education in theology, yet I could go down Jones' entire list and refute him on every point. Jones frequently misrepresents the Catechism, and his biblical refutations of Catholic doctrines amount to nothing more than shallow proof-texting.His most egregious misrepresentation of Catholicism is in the chapter entitled \\"Are Catholics Christ?\\" When the Catechism quotes Augustine as saying \\"Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ,\\" Augustine is referring to the fact that the church (the body of all believers) is Christ's body. The Bible explicitly says that this is so (Ephesians 1:22-23). Since every believer is a member of Christ's body, a part of His body, in that metaphorical sense we can truly be called Christ. Mr. Jones should remember that when Jesus confronted Paul on the road to Damascus, He didn't just say \\"why are you persecuting my followers,\\" He said \\"why are you persecuting ME.\\" (Acts 9:4) Jones ignores the context of Augustine's quote and pretends the Catechism says \\"we are Jesus. We are perfect and divine.\\"Again, Jones takes Aquinas out of context. When Aquinas says that \\"The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods,\\" he is merely reiterating the words of Peter. \\"Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.\\" (2 Peter 1:4) Aquinas is not saying that we can become equal to God. He is merely stating the biblical truth that through faith in Christ we can be made to share in God's holiness and in His divine nature. \\"Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken--\\" how is it that Jones accuses Catholics of blasphemy when we describe salvation using the very same words?He does the same thing in the chapter entitled \\"Mary Saves.\\" When read in context, all the Catechism says is that Mary, by consenting to bear Jesus, helped to bring about our redemption. She is not the redeemer; only Christ is. But Mary, through her obedience to God, helped bring the redeemer into the world. Also, when the Catechism speaks of Mary interceding on our behalf, it is not saying that Mary has a role equal to that of Jesus; it is merely stating that Mary, since she is in heaven, can talk to Jesus, can pray for us, and can present our prayers to Him.It is interesting to note that many of the quotes Mr. Jones objects to are from the early church fathers. Apparently he has some sort of visceral hatred of first and second century Christianity. Oh wait, I thought Catholicism wasn't invented until Constantine merged Christianity with paganism?But perhaps even more repugnant than Jones' falsehoods is the disgusting, patronizing tone that he uses throughout the entire book. He is incredibly condescending. He is always talking down to \\"precious Roman Catholics\\" and his \\"Roman Catholic friends,\\" and telling us how we need to repent from biblical truth and embrace his 16th century traditions of men. It sickens me.Even the title of this book is misleading. By calling it \\"UNDERSTANDING Roman Catholicism: 37 Doctrines EXPLAINED\\" he gives the false impression that his book is a beginner's course in Catholic theology. He most likely did this so he could sneak this book into the hands of unsuspecting Catholic adolescents. The man is truly a wolf in sheep's clothing.Jones is guilty of bearing false witness, and is storing up wrath for himself at the day of judgment. He must repent and turn to Christ before it is too late."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"Being raise Lutheran (cousin to the Catholic's) I see right were they get their wrong doctrines.

It is even sadder to twist thier own words to put them in a bad light. Mr. Jones claims to simply quote the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Bible. He is correct in that but more often than not the quotes are partial quotes that do not even give a glimmer as to the theology being discussed. If you do read this book then be sure to check all references and really seek, with an honest heart, to understand. So much of what Mr. Jones makes out to be Catholic belief is misconstrued and presented wrongly. Some of his chapters even stab himself in the foot.

Because it can't.All it does is state a Catholic doctrine, then patch together a few out-of context verses to try to disprove it. It also is full of false assumptions, like;*The Bible says you are saved by faith. Therefore you are saved by faith ALONE.It tries to give Catholics more reasons not to believe something rather than take away the reasons they do believe in it.

I'm a cradle Catholic and PROUD OF IT, and I'm disgusted at all the lies and misconceptions that this Fundamentalist heretic has come up with. Anybody who can actually believe this fiendish parcel of lies, must be mentally stunted! He quotes part of the Cathechism and leaves out very pertinent information in order to strengthen his claims. Where does he get the idea that the Holy Sacrements that our Lord Jesus entrusted to his Church are &quot;good works&quot;? And to call the Holy Eucharist &quot;cannibalism&quot; is sacrilege! I could go and on, They claim to interpret the Bible literally and yet they don't see the truth of what Jesus said: &quot;Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life within you&quot;(John6:53) He actually meant that literally but a heretic cannot see that. There's another passage that reads: &quot;anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself&quot; (1 Cor. 11:27-29). Another claim of theirs is that priests cannot forgive sins in the sacrament of Penance. He quotes all sorts of things but leaves out this very important one: &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained&quot; (John 20:22-23). I could go on and on!I've seen the reviews by former &quot;devout&quot; Catholics who joined this sect and can only say that they couldn't have been very devout to begin with if they could leave the safe harbor of the truth for this monstrosity!Our Lord warned us many times about false teachers and prophets, but how many people still refuse to listen! We have a saying in Spanish which states: God blinds those He wants to lose!The notion that &quot;The Bible is all I need&quot; is not taught in the Bible itself. (2 Pet. 1:20-21, and 3:15-16) which warns that private interpretation of the Bible could &quot;lead to one's own destruction&quot;. No one in the early Church believed in the Bible only theory, that only started with the Protestant reformation. The Catholic Church has never forbidden us to read the Bible as so many Protestants claim but they surely knew what could happen if everybody started interpreting Holy Scripture any way they like. That's why there are so many Protestant denominations and no two can agree on what the Bible means! Even Martin Luther who was a great proponent of making the Bible available to everyone, was exasperated and said something like &quot;Now even a dairymaid thinks she's a Bible scholar!

In fact even Scripture does not support these teachings. 2 Timothy 3:16 says that scripture is &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;profitable&quot; NOT sufficient. History (not the one fabricated by Chick Publications!) does not support the made-up revisions and half-truths purported by these professional anti-Catholics. I spent my entire life searching scriptures and early Church History and finally came to the conclusion that the Church IS the &quot;pillar and foundation&quot; of the Truth&quot; (1 Tim. 3:15).

Their end will correspond to their deeds.Outside of the Catholic Church this is what your dealing with."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"The author by listing all of the doctrines and practices of the RCC, shows how the finished Work of Christs Atoning death is diminished / made insufficient . Adding ANYTHING to the perfection of Christs work for our salvation nullifies it being a free undeserved gift ; this is a complete travesty. The author clearly shows how the RCC has its flock trusting in ADDITIONAL means toward their eventual eternal salvation ... even the deposited works and deeds of departed Catholics placed in the Churches Treasury Pot of Merits (CCC1477) . What a complete offense to the Lord in which the RCC claims they trust in. It is just like Satan to cleverly masquerade the RCC as 'THE' Church that Christ instituted . Nothing is further from the truth."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"Having Catholic friends and family members, I was very interested in reading this book. I read &quot;Understanding Roman Catholicism&quot; cover to cover, and even purchased a copy of the 1994 Catholic Catechism to independently verify quotes from the official cathechism itself. Every quote cited was word for word as it appears in the Cathecism. Jones argument is well thought out, and is a must read for Catholics serious about their relationship with God. If you love religion and tradition, however, you will find this book to be very disturbing."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"This book is entirely Scriptural based and represents God's truth! The Catholics who are criticizing it just don't want to face up to the truth that the Catholic Church adds to God's Word. They refuse to accept things God has established and would prefer to put their trust in a manmade institution. I am a former Catholic and finally see the light! God revealed to me what He wanted of me in His Word."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"Rick Jones did an excellent job in revealing the Catholic church's domination over it's flock. He points out that the Catholic religion is comprised of so much legalese, one can not experiencel the freedom that scripture promises, but in fact becomes enslaved by the doctrines. He also further implores us to check our belief systems, and does not introduce his own beliefs, but compares the Catholic church's doctrines side by side with scripture, the only authority of God. I was truly astounded and am quite frankly, fearful for the Catholic priests and the Pope who will have to address and account to God for leading so many astray, 'In the name of God.&quot; Woe be to them - we are to love the Lord with all our heart, and all our mind - use your intellect - do not be a leming!!!!!"},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"I was born, raised, and lived as a Catholic, until someone shared the Gospel of Jesus Christ with me. Now as a Bible believing Christian it is incumbent on me to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others. In doing so I enter into discussions with others, which include those who are of the Catholic religion. This book is a valuable tool in understanding the basis of Catholic doctrines, and examining them with the final authority (The Bible). This book was not written to trash Catholics, and I believe all Catholics should read it. They will be surprised how little they actually knew about the true root basis, and message of their religion, I was. It also gave me additional information to be able to address questions directed to official Roman Catholic doctrine (Catechism). No one should be afraid to search for the truth, if they have the right motives. This book will serve at least as a tool for self-examination, and encourage further Bible study.

As a former Catholic who never even considered leaving the Roman Catholic &quot;Church&quot; this is a real eye-opener. The book methodically details the difference between God's Word, The Bible, and the TRADITIONS OF MEN, the Catechism.If you no longer want to be brainwashed and realize the bondage you are in when it comes to the Catholic religion, read this book. God Loves you! That's the Good News. The question is, do you know Jesus?Jesus says, &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot;READ: He did not say through RELIGION, nor did He say THROUGH MY 'CHURCH', nor did He say THROUGH MY SACRAMENTS.Trust Jesus, and Him alone!"},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"Mr.Jones doesn't use the Bible very well. Take for example where he discusses baptism, praying for the dead, and confirmation. The Bible says and I quote, &quot;...even baptism doth also now save us...&quot;, But Mr. Jones implies baptism does not save. And he says the Church and the Bible are at odds. Mr. Jones believes infants don't have faith, but Jesus talked about the &quot;little ones who believe&quot; in him. Jesus says, &quot;Let the children come to me.&quot; People brought infants to him and Jesus blessed them. And Peter says , &quot;the promise (of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit in baptism) is for you and your children...&quot;(with no reference to a certain age)(Acts 2:38,39).Mr. Jones says praying for the dead is not correct. Well, that is because the Biblical book that supports the doctrine was removed from the kind of Bible Jones uses(the Catholic Church didn't add books to the Bible in the 1500's, it reaffirmed Biblical books that it used as early as A.D. 400). A great many Bibles since the 1500's remove the book that contains the verse,&quot;It is a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from sins.&quot; Mr. Jones also does away with confirmation(the laying on of hands shown in Acts 8:17 and 19:6). But not one verse in the Bible says to throw this ceremony out of the Church. Paul actually reminds Timothy twice about the gift received by the laying on of hands(1st Timothy 4:14, 2nd Tim.1:6). Jones says confirmation is not in the Bible but it is according to the Apostles(see the references in Acts and 1st and 2nd Timothy). Sure, the word &quot;confirmation&quot; is not in the Bible, but the ceremony is clearly described. The word &quot;Trinity&quot; is also not in the Bible, but that doctrine is described(the Father, Son, Holy Spirit). In this sense Mr. Jones would be obliged to remove the doctrine of the Trinity from his understanding of the Church and probably from his own beliefs too(if he believes in the Trinity like most Christians). It is very clear that Mr. Jones opinion of church ceremonies is at odds with the Bible and the Apostles who established the first groups of Christians. What Mr. Jones likes to do is show you quotes from the Catechism but he doesn't show you the Bible verses it uses. Instead he puts in his choice of verses that he believes disprove the Church. Basically he is not letting the Catechism,the Church, and Catholics speak for themselves. If you want to know what the Catholic Church teaches, read the Catechism and see all the scriptures it uses to support what is in it. Read some good books about the scriptural base for Catholic doctrine, &quot;Not By Faith Alone&quot;, &quot;Catholic and Christian&quot;, &quot;Prove it: Church&quot;, &quot;The Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, just to list a few good books."},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"I was pleased to find the \\"pre-chapter\\" in this book, called \\"Who is The Final Authority,\\" would present a solid proof that I could use with my Catholic acquaintances to show them that, as Rick Jones says at the end of the chapter, &quot;Scriptures plainly state that they alone are the Word of God.&quot; This is important also because he uses it as a basis for his proofs in the rest of the book. As I re-read it and looked up the verses he used, I was also able to learn more about Sacred Scripture and my faith in God and Jesus. As I dug into the chapter and the Bible I realized that Rick Jones has not proven that it is as \\"plainly stated\\" as he says. Worse, when I tried out some of this on some Catholics, they referred me to some other verses that I hadn't looked at. Those verses plainly state that the Church, Catholic or otherwise, may also be a source of God's Word.The closest Rick Jones comes to proving his proof is on page 13, Revelation 22:18-19, \\"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book,\\" and on page 15, Proverbs 30:5-6, \\"Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him. Add thou not unto His words.\\" But did John know that his Book of Revelation was going to be part of Sacred Scripture? Didn't he write after Proverbs 30 was written? Did Moses write down every last word that he heard from God? He didn't write down the names of the Egyptian magicians, but somehow Paul knew their names, 2 Timothy 3:8. I'm sure that God would know what would be the final version of the Bible, but not every one who has read these things knew that. Were they supposed to reject the Book of Revelation based on Proverbs 30? Proverbs 30, if anything, rejects the arrival of the entire New Testament for the people who already knew Sacred Scripture.How can this be? Are there better verses available for proving the validity of Scripture? Why didn't Rick Jones use them? If not, then the Bible does not plainly state that Scripture alone is the Word of God, and instead plainly states otherwise. So to know when Scripture is plainly stating and when it isn't, I'm in the position of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8:31 who needs someone to explain things to him. Or the disciples on the road to Emmaus who needed their eyes opened, Luke 24:32. Who has the authority to open my eyes and explain things to me? Rick Jones? The pope? John Calvin? Bill Burrer?I can and certainly have prayed to the Spirit to guide me on this. But Catholics make that claim, too. How do I prove to them that the guidance they received was not really from the Spirit? If, as Rick Jones plainly states in his note on page 21: \\"...the written Scriptures plainly state that they alone are the Word of God...\\" then Rick Jones' words are not the Word of God.This book has already been useful to me in helping to build my faith and love for the Bible, but Rick Jones seems to have laid a foundation of sand for proving to others what he believes about the Word of God. I will proceed to read the rest of the book. Are the proofs going to get any more solid than they are in this non-proof?"},{"Title":"Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained","review":"I've trused Jesus the christ as my savior since Friday, December 18th, 1998 when I was 11 years old.

This was difficult for me, because I was in a leadership position in our parish. I was a lector and an educator in the church's RCIA program, an adult education program for those wishing to convert to catholicism.My brother bought me this book, but I put it aside and didn't bother reading it. I thought it was propaganda that twisted the catechism for the purposes of bashing catholicism.Well, despite being a life-long catholic and despite being someone who actually was charged with teaching the catechism, I began to read the Bible and listen to a very educated Bible teacher. Many of the messages the teacher was giving me ran directly contrary to the teachings of the catholic church -- teachings I had, myself, been giving to others.In time, through my own self-education within the Bible itself, with research into scripture, with the help of learned Bible teachers and students as well, I finally came to the conclusion that the catholic church had strayed away from the truth of the Word. While the church may have, at one time, been true to Word, it clearly no longer is.The church taught me that my salvation was based on how I behaved, that I could be doomed to hell for my sins if I didn't seek absolution, and that is simply not the case.It was only after I learned the truth that I turned to this book. In that context, I highly recommend this book, even though there are certain parts that may bear further investigation on the part of the reader.My advice, particularly to those who are questioning the catholic church, is to read this book but don't take it completely on it's own. Instead, get yourself an Old Scofield Study Bible, read this book and research the material presented--then come to your own conclusions.The bottom line is that you can develop a completely personal relationship with God, that you don't need any organized religion to filter or otherwise mold that relationship, and salvation is a free, permanent gift that requires no church affiliation to obtain. It is yours for the asking.And remember: this is an honest review from a former life-long catholic who, after more than forty years and having been a lector and educator, found the truth in the Word.

The King James leaves these books out today because they are &quot;uninspired&quot;, but did you know it contained the seven books when it was first published? Anyway, Jones totally misrepresents Catholic Doctrine. He twists meanings. Buy it if you would like, but it is a waste of time and money. I would urge you to let Catholics defend themselves against...like this. If you do buy this book, I would suggest asking Catholics to explain it BEFORE you believe it.

These books have bright and colorful pictures, short accurate explanations of the animal, their habitat, eating habits, and even some of the popular anecdotes that go along with the animal.

Each book deals with three types of animal, such as Frogs, Toads, and Turtles. They are separated into sections dealing with each type. At the end of the section is a wonderful hands-on project the child can basically do on their own within the recommended age group (9-12) or with some assistance for a younger age group like my daughter.

The free drawing pages, the child can do on his own, however, the arts and crafts project may need an adult to help him with, unless the child is older than ten. When going camping as a family, this book can be helpful to use as a guide for looking for toads, frogs and/or turtles, and it can prove to be very handy.

For me, Metroid Prime was the only game in the series where I found myself backtracking more than an average Metroid fanatic might like, and it caused me to put the game down for a couple of years. However when I got this guide just a month ago, I was able to fully enjoy this wonderful game for the first time. The guide is very detailed. The maps have all the powerups shown and numbered (for missiles, powerbombs, and energy tanks) before each section of the guide. Not only that, but the guide was also made so a person could play the game from start to finnish without backtracking too much and get 100% on your first play.Now this is what I wanted from this guide and it nailed it. The guide is easy to read, has information boxes to tell you when certain expansions will become available, and also provides, for the most part, fairly good strategies as to defeating tough enemies and bosses. I recommend this guide for anyone who fells they have had to backtrack so much that the game was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Metroid(R) Prime Official Strategy Guide","review":"this game sucks it was cool til i got to level 4 but then it froze on me and wont let me play any farther then that"},{"Title":"Metroid(R) Prime Official Strategy Guide","review":"What Can I Say, I Would Be Lost Without This Guide.

I have found this out myself, there are 250 missiles in this game which means 50 expansions. I have personally counted the number of rooms to be 115. So if you take the number of rooms in the game(115) divided by(/) The number of missle expansions(50) 115/50 you get 2.3 so in about every other room there is a missle expansions. Of course there is the occasional room that has more than one expansion it so just look everywhere. But the missle expansions make a slight humming noise if you are any where near them. So with that in mind you don't really need a guide because Energy Tanks stick out like a sore thumb and every thing else (wave and ice beam etc.) sets out in the middle of the room in plain sight.and to get 100% in the log book you just have to put on the scan visor and look around in every room.

Mr. Keyes understands full well that the gay community suffers from what can only be called (and charitably at that)a moral handicap or more clearly, a moral disability. (This is not Keyes own argument but one that is implicit in the conservative movement's rejection of homosexuality as normality.) Homosexuality as a disability puts the whole movement in a new light. Keyes is opposed to spiritual devolution and those who try to pretend that their disabilities are a form of wholeness. Homosexuality is at best an attempt to balance something that is unbalanced, a seeking of masculine energy that has become disordered or was never in place to begin with. Genetic homosexuality would not change the parameters of this argument; gays are disabled in respect to those who have sexual desires that are channeled towards those of the opposite sex. As Gore Vidal once said, (paraphrased) being bisexual allows you to double your chances of getting a date. Homosexuality ensures that solitary masturbation will be improved with a partner. It might also be argued that masturbation is a homosexual act, so what might the big deal be about having a masturbation partner? It is around this issue that the crux of right and wrong, good and evil swirls. Homosexuality, I would argue is normal but so is murder and theft and rape. Are these desireable things? Take some time and think about it a bit before lashing out at conservatives who manage their genitals through marriage and make additional efforts to manage the wandering impulses of their testicles."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Dr. Keyes represents my views on a wide range of issues better than any other presidential candidate since I began voting in 1972. One thing that was especially cool about this book is that the speech selected as Chapter 1 -- a 9-minute talk at 1995 Republican event in New Hampshire -- is also available in online video archive at Alan Keyes' 2008 presidential campaign website -- http://www.alankeyes.comI write this in May 2008, and am glad that my favored candidate is now running for President as an independent. These are extraordinary times, warranting extraordinary levels of effort by citizens who want to see our nation embrace again the fundamental principles expressed in Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. Here in Maryland, as in states across the nation, his candidacy has prompted the petitioning for ballot access by new independent party. The Maryland Independent Party plans to enthusiastically offer Alan Keyes the use of our slot on the November 2008 ballot"},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"I like how rational Keyes' thinking is, and I entirely agree with his idea that our country needs to stop focusing on economics so much and start focusing more on our nation's cultural climate; this is actually in line with the views of many so-called &quot;ultra-leftist&quot; organizations like the Culture Jammer movement.I agree with Keyes that freedom entails not merely privileges and opportunities but moral responsibilities and sacrifices as well, and that our nation's culture has lost sight of these responsibilities and has suffered as a result.However, I think Keynes also exposes a few potential faults in his philosophy.For instance, Keyes criticizes Gay Rights activists by claiming that prohibiting discrimination policies against gays violates freedom of religion. This makes a good deal of sense. The Constitution/Declaration of Independence mentions nothing about sexual orientation, so it's OK to discriminate on the basis of it, particulary when that discrimination is based on religious conviction.However, I started to wonder what would happen if there was a religious group in America that believed that people with black hair are evil and should be killed. Clearly that would be unconstitutional since &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, and since the Constitution/Declaration of Independence override religious freedom, such a religious group must not be allowed to carry out its doctrine.But where do our rights in the Declaration of Independence derive from? As the Declaration says, and as Keyes emphasizes in his book, they come from God. A largely Christian conception of one, to be more specific.In other words, I think Keyes' text gives clear evidence that because our nation's ideology is founded on a Christian God, the precepts of our nation are a bit biased towards monotheism and Christianity in particular. Although the Declaration of Independence provides a solid moral foundation for our people to live by, they are biased against alternative moral systems espoused by other religions and philosophies; meaning that many Christian moral precepts (e.g., &quot;all men are created equal&quot;) are allowed to be enforced by the government while other non-Christian moral precepts (e.g., &quot;being homosexual should not be discriminated against&quot;) are not."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"&quot;Our Character, Our Future,&quot; by Alan Keyes, is edited by George Grant. In his foreword Grant notes that the content of this slim volume (135 pages) was gleaned from &quot;speeches, articles, comments and conversations.&quot; The main text is divided into 35 chapters, most not more than 3 pages long, in which Keyes looks at topics from his conservative worldview.Keyes covers a lot of ground--teen drug use, abortion, Afrocentrism, the controversy over Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, welfare, capital punishment, anti-Semitism, etc. But as a whole his perspectives lack depth. The chapters are just too short and sketchy, and he makes too many unsupported statements. He frequently attacks the Clinton administration, and also complains about &quot;intellectual fascists,&quot; &quot;dogmatic liberal judges,&quot; etc. His religious references and assertions will, I imagine, appeal to Christian conservative readers.A typically weak chapter is &quot;Outing the Left,&quot; where Keyes accuses Clarence Thomas opponents of &quot;anti-Catholic slurs&quot; and abortion rights supporters of &quot;religious bigotry&quot; without supporting his accusations. Another noteworthy chapter is &quot;The Rights Rage,&quot; where he suggests that gay rights activists &quot;quit while they're ahead&quot;--remarkably bad advice in light of the mountain of gay rights advances that have been made at so many points in both the governmental and private sectors since this book's 1996 publication date! Reading &quot;Our Character&quot; is like listening to a long diatribe by someone who keeps talking and talking and talking without really saying all that much."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Alan Keyes views are simply disturbing to me. Basically he's decided that all of the country's problems would go away if everyone were as holy and God-fearing as he is. This book is nothing but tired, religious-right rhetoric and sadly I've heard all of it before. He is also bigoted (he lumps gays and lesbians with pedophiles and rapists) and racist (&quot;I believe that, unwittingly, Jewish supporters of the government-dominated welfare state approach to the economic and social problems of the black community helped to create the mentality that now produces anger and anti-Semitism in black neighborhoods.&quot;) His ideas are so incredibly far to the right it borders on theocracy."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Keyes should have simply written one sentence instead of killing so many trees:Gays and religious minorities are not welcome.Makes me vommit."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"This book should be read by all college students. Why? Because at most universities, students get indocrinated with only the &quot;politically correct&quot; viewpoints. Read this book to see what the other side has to say. Well written and very thought provoking. Alan Keyes is a man of integrity, very well educated, politically experienced and he would be a great choice for a future US President. His book presents real solutions to problems and show the mistakes we have made in our culture. This book shows the truth. Also, a very simple, short and easy book to read and inexpensive. Should definately be in every conservatives library. As a Martial Arts teacher, I even make this required reading for all my students to help develop their mental and spiritual side and learn about current American culture. I can't wait for Alan Keyes next book to come out."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"After reading this book, I can see why people have a hard time putting a label on Alan Keyes. He's found a way to transcend the typical conservative vs. liberal tags, by -- get this -- looking to the Declaration of Independence (and a lot of world history) for our American &quot;Mission Statement.&quot; I especially liked chapter 3, where Dr. Keyes shows a hint of a Francis Schaeffer or Chuck Colson as he exposes our materialistic selfishness for what it is -- &quot;adolescents with a paycheck.&quot; After reading this, I was humbled by the high ideals Dr. Keyes described, and inspired to live the kind of life that extends beyond my own little self. A short book, it can be read in a day or two.

If you already have a healthy respect for the Declaration and the principles therein, then you are in for a treat. I know of no one who can put today's issues in perspective against the backdrop of American history the way that Dr. Keyes does in this book. He shows how important to our continued freedom is the understanding and acceptance that our rights come from our &quot; Creator&quot;."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Keyes makes it clear that our rights are not happenstance. They do not come from our laws, or our justices, or even our Constitution. As if he were a modern-day prophet, Keyes announces with boldness the same truth that was realized by our Founders- that freedom and liberty are authored by the Creator, and without said foundation there is neither. With undeniable logic demonstrating the fallacies of modern liberalism and uplifting the traditional values of American life, he roots these ideals firmly in the Declaration of Independence with a solid belief in the truths on which it is based. Keyes is a voice of clarity, in a wilderness of confusion, for our times- times in which we are being tempted to forget the noble passion, vision, and foundations on which our country was built. This is a book by a great emerging American statesman and is worth the read of all citizens willing to pledge their lives, their fortune, and their sacred honor to get back to the only truth that will set us free."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Mr. Keyes takes a stance on what he feels are the root causes for problems in this country in various different areas. Although you may not agree with all of his points it's refreshing that some people are actually intelligent enough to search for the underlying root causes for problems rather than just have government throw more money at them.The interesting thought process also explores how the liberal government programs are leading this country to a socialistic society, where our very rights to earn a living and profit from it are slowly being deprived in favor of spreading the wealth to non-working recipients, without giving them any ability or desire to change their own situations. Through taxes, and higher taxes for people earning more, the government is dictating just how much of your money they can take and redistribute to people who take no responsibilities for themselves, their families, or their obligation to contribute to society rather than take from it."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"\\"What sense is there in winning, in success, or even in prosperity if there is no truth.\\" So opens Allen Keyes' fabulous but short compendium of essays. From this initial line it's clear he opposes the modern American fad advanced by, as Keyes notes, the covert totalitarianism of today's \\"tolerant\\" crowd who hold \\"the bigoted opinion that if you disagree with them you must be pretending\\".As the only statesman and orator in America's last party primaries, Keyes is feared by some, not because he is black as Keyes once claimed, but because he is brilliant - a condition frightening to ignorance.One of Keyes central refrains is that \\"we don't have money problems, we have moral problems\\". But morality is not fertile in the American mind through the expected and intended cultivation of education where respect and honor are reached through the application of Enlightenment reason with an understanding of natural rights, founding documents, their supporting material and the Founder's source and positions on such matters. Instead, for Keyes the moral alpha and omega are sourced in the Christian God, not reason, though he has a great talent for it. Where he fails is as a Creationist, wishing school boards across America could force Christianity into science class (tangentially referenced in his last preachy chapter). Keyes' respect for deep, open education is thus in doubt, mixed in the very least. And yet, on the contrary, Keyes has a respect for science, apparently as long as it does not squeeze his beliefs.An Alan Bloom disciple, Keyes knows alternative ways of thinking, giving him a capacity to see beyond his time and place. With this tool his book is a bit of revelation every other page."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"Alan Keyes makes a strong case that there is a link between the Christian heritage of the United States and God's blessings. He does so by presenting the facts and showing how the nation has strayed off course. Keyes has always been bold in articulating his convictions publicly. His approach is to let the chips fall where they will. He is courageous and straightforward.The chapter I found particularly insightful was the one on consumerism. In it he explains that the media create \\"needs\\" for \\"perpetual teenagers.\\" He contrasts this with maturity, i.e., self-control--which the media portrays negatively. He concludes that \\"consuming passion means self-destruction.\\" The media feeds the consumerism impulse. It sells goods and services, but in the meantime media users' self-control grows weaker and weaker over time."},{"Title":"Our Character, Our Future","review":"If you think that the Declaration of Independence is no longer relevant I dare you to read this book.

She says she has Yuki's life planned out, and Yuki has to learn how to make his own decisions. We also see the climax of the Yuki and Ayame subplot in this volume. Tohru starts looking into whether or not Kureno Sohma is the guy that Uo has fallen in love with, and she also learns a secret about Momiji and his little sister. In this volume, we also see Tohru's class take their class trip.There's definitely a lot of character development for Yuki in this volume, but we really get to better understand both Yuki and his brother, Ayame, after we meet and see Yuki's mother in action. I also like how we get to see a little more concerning Momiji and his relationship with his little sister. By the time I finished this volume, I definitely found myself wanting to read more.

Most readers were probably expecting this to go down closer to the end of the series, but Aya is really a supporting character and the timing is just about right considering how much there still is to cover.Ayame himself admits that he bears his share of responsibility for Yuki's childhood situation deteriorating to the point it did and that he's lucky Yuki is on speaking terms with him. But he's so genuinely remorseful and trying the only way he knows how to make things up to Yuki that it's impossible not to root for him as he faces his moment of truth and squares off against their venomous mother to protect Yuki the way he should have years ago. Will Aya pull it off? Did anyone really think he was heading for a sad ending?Unlike Ayame, Momiji is completely guiltless regarding his situation. But sometimes innocence isn't enough and life isn't always fair. The selfless young man is asked to make yet another huge sacrifice for his immediate family when his little sister Momo, now old enough to walk short distances without adult supervision, begins to actively seek him out - and starts to get too close to the truth their father feels she isn't ready to handle yet.Perhaps the most seamless mixture of joy and angst so far."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 13","review":"In this 13th volume of \\"Fruits Basket,\\" we finally get to meet Yuki-kun and Ayame-san's mother when she attends a parent teacher conference. She already has Yuki-kun's life planned out, but can Ayame-niisan save the day?Yuki-kun, as president of the Student Council, then has to deal with the strong personalities that make up the Student Council officer. Can he survive them, especially Vice President who has a Power Ranger complex?Next, Tohru goes on mission to the Sohma Estate to meet with Kureno-san after coming to believe this is the man that Uo-chan has fallen in love with. Along the way, she has a chance encounter with Momo-chan, who reveals some very interesting things. Can Tohru meet with Kureno-san without Akito-san finding out?Finally, the class trip is finally taken. Yuki-kun, Kyo-kun, Tohru, Uo-chan, and Hana-chan are grouped together which is sure to lead to fun.In this volume, Takaya-sensei takes time to explore how Yuki came to be via his mother. This was an interesting story which showed how much Yuki had grown. Ditto Ayame. Yuki having to deal with the headaches of being Student Council President are weaker since the people that are the officers are mostly annoying.Tohru isn't as happy-go-lucky in this volume as in previous ones. However, I was glad to see the Momo-story touched again, not to mention there's table-setting going on for Kureno-san's character.With these stories being told, Takaya-sensei never forgets why we read the manga and thus doesn't lose focus on that. As such, she doesn't get bogged down in the story of Yuki and Ayame's mother. She doesn't get bogged down in the Momo/Momiji story. She continues to press forward, which helps a lot.As usual, Alethea & Athena Nibley do fantastic, otaku-friendly work. Considering that this debuted in the top-50 of book sales, then rose to the 30's the next week, I guess that goes to show that Japanese honorifics and other otaku language being left in the translation can enhance the readers enjoyment of the title. It certainly does mine.

Though it was nice to see the development between Yuki and Ayame, and between Yuki and the student council VP, I believe that the love triangle between Yuki, Tohru, and Kyo is the most intersting.

I didn't feel the culmination of the events between Yuki and Aya proved anything. I didn't understand the \\"tragic secret\\" about Momo. (I'm trying to not give anything away here) To me, the book just seemed like a filler. It was an interesting angle, with the Kureno story, but again, nothing got evenly remotely resolved.It could be that I am just bitter that the main story got put on hold. Perhaps I'm just angry because I would rather find out what is going to happen in the Tohru, Yuki, Kyo triangle instead of hearing about the crazy guy in the student council. But I just really, really hope that this series isn't going all \\"GAINAX\\" on me...throwing in big metaphors, thunderclouds of mysteries that never get unravelled, and laying it all under a big blanket of symbolism. I wanna know that these secrets will be discovered at the end. What is the curse? Can Torhu break it? What is with Akito and Kureno? Please, let this not be the end of my guilty pleasure in reading this series!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 13","review":"Correct book and the condition expected from a used book.The cover looks like some kid vomited on it. It should have been listed as &#34;acceptable&#34; instead of &#34;good&#34; so I wouldnt have bought it."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 13","review":"This is an amazing series and the pace really picks up in this volume where all the back stories of the characters start to come out. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"As evidenced by the numerous references, the author has been quite thorough in his research. However, the amount of detail bogs down the story, and it is quite easy to lose the greater picture. It would have served the story better to footnote most of the names and organizations. Of special note, however, are the drawings and photos from the period.Overall, this book is a good complement to others regarding the history of the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, such as \\"The Pentagon: A History\\", \\"Grand Avenues: The Story of the French Visionary Who Designed Washington D.C.\\", and especially, \\"Freedom Rising:Washington in the Civil War.\\"In addition to the main subject, the book touches on themes addressed in other books regarding urban development, such as the \\"City Beautiful\\" movement that was popularized after the Chicago World Expo of the 1890's, \\"urban planning\\", immiment domain, \\"smart growth\\", and the boundaries between public and private interests in influencing the development of a metropolitan area. Other books that touch on these themes include Janet Jacobs' seminal work \\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\\", as well as \\"Edge City, Life on the New Frontier\\", which devotes a large section to the evolution of the Tysons Corner area, and even \\"The Levittowners\\", a 1961 work which takes a sociological view of families migrating to Levittown, PA, a small surburban enclave of Philadelphia that was a developed by one of the nation's largest builders at the time, akin to today's Toll Brothers, perhaps.Lastly, if you would like to explore the idea of completely planned communities, such as Greenbelt, MD, which was a product of the New Deal era, consider reading works dating back to the Utopian movement of the late 1800s, such as Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward\\", and the ideas of Robert Owen, who created an experimental enclave in Scotland, and attempted to establish one in the U.S. as well.In the end, as I read these diverse works it helped me shape my own ideas regarding the public/private balance over land use and development. It's an interesting journey that enhanced my understanding of the issues, but yet I still feel overwhelmed by magnitude of the issue. Perhaps we will indeed evolve to the types of cities imagined by Isaac Asimov in his \\"Foundation Series\\" of books."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This was a present for my dad. It doesn't have a lot of pictures, but I think it will be a wonderful book. Very informative."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This is a timely book about Washington D.C.'s Metro, given the current controversy about its management, efficiency and reliability. This book answers many of the questions a typical rider of the Metro would ask. However, the writer provides far too much detail about all of the decisions that went into the zoning, planning and building of the Metro. It is very easy to get distracted and lost in each chapter."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"The author obviously spent a great deal of time doing research in preparation for writing this volume. It not only covers the history of the capitol's subway system, but the social and economic factors leading up to its construction. A very throught provoking history of a unique transportation system."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This book was recently loaned to me by a retired urban planner who has lived in DC through his whole career. As a regional urban planner, transportation planner, and history buff, I thought this book was an extremely informative and well-written story of:- the planning and construction of one of the most significant public works projects in American history;- the social, political, and economic history of Post-WWII DC metro area;- the interface between urban land use and transportation planning, and one of the major success stories of public transit in the modern era;- the battle between Congress and the community over self-government in post WWII DC;- the challenges of funding and operating public transit, even when the construction of the project is heavily subsidized by the federal government.This book should be required reading for any graduate student in urban planning or transportation planning, and is a great read for anyone who is interested in the modern history of our nation's capital."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This is not an easy read by any means. It is a slog but not so much because it's not interesting but more because the author goes into great detail to tell the complete story as to how one of the best commuter rail systems in the world (yes, not just the US) came about. What is even more amazing is how this got done decades ago in a time when public transit really was not on the agenda of most cities let alone a modern subway system.It's worth your time just give yourself a lot of it to weave your way through. Anyone who is fascinated by city planning and the push-me/pull-me of special interest groups, government red tape, business interests and the visionaries who pull it all together, well, your jaw will drop at how things eventually get done.To be honest, if you find some chapters not up your alley you can skip to ones that are. Personally, I was more into learning about the actual stations and the riders more than anything. I did find the chapter on the plans (which started in 1955!) very enlightening especially when you see the failures of other major U.S. cities to come to grips with transit and opt for freeways. It's ultimately a hopeful book because if D.C. can do it, certainly other cities can. A must-read really for all urban planners...and politicians as well."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"I first read this history of the Washington Metro for a class in my transportation policy masters program. But this is far more than a textbook for urban planners or transportation policy wonks. This is a well-written, entertaining book about one of the most visible and important projects of the latter-half of the 20th Century. The Metro is more than simply a subway for the nation's capital. It represents all of the challenges, successes, problems, and benefits of major transportation networks. The construction of the system demonstrated all of the political, social, and economic debates inherent with publicly-funded projects. Schrag captures it all and writes in a manner interesting to even the most casual of readers.The Metro fascinates people. Its growth and influence defines many communities in and around DC. Schrag brings to light so much of the history of the planning, political battles, and construction of the system. For those interested in anecdotes and urban legends this book will help answer many of those perpetual questions such as why there is no station in Georgetown or why the escalators are so long on the Red Line."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"...if you are a dc metro foamer...or just interested...this is the book for you. Meaty with information on planning and execution...nicely, but not lavishly illustrated, you'll have to get your photo jolly's from another source. Great book, though!"},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"As a DC Metro resident, I enjoyed reading how the Metro became what it is today. Interesting to see how the city developed around the different stations."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"That question, posed in slightly different form by Mid-City activists in Washington, DC during the construction of the Metro, is posed near the end of this fine history of \\"America's Subway.\\" Jonathan Schrag spends the 376 pages preceding it demonstrating that urban transportation is about more than moving people from point A to point B by chronicling the people and passions that shaped the most successful of the Second Subway Era systems. As the book's title suggests, the Washington Metro is also the product of a singular era in American politics, when the liberal idea that government could be a force for building a better society reached its zenith, but it is also the product of a worldview that reinforces the importance of the dense city as a desirable human habitat. Urban freeway building undermined that worldview, and Washington was almost unique in reasserting it in the face of powerful forces arrayed against it, including members of Congress in whose hands the fate of the national capital as a city rested. Even though the moment for grand projects like the Washington Metro has long since passed, lovers of cities can take as much inspiration from this well-written story as lovers of trains can, for it shows what is possible when the planets align just right."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This is very good book about an important piece of infrastructure in the Washington, DC area. The work covers every aspect of every neighborhood and also the politics behind the metro better than anything currently available. I wish there were books about other transport systems worthy of this one."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"I moved to DC in 1981 and watched the colorful branches progress from hash marks to solids. There are quirks in the system; this book answered many of my questions. Particularly interesting are the failed attempts in the 1960's to carve expressways throughout the district and later, the design evolution of the glorious system to replace the road plan."},{"Title":"The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro (Creating the North American Landscape)","review":"This is a wonderful history of the DC Metro System. This subway has provided the underground infrastructure to relieve mis-guided highway construction that threatened the District. Metro has provided the impetus for development in the Dupont Circle, 7th Street, and New York Avenue corridors. When the new basebal stadium is constructed, it will be served by 2 Metro stations and new development will occur there."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"I was constantly reminded of &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; as I read this book. The author used laws (80 compared to 48), as well as historical and political examples to make his point. This book is much shorter, making it an easier read. I enjoyed reading this book, but should have had a dictionary handy, as there were a lot of big words. If you like &quot;The Prince&quot;, &quot;The Art of War&quot;, or &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; you will like this book as well."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"This book has changed my life by refining my understanding of the cultural imperatives of personal power. How to deal with bureaucrats (situational power). How to gain more power within an organization. Valuable insights into the mindset of powerful people and the methods they used to become powerful. Universally applicable, from the mundane events of daily existance to the major decisions which will define your life. More than anything else I have read, this book has given me the knowledge to control my life."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"If you have an analytical mindset, it is difficult to trust your intuition. Mr. Siu showed me through historical examples of Asian and European power players how to develop and more importantly how to defend against amoral power players. These individuals have mastered what the Chinese call the art of Blackness. A benign example of this would be a medical professional who has decided to amputate the legs of a professional basketball player in order to save the player's life in spite of the players protests. Because of Mr. Sui's insights, I learned how to trust my intuition and how to recognize this type of individual who appears to be personally charming and a born leader. A darker example can be found in the White House. The author showed me how to recognize the trap before it is sprung. Learn how to see the clues which will reveal the total reality that is about to take place. Success in life can be attained by avoiding the trap."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"I have been a student of the philosophy, if not the practice, of war for as long as I can remember. I've read everything from Machivelli to Napoleon to Sun Tzu in an effort to study the nature of ruthlessness. The comparsions of this book to Robert Greene's work are unavoidable. But for any serious student of the nature of power this book is indispensible."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"In this book, Siu applies the philosophies of Machiavelli to the subject of power in the modern-day corporate and government realms. I learned a great deal from this book. In particular, it provided me with a lens through which I can identify and deal with the power plays that occur in every day life. While few will want to follow the recipe provided by Siu to obtain personal power through his methods, all can learn from them."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"This is not your pop-business or pop-anything book. It is a scholarly work that has global political reach, as well as personal impact. Part of the beauty of this work it how systematic it is in providing a well-rounded picture of power dynamics that transcend the century in which they play out."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"An ingeniously crafted book, Siu explores modern-day Machiavellian philosophy as it applies to the corporate and political realms. I found this book to be extremely educational, providing me with the information necessary to recognize and deal with the power plays that happen in every day life. Few will want to follow the recipe given in this book to pursue power, but all can learn directly applicable insights from this book. It is a real shame that it is out of print."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"While this book reminds me of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu and the The 48 Laws of Power, I personally think The Craft of Power has eclipsed them on a whole different level. The organization and method outlined in the book is effective and rigorous. I hesitate to say I think this is the most dangerous book I've ever read. While the control of power of the the book describes does take practice and years of refinement, none the less it spells out essentially ability to control whatever you desire."},{"Title":"The Craft of Power","review":"This is a scholarly tract on the essence of power. I have always liked this book and have read it several times, but I never would have even picked it up at current prices. The copy I have is a Quill paperback from William Morrow & Co. from 1984. It came from John Wiley & Sons, Inc. in 1979. So the book has been around a while and I thought it worthwhile enough to pick up another copy since mine has so many notes and underlines. I thought a fresh copy would be nice. I guess I'll pass. Brings to mind again the question of why similar containers/technologies have such widely variable prices in the market. It's just a book. Print some more. With all our vast computing powers it seems we could put out copies of any publication on demand at reasonable prices. The book itself seems to have some universal appeal judging from the other reviews. Perhaps other purchasers would feel the same if it were more affordable. Still, if there are no other options, it is always an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Rani (Doctor Who #107)","review":"Taking Peri to visit Kew Gardens, the Doctor's long list of enemies comes into play and the TARDIS is drawn off track to a mining village in 19th century England. And there not one but two renegade Time Lords are laying down their plans...This story is probably best remembered for introducing the Rani, a renegade Time Lord of the female gender (I really don't like to call her a Time Lady because she certainly isn't a lady!). Played with great panache on TV by Kate O'Mara, here in the novelisation by script writers Pip and Jane Baker she comes across very cold - perhaps colder than on TV. While I generally like the Rani, I do have a problem with the fact that the Bakers can't seem to show us that she is a genius - they have to have people tell us she is again and again and again...Also on Earth, and the reason for the TARDIS being knocked off course, is the Master. He draws the Rani into his plans for revenge on the Doctor and Peri, using her genius (about which he waxes lyrical on several occasions) by hijacking some of her inventions.The story suffers a little at the hands of the continuity craze that held the Doctor Who production team in its grip at the time. For instance, in speculating about who could have interfered with the TARDIS' journey, Peri suggests the Daleks might have been behind it. Peri hadn't met the Daleks at this point, and it seems unlikely she's know about their time travel technology.However, once out in the English countryside, the story settles down into a more acceptable state, and we get the spectacle of three Time Lords trying to outthink each other. A good thing which we rarely have had the opportunity to observe.The Bakers' writing style is OK, but I suspect it reflects their unfamiliarity with novel writing."},{"Title":"Bomba the Jungle Boy and the Lost Explorers; or, A Wonderful Revelation (#10 in series)","review":"HiThe book arrived in good time and was packaged well.

Every once in a while, there would be some spooky story and my father would read it to me before bed as I watched the shadows of some imaginary creature dance on my ceiling. And here they are, all in one book.Yankee Magazine is a far cry from its yesteryear, today. Nowadays, it's filled with advertisements for erectile dysfunction and hover-rounds.

All of the stories are written by different writers with their own voices, so each tale is fresh and exciting.This book also doesn't recycle every story you've already heard. Sure, there's the bloody apples, but a few of these stories I'd never heard before picking this up. Have you ever heard about the town whose roofs literally vanished from above their heads one night?It saddens me that this book can be purchased for as low as a penny, but at least there's no excuse for not owning it!This belongs in the library of anyone interested in ghosts, New England, or the strange events that take place in our wild world!"},{"Title":"MYSTERIOUS NEW ENGLAND","review":"My sister had this book years ago and I found the stories in it fascinating.

Deputy Wynatt insists that she's &quot;murder prone&quot; and it's turning out to be true.Peaches accepted the job as a feature reporter for the small town newspaper just so she could avoid crime scenes, but when a childhood friend arrives in her office telling tales of murder and mayhem, she doesn't have much choice. Belle claims Isaiah Hubbel is responsible for the death of her husband, but he's related to half the town and Belle has no evidence.Despite every intention to stay uninvolved in the investigation, Peaches finds Belle unconscious in the woods, then gets abducted at gunpoint by Hubbel's brother. When Isaiah turns up dead and Belle is the most likely suspect, Peaches doesn't believe she's guilty, and her own list of suspects grows longer by the minute. Using every available memory-sharpening tool, she finally remembers the clue that might give them the answers and takes off on a last minute quest, only to be ambushed by a killer intent on silencing her forever. Has she left enough of a trail for help to find her in time?For some, Peaches Dann is an old friend. For others, she's a new but quirky heroine. Squire has crafted an amiable character whose erratic memory and her attempts to compensate are endearing, as is her propensity to follow a trail to the truth, wherever it might be found. Squire has obviously found a formula that works. Forget About Murder is not a stay-up-all-night thriller - it's a cozy mystery with likable characters, a colorful setting and a highly satisfying conclusion.PJ Nunn for The Charlotte Austin Review"},{"Title":"Forget about Murder (Peaches Dann Mystery)","review":"It only takes a few pages of the latest Peaches Dann Mystery to realize you are reading a writer at the top of her form.

What's surprising to us (but not to them) is Teller's third choice, Frau Sarah Schenirer, founder of the Bais Yaakov network of yeshivos for girls.Teller makes every possible effort to relate only what is historically verifiable, but admits, &quot;the downside of all this is that some preconceptions may be shattered by the informations in the forthcoming pages, for like zucchini, myth has a long growing season in the lore of gedolim.&quot;This is no defensive hagiography.

He's so scathingly un-forgiving of those who dare try and pass off their feeble attempts at the various arts as \\"talent.\\" What makes his witty, biting assessments so potent is that his often brutal honesty is usually right on the money, as they say. Not that he doesn't occasionally find praise for certain performers or performances, but, it's his critiques of the often hypocritical, pretentious, or mediocre efforts of the entertainment business that will have you screeching in aghast hysterics, and, feeling relief that you're not on the end of his verbal sword. Sexy Rexy tells it like NO ONE else can, and his pieces on various personalities from this book, or any of his others, though they were written 20 years ago or more, are just as witty, fresh, and unique as his column, which you can still read today in The New York Observer. Though often written, you can be sure, with his trademark blase' sneer of contempt, he says what no one else DARE say, leaving the poor deflated victims in his wake. He is the most erudite, clever, brilliantly funny critic we've ever had. Whether it be a book, movie, social function (Liza's wedding!), or play, his yah or nay is needle sharp in its accuracy. \\"Conversations In The Raw\\" was the first book of his that I bought, and, after being so outrageously entertained and informed, I made it a point to acquire all of his books... most are out of print, but worth the search.

The portion relating to Vancouver was great with a helpful discussion of navigating your way around the city and its various neighborhoods. The restaurant/cafe recommendations were very helpful, and we thought, quite on the mark. Lodging recommendations were also on the money (even though we weren't thrilled with what we ended up with, but based on what else was available at that level of rating, the book's rating seemed to be right on). Finally, the section on Victoria and Whistler were especially helpful given our quick 'sojourns' to these areas. Oh yeah, we did a quick cross-reference of the ratings in this book with Zagat's and they were pretty much in line with each other. There were also lovely discussions in general about shopping in Vancouver (quite plentiful) as well as the parks and the top 20 attractions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Best Places Vancouver","review":"The Best Places books are outstanding for recommending the best sites to see and I particularly like the restaurant reviews. The hole in these books are the lack of maps. There's a double sided fold out map at the back of the book but that's it. There are no neighborhood maps.

The restaurent section is superb.I found various small resaurants that felt untouched by any tourist. I felt like a local after being there only a few days.

I began reading it and came across some new material and some old material presented in an interesting dydactic way. I thought, \\"This is really good and could improve our lovelife.\\" When my wife came in, after a laugh, I gave it to her to scan. We bought it and have thoroughly benefited from it. The concepts presented in the book and on the videos described in the book have significantly benefited us in our lovemaking and increased our intimacy. The information is graphic (its' strength) but not pornographic. I have already used some of the concepts in my therapy. I highly recommend it to get your lovelife off center. I am deeply commited to my wife and am thrilled by anything that can make our relationship better.

Linda's faith, unconditional love, humility, determination and humor should be how we \\"all\\" live our daily lives. Linda will live in my spirit for the precious woman she was and the simple, no nonsense way she lived her life. I admire how she always spoke her mind and how she always spoke the truth. If you are, or have been, a victim of abuse, I can't overstate how much you should read this book. If you want to see how a woman lives a Godly life despite adversities, you should read this book. Have you ever judged a person by their education, clothing, job or the way they speak? You won't after you read this book. Do you know someone who is engaged to be married? They need this book, too.

I give the book a 5 stars."},{"Title":"Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder","review":"My review is limited to the study of Johann Georg Hamann in the present volume, and the three star rating applies to it alone. Combining Isaiah Berlin's books on Vico, Hamann and Herder under one cover was a felicitous idea of Berlin's editor and literary executor Henry Hardy. The position which these thinkers share: their anti-Cartesianism, their emphasis on history, tradition, language and mythology may now be seen through the considerably different lenses they employ. I feel compelled, however, to register a caveat. When the present Hamann study appeared in book form in 1993, I expressed my reservations about it in a letter to the &quot;New York Review of Books,&quot; to which Berlin replied. I lamented the fact that he had ignored modern Hamann scholarship, and had clung to the interpretation of Hamann as an irrationalist, especially that espoused by Rudolf Unger in his 1911 book,&quot;Hamann und die Aufklaerung,&quot;ignoring modern discussions of the &quot;dialectic of the Enlightenment.&quot; Specialists in the field now consider Unger's interpretation outdated, and see Hamann as a champion of one side of the Enlightenment, albeit a severe critic of its other, extremely rationalistic, side.The question of Hamann's relation to the Enlightenment turns on the conception of reason. I have maintained that Hamann employed a mode of reason distinct from that of the rationalistic Enlighteners as well as from that of his friendly adversary,Kant. In order to designate that mode, I adopted a term once used by Kant in referring to Hamann's thought,i.e., &quot;intuitive reason,&quot; or, in the original German, &quot;anschauende Vernunft.&quot; I accepted the term as an apt one for Hamann's mode of thought, however Kant felt about it. Further, I have demonstrated how it can be linguistically distinguished from the traditional logico-mathematical mode of thought in my book &quot;The Quarrel of Reason with Itself&quot;(1988),and elsewhere. It is one which Berlin rightly sees as akin to Dilthey's &quot;verstehen,&quot; which Berlin also rejects. He lists a group of philosophers whose conception of reason matches his own: Jeremy Bentham, J.S. Mill, Franz von Brentano, William James, Bertrand Russell and the &quot;Vienna Circle.&quot; Most of these thinkers are about as far removed from any kind of &quot;verstehen&quot; as possible. Who then, besides Hamann, may be said to have employed what I have called &quot;intuitive reason&quot;? The prime examples are the great epistemological heirs of Hamann: Goethe and Nietzsche. Goethe belongs here because of his refusal to analyze the &quot;Urphaenomen.&quot; Hence, his anti-Newtonian stance. Nietzsche, especially in &quot;Zarathustra,&quot; which I have analyzed closely from the standpoint of intuitive reason in &quot;Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian Tradition&quot;(1985).Having stated my reservations concerning Berlin's interpretation of Hamann, I must say, however, that we can be grateful that he has helped mightily to rescue that German philosopher from the obscurity to which he has been unjustly relegated by those who remain under the spell of the strictly rationalistic wing of the Enlightenment. Berlin, in spite of his basic lack of empathy with Hamann, not only recognized his importance, but was always fascinated by him. He was an early and enthusiastic subscriber to &quot;The Hamann News-Letter,&quot; which I edited and published in the early 195O's and 196O's. Further, his correspondence with me regarding Hamann over a period of three and a half decades shows an unflagging interest in the man who both attracted and repelled him. In a letter to me of June 25,1972, he wrote: &quot;My passion for Hamann is undiminished.&quot; Not too surprisingly, there are certain passages in the present book in which Berlin seems, unwittingly, to move toward a certain degree of empathy,hence to a kind of &quot;verstehen.&quot; But such passages are few, and many others are unjustly harsh. Nevertheless, for all its shortcomings, Berlin's study of Hamann is valuable for introducing the reader, especially the anglophone reader, to the historically important pre-Romantic figure, known as &quot;The Magus of the North,&quot; without whom the development of German Romanticism would be unthinkable, and whose insights increasingly bear fruit today, especially in theology and philosophy. As Berlin has said: &quot;Hamann repays study.&quot;"},{"Title":"Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder","review":"Following that dictum, I might point out that, especially in two areas of contemporary concern, Hamann's thought is highly relevant: Oswald Bayer has shown in Autoritaet und Kritik (1991) that Hamann's hermeneutics -- antedating by two centuries Derrida's reflections on intertextuality -- provides the basis for a devastating critique of deconstruction by subverting the French thinker's concept of the &quot;center,&quot; and demonstrating where the true center (&quot;Mitte&quot;) is to be located. Further, there is presently a lively discussion among scholars of Hamann's critique of Kant's famous essay: &quot;What is Enlightenment&quot;? Berlin's present study would have done more justice to Hamann's thought by discussing such developments as these and others, which were available during his lifetime."},{"Title":"Collins Gem Beer Pb","review":"I was disappointed in the organization of this book, I found it difficult to find a specific beer.

It was published in six volumes in 1754, 1756, 1759, and 1761. This fourth volume covers the period of Queen Elizabeth from 1558 to 1602. The previous volume wasThe History of England, Volume III (History of England, The), and the next volume isThe History of England: From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688: Volume V.He begins with the statement, \\"In a nation so divided as the English, it could scarcely be expected, that the death of one sovereign, and the accession of another, who was generally believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which prevailed, could be the object of universal satisfaction: Yet so much were men displeased with the present conduct of affairs... that the people, overlooking their theological disputes, expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the scepter had passed into the hands of Elizabeth... compassion towards her situation, and concern for her safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favourite of the nation.\\" (Pg. 3-4)He asserts, \\"Of all the European churches, which shook off the yoke of papal authority, no one proceeded with so much reason and moderation as the church of England; an advantage... partly from the gradual and slow steps, by which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage and animosity against the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be supposed in such a revolution... The splendor of the Romish worship, though removed, had at least given place to order and decency... And the new religion, by mitigating the genius of the ancient superstition... had preserved itself in that happy medium, which wise men have always sought...\\" (Pg. 119-120)He observes, \\"During these years, while Europe was almost every where in great commotion, England enjoyed a profound tranquility; owing chiefly to the prudence and vigour of the queen's administration, and to the wise precautions, which she employed in all her measures.\\" (Pg. 176) He adds, \\"The queen had now brought affairs with Mary [I] to that situation... and had found a plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor... But she was restrained ... She foresaw the invidious colours, in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partizans of Mary, and... all foreign princes, perhaps with all posterity... Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed with the execution of the sentence...\\" (Pg. 236)Of Mary [I, \\"Queen of Scots\\"] he states, \\"a woman of great accomplishments both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one period, very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make her the most amiable of women... she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable, without relinquishing those soft graces, which compose the proper ornament of her sex.\\" (Pg. 251)He summarizes about Elizabeth, \\"The unusual length of her administration, and the strong features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices... Her vigour, her constancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed to merit the highest praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any person that ever filled a throne.... Her heroism was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice, her friendship from partiality, her active temper from turbulency and a vain ambition... but we are also apt to require some more softness of disposition, some greater leniency of temper, some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished... her qualities as a sovereign, though with some considerable exceptions, are the object of undisputed applause and approbation.\\" (Pg. 351-353)While Hume's scholarship has since been superseded, his lively writing style makes this a series well worth reading."},{"Title":"The history of England,: From the invasion of Julius Caesar to the revolution in 1688","review":"This is a review of the Liberty Press edition, which is properly typeset and should be distinguished from the numerous print-on-demand versions currently (2011) advertised.This is the fifth of six volumes of Hume's History of England, though it was the first published, as it is the first of the two volumes of the History of the Stuarts that was the first part to be completed. The first edition contained a remark summarising the theme as opposition to 'superstition and fanaticism', by which Hume meant Anglo-Catholicism and Puritanism. He was persuaded to remove this from later editions, but it summarises his 'plague on both their houses' approach to the conflict between King and Parliament of which the English Civil War and 'Glorious Revolution' are the best known parts. The Whig reply was John Millar'sHistorical View of the English Government.The book also has chapters on the development of literature and trade and is almost Shakespearian in the variety of characters who pass before us on the stage of Hume's imagination. Some argue that Hume's sympathies are too secular to do justice to such a religious epoch, but one certainly learns a lot on the way from his even-handedness. For example, I admired the Quaker's greeting the King as 'Friend Charles'. One point to bear in mind is that volumes five and six are a single story, so even if you start here you are in for a long, though rewarding read.

It prints the O.C.T, which is what most students are asked to read, explains the main differences between Ionic and Attic, and then proceeds to comment, clearly and unpretentiously, on all the useful linguistic information, explaining the Ionic dialect, difficult verb forms, tricky constructions etc. Herodotus is such a fascinating author that all scholars have wanted to do over the centuries is debate his historical methods, view of the cosmos, and argue about whether he is reliable or making the whole thing up. This has meant that for 2500 years those that reckon they can make their own mind up on those issues but would like some help just working through his Greek have been completely abandoned. How and Wells, the only English commentary on the whole of Herodotus, is a classic example of masses and masses of history but no linguistic information. But this commentary has filled the gap superbly. It has identified the real needs of the reader of Herodotus and has met them exactly. I found it incredibly useful when reading Herodotus 1 and I think others will too. I hope something similar is on the way for books 2-9."},{"Title":"Herodotus Book I","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this but when I got it, I found that it was all in Greek (even thought it said that it was all in english)."},{"Title":"Sell It Today, Sell It Now","review":"Another book from sales trainer Tom Hopkins, co-written with Pat Leiby. A nicely presented and easy to read text, warm, humourous and straight-forward to understand. Full of analogies and metaphors, good illustrations to go with them, lively reading throughout and well written. So why \\"disappointing\\"? I'll explain why. I have most of Tom's publications and tapes, and always like to obtain his new releases. I tried hard to obtain this book here in the UK but no-one had heard of it and so could not be ordered. Then I visited Amazon.com and discovered it was available via them. I purchased it and eagerly awaited its arrival (thanks Amazon for the speedy shipping even though it was at your standard rate. First Class service - Great!!). The book arrived and I keenly and enthusiastically jumped straight into it, dying to read the text to discover new techniques and ideas (descriptions of new ideas and techniques are mentioned in the text of the back-cover, inside-cover and preface). Oh-oh!! Not new ideas, techniques and skills. The material is repackaged from earlier publications by Tom Hopkins and was being used by myself and other salespersons back in the 80's to present day. In fact there are a number of more up-to-date techniques being employed. So what's going on then. Well, a lot of the material as I have already stated is repackaged from earlier works and also other sources. Some of the information comes from the field of NLP (widely used today) Most NLP techniques are just content-filled rhetoric (not really having the effects they claim, although some do - just sort the sensible claims and teachings from the silly). The social chart on different personality-types devised by Merrill and Reid are widely used by most today. Infact, the social chart of personality types has been used for quite some time (definitely 80's at least). For the sake of brevity, there are a lot of other books about sales training written by well-know authors and at less than half the price of this book that will give you just as much info if not more. I'm sure if you visit your local second-hand bookstore you'll be able to purchase one for coppers and that would contain similar content. If you don't have any previous books by Tom then go-ahead and purchase it, but if you have then most of the material in this book has been covered before. In short, don't waste your money on this book. I have been in sales most of my career and know what works and does not. The problem with the information in Tom's book is that a lot of the techniques described are already known by the buying public and business people alike (via consumer group authorities, publications, weekly publications, consumker guides, experience, etc.) They are aware of them (people are more educated today) and the more experienced can even \\"toy\\" with you during a sales presentation if you aren't careful how you use the techniques. Apart from reflexive, subconscious resistance, there is also conscious resistance, and this can be additionally due to awareness of certain selling techniques. I'm not saying these techniques don't work, they do, but have to be used discriminantly. There are newer skills available and a good search through the latest sales trainers will reveal them. I have a great respect for Tom Hopkins. His original book \\"How to Master the Art of Selling\\" was light years ahead of its time when first published. Tom is still one of the best sales trainers around and I'm sure he will continue to be so. His works are always lively, humourous, innovative, original and fresh. He is at the forefront of new skills and techniques. So come on Tom, next time be more original and inventive of new techniques.

One word of caution for fans of Hemingway-style economy of word: the plot moves along, but is frequently peppered with long explanations of ordinary things.The Key of the Book is Gunn's commentary on intellectualism. Community insiders, the local folk, seem to have a sixth sense about them. They are very comfortable with circumstances, even in the face of significant disruption in the community. The intellectuals among them -- mostly outsiders -- are constantly trying to think things through since they lack this local intuition. Two outsiders in particular blather on incessantly about the details of everything.

However, it would be helpful to read the other side of the story..."},{"Title":"The Esoteric Emerson: The Spiritual Teachings of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"So don't buy them both (as I see some shoppers have done). Here's what I wrote in my review of the later edition:Harold Bloom repeatedly names Ralph Waldo Emerson as the great theological architect of the &quot;American religion&quot; in his book of that title. However controversial some of Bloom's other theses may be, there is much truth in his characterization of the Sage of Concord. Probably most of us have been influenced by Emerson, at least indirectly, in far more ways than we realize.But reading Emerson directly is at once an enlightening and maddening experience: &quot;enlightening&quot; because Emerson was a philosopher in the best sense of the word -- a lover of wisdom -- and &quot;maddening&quot; because he was _not_ a philosopher in any _other_ sense of the word. He was stubbornly disinclined to argumentation or even systematic exposition; his essays read more like sermons than like philosophical arguments; he preferred to deliver himself of his oracular insights without, it seems, subjecting them either to the criticism of other minds or even to the rigors of critical self-reflection, on the view that Reason was an all but infallible source of insight into truth and its objects are known with the same immediacy with which we know that we are awake. (It is a curious view of reason which makes no allowances for improvement of one's understanding.)As a result of this take-it-or-leave it approach, his writings are all too easy to misunderstand, and for this he must bear much of the blame. For example, his remarks on charity in &quot;Self-reliance&quot; have led some readers to suppose that he was opposed to charity altogether, whereas in truth he believed that we are each of us suited by talent and temperament to be &quot;charitable&quot; to a special class of persons for whom we are therefore _truly_ responsible. Then, too, his remark in the same essay on &quot;a foolish consistency&quot; has been infamously and endlessly misquoted -- but even in its proper context it invites misunderstanding by failing to pay sufficient attention to the non-foolish variety of consistency (which Emerson supposed would take care of itself more or less automatically). Here again, Emerson's account of Reason, in giving so much weight to intuition, leaves strangely little room for reflection.But in my own opinion, at least, Emerson's insights are genuine, sometimes brilliant, and essentially right, and it would be a shame if the readers who needed him most were unable to profit from his writings merely because he had been needlessly obscure. It would be nice, then, to have from another writer the guidance that Emerson himself was unwilling or unable to provide.As you've probably guessed by now, that's where Richard Geldard comes in.In this volume (which is a revised edition of _The Esoteric Emerson_, so don't buy them both!) Geldard does a marvelous job of exposition. He knows his Emerson backwards and forwards, and he sets out the essential features of Emerson's thought in clear and orderly fashion, chapter by chapter.His essential &quot;take&quot; on Emerson, as you can tell from his title, is that Emerson is best approached as a spiritual teacher. I think this is not only correct but even obviously so; yet it is surprising how few available critical studies of Emerson are actually written from this point of view. At any rate, Geldard's exposition will provide the reader of Emerson with a much-needed &quot;map&quot; of the territory traversed in his writings.I suspect that Geldard's &quot;map&quot; will make Emerson available to many readers who might otherwise have found him unpalatable. Some readers may, for example, be put off by what seems to be Emerson's extraordinarily cavalier attitude toward tradition in favor of present experience.But according to Geldard, Emerson's actual meaning was as follows: &quot;We have to break, lovingly, the vessels of our tradition in order to become one with the source of that tradition&quot; [p. 176]. Now, certainly there is a difference in emphasis here with the religious tradition in which Emerson was brought up. But surely this is not far from, say, the Christian doctrine that the scriptures are a closed book unless read &quot;in the Spirit.&quot; (Granted, Emerson had much more in common with the Quakers than with the Calvinists in what he made of this point. Nevertheless it is not alien to even the most theologically conservative Christianity.)Not being a Christian myself, though, I am interested not primarily in reconciling Emerson with Christian theology but in simple exposition of his teaching. And Geldard excels in this regard: in ten straightforward chapters he sets out the essentials of Emerson's teaching and places it into the context of his life. Not bad for 177 pages of text.There are one or two points on which I wish Geldard had done a _little_ bit more explaining (for example, on the difference between the meanings of &quot;idealism&quot; in its philosophical and its popular senses), since he does not seem to be presuming any prior acquaintance with philosophy on the part of his readers. But this is just nitpicking on my part. (Hey, I have my own favorite hobby horses too.) This is a fine book and it will be of immense value to anyone who wants to understand what in the world Emerson was on about."},{"Title":"Writing a Romantic Novel: And Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"Buying how to books without being able to browse them is always a risky proposition. I thought though, that I had made a good choice with this Teach Yourself book, \`Writing a Romantic Novel and getting Published.' I am familiar with the Teach Yourself line of books and have always been impressed with their quality and this is a quality book. Just not what I thought that it would be.The author, Donna Baker is apparently a popular author in Britain, with Mill and Boons books, Harlequin if your in America, and she refers often to her own books, and other books from the same genre in this how to book. I do not want to write Harlequins and this book is written mainly for people who want to write a Harlequin romance. Unfortunatly that is not apparent with the fifty tag lines that are provided for the book.Ms. Baker spends the first couple chapters of the book justifying writing romance novels. Really, if I felt the need to justify wanting to write romances I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT A BOOK ON HOW TO WRITE THEM, Jeeze.Those points aside, it is a good how to write book in general and a good reference on how to write Harlequin romances. I guess what I really did not like was her constant self-promotion. Writing a Romantic Novel has so much personal information about Ms. Baker that it is as much a book for fans of her other books as it is a how to book.It takes the novice author from the beginning when one creates the characters to the end getting it to the publishers in a clear and concise manner. It is for the would be author of shorter 55,000 to 60,000 word romance's. However, her admittedly good writing advice can be found in a Readers Digest, \`how to write', book. If you just want to get started on a novel go ahead and browse those.

Norris writes a historical / romance book in which Laura Dearborn finds herself in Chicago from Boston. Almost immediately, she is beset by a variety of suitors. However, she is most taken by Curtis Jadwin, a sophisticated businessman who is influential on the Chicago Board of Trade.After marrying Laura, the conservative speculator, after making a nice profit on the wheat market, becomes obsessive over controlling it. As the story unfolds, his wealth grows in a short period of time and for a while he captures the market. Ultimately, though, the market corrects itself and he must save his fortune as well as his wife, Laura, whose love begins to flee from lack of attention from Jadwin.I found this book very slow at the beginning. However, once the market traps Jadwin, the book becomes exciting and the pages fly by. Laura is a realistic character, although I didn't have a lot of sympathy for her - she come off rather spoiled and hapless. Norris's point about the addictiveness of speculating on wheat futures and the power that it has over the rest of the world is evident. A solid book and worth reading by those who like that period of time or are interested in Chicago's history."},{"Title":"Pit: A Story of Chicago","review":"The second novel in an unfinished trilogy (THE OCTOPUS was the initial volume), it's the story of how a man's ruthless business ambitions drive a wedge between himself and the love of his wife. Curtis Jadwin speculates in the Chicago wheat market; his successes propel him into wanting to \\"corner the market,\\" which he proceeds to do. In the wake of all that \\"desire of the moth for the star,\\" as Shelley put it, is the detritus of ruined men committing suicide, failed health, and Jadwin's own crumbling marriage due to neglect. Indeed, his wife Laura almost succumbs to the attentions of another man, Sheldon Corthell, but is brought back to her husband's side when he becomes ill. The scenes with Laura are the least successful because they are the most melodramatic. Norris felt the need, of course, to put things on an even keel again before the story's close; thus Jadwin loses all his money on a poor gamble regarding a banner wheat harvest that sends the market reeling, which brings on his illness and the loyal Laura. All's well that ends well, as the couple head West to start a new, though financially poorer, life (in 1903 it was still possible to do that). Norris is at his best in the wheeling and dealing that occurs in the Chicago exchange: the writing there is exciting and crisp. This tale of greed vs. marital love is a good one, though not as powerful as THE OCTOPUS."},{"Title":"Pit: A Story of Chicago","review":"\\"The Pit: A Story of Chicago\\" was the second novel in Frank Norris's projected trilogy \\"The Epic of the Wheat\\", \\"The Octopus\\" being the first. In the event, however, Norris died suddenly in October 1902 leaving the third installment, provisionally titled \\"The Wolf\\", unwritten.\\"The Pit\\" is in many ways a very different book from its predecessor. It is much shorter, being only just over half the length of \\"The Octopus\\". Whereas \\"The Octopus\\" was mostly rural in its setting, \\"The Pit\\" is entirely urban, with the whole of the action taking place in Chicago. \\"The Octopus\\" did not have a single protagonist, with several characters, all male, taking the leading role at different stages of the book. \\"The Pit\\", by contrast, concentrates on the fortunes of a single married couple, the wealthy businessman Curtis Jadwin and his wife Laura. What the two novels have in common, apart from the theme of wheat, is Norris's socialist world view and his critical attitude towards what he saw as capitalist greed.In \\"The Octopus\\", capitalism is represented by the powerful railroad company which ruthlessly uses its monopoly on transport to exploit the Californian wheat growers. In \\"The Pit\\" Norris's target is the commodity dealers at the Chicago Board of Trade, who can make or lose immense fortunes by speculating on the price of wheat and other commodities. The title \\"The Pit\\" refers to the trading floor of the Board of Trade, but in biblical language it can also be a synonym for Hell or the grave, as in Psalm 88. (\\"I am counted with them that go down into the Pit\\"). The dealers generally have little or no regard to the hardship which they inflict on others. The \\"Bears\\", who manipulate the market by artificially depressing the price of wheat, inflict hardship on American farmers. The \\"Bulls\\", who manipulate the market by artificially inflating the price, inflict hardship on the poor in those European countries which depend upon imports of American wheat; on the commodity exchange, unlike the stock market, a \\"bull market\\" is not necessarily a sign of economic prosperity. (If Norris is to be believed, Americans themselves at this period consumed more potatoes than bread).Jadwin has initially made his fortune in property, but soon, like many other wealthy men in Chicago, becomes involved with wheat speculation, which he sees as a quick and easy way to make money. He does so not because he is in need of money- his property business already brings him enough income to allow him to live in considerable luxury- but because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of making money for its own sake and because he enjoys the sense of power which being a successful speculator allows him. The note on the back of this edition describes Laura as his \\"brutally abused\\" wife, a description which strikes me as inaccurate. Jadwin is not guilty of physical violence towards Laura, or even deliberate emotional cruelty. His one great fault as a husband is that he becomes so obsessed with speculating that he neglects everything else, even his beautiful young wife.In \\"The Octopus\\" Norris's writing shows the influence of Emile Zola, but in \\"The Pit\\" it also shows the influence of another French writer, Flaubert, especially in the treatment of Laura Jadwin, who shares many traits with the heroine of \\"Madame Bovary\\". Like Emma Bovary, Laura is a born romantic, with a very romanticised view of love, and like Emma can also be impulsive and fickle. (Unlike Emma, however, she is never physically unfaithful to her husband, although she is sorely tempted). Much of the early part of the novel deals with the courtship of Jadwin and Laura, who also has two other suitors for her hand. One of these, Landry Court who eventually marries Laura's sister Page, is a fairly minor character, but the other, a young artist named Sheldon Corthell, plays a more important role. In many ways Corthell would seem to be the ideal soul-mate for Laura, with whom he is deeply in love, as the two have many interests in common, and yet he fails to win her because, paradoxically, the two are so similar. Laura is not looking for a soul-mate but rather for a man who is the exact opposite of herself, someone strong and forceful whom she can look up to and admire. She has little interest in business itself, but sees in the dynamic businessman Jadwin the strong man whom she has been seeking, even though she is unsure whether she loves him. The opposition of commerce (represented by Jadwin) and of art (represented by Corthell) is one of the major themes of the book, with the former being seen as something \\"masculine\\" and the latter as something \\"feminine\\".Norris is sometimes described as a \\"naturalist\\" writer, but \\"The Pit\\" is not a \\"naturalist\\" novel, if by that term is meant a novel which deals with the darker side of human life, poverty, vice and crime. All the main characters are from the wealthy or well-to-do classes, and their actions, although often immoral, never stray into the criminal. As Professor Joseph McElrath points out in his introduction, Norris did not, unlike some naturalist writers, take a purely deterministic view of human nature. Rather, his is a moral universe where his characters have moral choices open to them. It is this idea of moral choice which unites the two sides of the novel, the public and the private, into a coherent whole. The two are linked by the theme of selfishness; Jadwin is driven by ruthless self-interest both in pursuit of his business aims and in his treatment of Laura (although it must be admitted that she can on occasions be just as self-centred as her husband). The book's irony is that Jadwin's ruthlessness proves to be his undoing as he finds himself unable to control the economic forces he has set in motion; believing that he can corner the wheat market, he ultimately finds that the wheat has cornered him.I preferred \\"The Pit\\" to \\"The Octopus\\", which contains some powerful writing but suffers from a less coherent structure and an overly optimistic ending. Certainly, in some respects, especially its attitude towards the role of women in society, \\"The Pit\\" is very much a novel of its time. In other respects, however, it has a great deal of relevance to modern society. Men like Curtis Jadwin are as much a part of the capitalist system today as they were a hundred years ago; he has much in common with the villain of a twenty-first century novel, John Veals in Sebastian Faulks's \\"A Week in December\\". Apart from its analysis of greed, the book also contains a fine analysis of a failing marriage, worthy in this respect to rank alongside the likes of \\"Madame Bovary\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\"."},{"Title":"Pit: A Story of Chicago","review":"This is a classic novel about ego, business and financial speculation. Its about the rise of a grain trader in Chicago who gradually gets \\"bigger\\" in the business until he finally attempts to \\"corner\\" the market. The best part about the novel is how timeless it is. The observations about the practicalities of fighting the market, the realities of \\"business journalism\\", the mentality which allows these people to be unaware of the consequences of their actions and the whole lifestyle of those involved are still as true today as they were when the book was written.Norris tells the story in an evenhanded way and presents an accurate picture of the major characters rather than using them as political sockpuppets. As he did with the farmers in \\"the Octopus\\", he gives the characters a complexity in that they can be both sympathetic victims and exploiters. One of the high points for me is how he shows the bubble world of the traders while at the same time, showing the effects their actions are having in the real world and how divorced they are from the consquences of their actions.The book is also the story of a relationship and a marriage. That story is often interesting in and of itself. But at times it seems like \\"filler\\" in what would have otherwise been a small book.The best part of the book is the final confrontation in \\"the pit\\". Its a dramatic ending worthy of the story and makes the very clear point that ultimately the market cannot be controlled by any individual for long."},{"Title":"Pit: A Story of Chicago","review":"Except for the language and gender roles, which date this book from its publication in 1902, The Pit could have been written about any form of speculation to which greedy executives have succumbed. The Pit happens to be about the speculation in wheat at the turn of the last century, which is appropriate given the agrarian nature of the American economy at that time. However, you could exchange any number of commodities for wheat in this story - oil, mortgages, stocks, dot-coms, and you would see the very timely similarities.Curtis Ladwin is a man who already has more money than he could ever use or need, but he's addicted to the art of the deal, and thrill of thinking two steps ahead of his competitors. To the detriment of his health, his family and his finances, he continues to chase long after the tide has turned. \\"I haven't cornered the wheat. The wheat has cornered me.\\"Frank Norris is one of my favorite novelists from this time period because his stories are still amazingly readable and relevant. Some authors from the early 1900s are almost impossible to read now, so ridden are their books with linguistic acrobatics. Aside from some melodramatic histrionics in the domestic scenes, the language that Norris uses is remarkably plain-spoken and contemporary in feel.I've only reduced the book from five stars to four because I believe it is melodramatic in the domestic scenes. I understand that these over-the-top dramatics are commonplace in novels from this period, but I have seen domestic scenes of this type written better, and I know that Frank Norris was capable of a lighter touch."},{"Title":"Pit: A Story of Chicago","review":"\`The Pit' is a story of speculation on the price of wheat in the Chicago wheat exchange (the \`Pit') at a moment when agriculture was the main industry in the world.As Frank Norris tells us: speculation \`is a matter of life and death', not for the speculators (\`the fellows in the Pit don't care about the grain'), but for the farmers and the world population, because the speculators \`say just how much the peasant shall pay for his loaf of bread. If he can't pay the price, he simply starves.'The price is also vital for the world economy: \`Because of some sudden eddy spinning outward in the middle of the Pit's turmoil, a dozen bourses of continental Europe clamored with panic, a dozen Old-World banks trembled.'An \`Unknown Bull' succeeds in cornering the wheat market sending the price to dizzying heights.

She also chooses the speculator, \`always cruel, selfish, pitiless, the fighter, rigorous, panoplied in the harness of the warrior', instead of the artist \`and his cult of the beautiful, soft of hand and speech, refined, sensitive and temperamental.'This novel, whose subject is still very topical, is sometimes not without a certain sentimentality and theatricality.

Laura Jadwin, nee Dearborn, tells most of the story. Her inner conflict between self-centered materialism and desire for \\"perfect\\" love forms the backdrop to the financial saga enmeshing her husband, Curtis.

She started \\"The Color of Money\\" column in March 1997. In 2003, she published her first book, 7 Money Mantras For A Richer Life: How To Live Well With The Money You Have. The paperback of the book was retitled, Spend Well, Live Rich. Her second book, Your Money and Your Man: How You and Prince Charming Can Spend Well and Live Rich, was released Jan. 31, 2006, both published by Random House.As always, I found Michelle Singletary's writing style pleasant to read and easy to understand. If the reader has little or no prior knowledge of finances, especially with regards to marriage, than this might be a good first start. However, if the reader already has a library of basic financial books, this one is a little redundant.In this her third book, she divided her advice into sections that help at different stages: dating, marriage, when children arrive, divorce)--and learning to talk about money with someone you intend to marry--and finding your \\"money compatibility.\\" Fighting over money is still the number one problem in most marriages.I did find her decade-by-decade list of money milestones to be very interesting and useful. Be aware that this book is filled with Bible quotes and is very conservative. For instance, Singletary suggests that having separate bank accounts is leaving a way out of marriage--instead of simply stating the pros and cons of separate vs. combined incomes.This is a wide-ranging book, covering everything from dating, planning the wedding, marriage, children, straight through to divorce or separation. Unfortunately, there was nothing in this book that I hadn't read in several other books, with the exception of the money milestones, which while not new, were put together in an interesting way.In conclusion, if you are looking for a basic book of finances for those with a conservative, religious point-of-view who are considering or newly married, this book might be helpful.

While she provides decent relationship advice (talk about money early on, consider whether the person you are dating has compatible and desireable money management skills), the financial advice is at times questionable or flat-out wrong based on a number of other experts and common sense. For example, she advocates using a bank savings account for keeping 3-6 months worth of expenses for emergencies while most experts I've consulted in the past suggest a money market account which is equally liquid and provides a much better interest rate.This book may be more helpful to people who are total novices in money management (although I think Personal Finance for Dummies or similar books provide beter general advice) or those who have significant debt.

And, that was all within the first 20 pages!What does any of that have to do with financial tips and advice?!"},{"Title":"Your Money and Your Man: How You and Prince Charming Can Spend Well and Live Rich","review":"If you're a right wing Christian, and a money novice, you'll probably love this book. However, I wish I'd spent my money on a different couples' finance book.Don't be fooled by the hip title and cool cover. There are a few nuggets of decent financial advice in here, but you have to wade through Singletary's Dark Ages social-conservative propaganda and Bible verses to get to it, and it's really annoying if you're not so inclined.Even more troublesome is the fact that some of her money advice seems to be based on her right-wing \\"values\\" rather than on sound financial reasoning. (For example, I learned from Michelle's book that couples who maintain separate checking accounts are just keeping open an easy \\"out\\" for a future divorce.

Liturgy is, after all, one of the primary ways in which most people feel a connection to God. When dealing with a church has heavily invested in liturgy as the Anglican church (in America, the official incarnation is the Episcopal Church, with various unofficial/non-official tributaries to the main stream), changing the liturgy is tantamount to changing the world. Thus it is with great care and deliberation that liturgical renovations and innovations are introduced, and even more care and concern is given to wholesale reworkings, as happened with the \`new' Book of Common Prayer made official in 1979.Michael Moriarty looks at the history of the development of the latest American Book of Common Prayer with a particular focus on the group called Associated Parishes, formed in the years after World War II by a dozen priests who were concerned about the connection and relevance of liturgy to \`regular' life. Moriarty's first chapter deals with the situation in which this group arose - the Book of Common Prayer at that time was the 1928, itself a revision of the 1892, etc. These prayerbooks had various strengths and weaknesses, but like any well-established liturgy, they each had strong advocates who resisted change to the extent of leaving the official church to preserve their liturgy. There was a joke circulating around the time of the adoption of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer in which someone said of those threatening to leave to remain faithful to the 1928 Prayer Book, \`I don't know what they are so concerned about, because everybody knows the \\"real\\" prayer book was the 1892.'In actual fact, liturgical reform and renewal had been a growing idea even before the war; this ended up being true after the 1979 book's introduction, that people immediately set about thinking of ways to \`improve' it. Moriarty explores the issues, personalities and wider contexts of the movements to update the 1928 Prayer Book, describing the initial impulses of the Associated Parishes' leadership as a sort of \`divine discontent'. This liturgical process did not work in a vacuum, as indeed Anglican and non-Anglican churches were going through similar issues around the world. The American Roman Catholic liturgical discussions in some ways paralleled the Episcopal ones, as Moriarty points out, and there were divergences between various Anglican communion churches.Even as Moriarty focuses primarily on the role of the Associated Parishes and the generation's length work done by that group toward Prayer Book revision, he acknowledges that this task was beyond the control or direction of any particular group. The only way for this kind of enterprise to be successful is for it to be taken on board by the wider community, which happened here, and Associated Parishes was a key player. Moriarty points out that the success of this group was not so much in getting particular pieces or turns of phrase into the new Book of Common Prayer, but rather in serving as a catalyst for change, in addition to the various scholars and other cultural aspects that made this possible.Moriarty sees the 1979 Book of Common Prayer as being part of the \`survival kit' of the church in a post-Christendom world, one that more adequately fits the more modern idea of things religious being a \`window' (Rahner) than a \`mirror' (Aquinas), showing where God is."},{"Title":"Beyond the Box: Innovative Churches That Work","review":"Great book for helping use your church to expand God's reach in the world. Easy to read; interesting. Great price from Amazon."},{"Title":"Beyond the Box: Innovative Churches That Work","review":"The brief book is a real gem for those looking for ideas on how to best do church in a changing culture. I am the pastor of a young church in New York City and we studied this book as a team. The chapters are brief, tied directly to local churches who are doing it and full of in your face questions to get you thinking. The chapters on 'team teaching' and 'church the city' (vs. being one church in a city) were very challenging. My only complaint - the analysis was too brief.If you are a pastor or on staff of a new church, my advice: Buy this book, read it with your staff, follow the web links and send Dave Travis a donation so he will keep doing this research for us!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Box: Innovative Churches That Work","review":"My questions below relate to items I believe need further explanation in light of the claims made in the book. The authors present nine categories claimed to present \`clutter' or \`box baggage' for modern churches. These are the things the authors believe should be left behind in order to embrace \`innovation'....1. Hierarchy - What does a hierarchy-free church look like? Would elders/deacons constitute hierarchy?2. Structure/Organization - What is a modern day example of an effective, unorganized worship service?3. Property/Location - Which contemporary churches exist with no property or location?4. Conflict - Not sure what this means.5. Centralized Control - If there is no \`centralized control' does this mean there is no headship?6. Ordination - Is ordination when a church body examines a person's beliefs and qualifications for ministry in light of scripture?7. Clergy - As far as I know there are no clergy-free churches in my area. This one is difficult to imagine.8. Seminaries - I guess this one is self-evident. If there is no ordination, control, or clergy there would be no need for seminaries.9. Denominations - Is to abandon denominations the same as abandoning doctrinal statements? If so, what would differentiate churches if not their core beliefs?What does it mean for the church to \`move forward'? Is innovation simply moving away from the things the church has always done? What are the foundational elements of the church, which if left behind would leave the church with no real effect? I wish the authors had attempted to identify those things which can and should never change."},{"Title":"A white water handbook for canoe and kayak","review":"This slender volume is approaching 50 years since publication, yet still provides concise instruction on whitewater boating technique.

I am writing this now mainly for those of you who have heard of Garcia Marquez but have not yet read any of his work. My advice is to start with Love in the Time of Cholera. It is also a poetic, mystical, and romantic story but with essentially three major characters it is much easier to follow. Then read Chronicle of a Death Foretold. When those two have sparked you then take on One Hundred Years of Solitude!

First: It omited the explanation on the banana plantation. The walking through the banana plantation was a supernatural walk because when a person was close to another person, they had to shout at each other to be able to hear; on the other hand, if they were standing about one hundred yards from each other, one of the persons could whispered anything and the other person could hear what he/she said as if that person was next to him/her. For that reason everybody wanted to take a walk through the plantation.

Michener focuses on several cities in Spain, but most of the time these are mere settings for his fascinating discourses on the history, culture and politics of a country he obviously has long been attached to. DO NOT make the mistake I did of reading just the parts that coincided with our trip--every chapter is fascinating, and now I find I'm going back and reading the parts I skipped the first time.To call this book outdated is a bit silly--it was published in 1968 and represents a highly intelligent and well-informed look at Spain at that time, as Franco's power was waning. If he were alive today I think Michener would have been pleased. Things have turned out far better than he thought they would; he was skeptical that a two-party democracy would ever work in Spain.I've read much of Michener's fiction but now that I've read this, I wonder if he missed his true calling. The fiction is a good way to get a feel for a place, but I know people who advise skipping the first hundred pages, and skimming through the rest. Of course this book is long too, but quite different--I read 600 of the 900 pages in 2 days--it's that good.I can't recommend this strongly enough--by now the info on tapas bars is long outdated, but for a quirky, personal, well-informed view of Spain on the eve of democracy, I doubt you'll do better."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"IBERIA is non-fiction memoir of Michener's experiences in Spain. I read the book before I went to Spain and found that Michener was right. He said Spain haunts people who go there. I've been all over the world and Spain is the only place that haunts me in a delicious way.Spain likely was the heart and soul of Imperial Rome.IBERIA is a splendid tale about a splendid place."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Although \\"Iberia\\" was originally published in 1968 (and spent the next seven months on the \\"New York Times\\" best seller list), we used it eleven years later to plan our first trip to Spain. It had not gone out-of-date. If it had aged at all, it was in Michener's less-than-balanced account of the Spanish Civil War (of course the same could be said of Hemingway).\\"Iberia\\" is a massive, thousand-page love affair with Spain, part history, part travelogue, and part parador-and-tapa-bar guide. It is not \`merely' a tour guide to Spain, any more than Rebecca West's \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is \`merely' a tour guide to Yugoslavia. With the possible exception of his Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\", I believe this to be Michener's finest work.My opinion (or prejudice) is based on our unforgettable journey through Spain. Michener took us places we never would have found in the standard tourist guides. We pigged out in his tapa bars-\\"first comes the seafood--- the anchovies, eel, squid, octopus, herring, shrimp, salmon, five kinds of sardines, five kinds of fish; next come the boiled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, potato omelets cut in strips, vegetables, onions, salads; third are the cold meats in great variety, including meat balls, York ham, Serran ham, tripe, brains, liver in a variety of styles, beef, pork and veal; and finally the hot dishes...\\"I booked us into many of the paradors that he recommended. Paradors are combination hotel-museums, which serve some of the best food in Spain---\\"Where practical, the paradors are housed in ancient buildings, such as old convents, monasteries, castles no longer in use, hospitals dating back to the age of the Catholic Kings, or inns in which Columbus may have slept.\\"In Merida, we stayed in a parador that is housed in the 500-year-old Convento de los Frailes de Jesus (Michener's personal favorite). Then there was the castle-parador, the parador that is built within the Alhambra, and the modern, ski-resort parador on the slopes of Monte Perdido. We stumbled across the last-mentioned resort while lost in the Pyrenees, and had it literally to ourselves (and one other couple), since the season was late spring.My one regret is that we did not get to attend the ancient horse fair that follows Holy Week in Seville, and is so lovingly described in \\"Iberia.\\" This fair dates back \\"two thousand years to the days when Romans came here to buy horses for their generals...If a man likes horses, this rough-and-ready market with no rules and little order would delight him. It is conducted under a blazing sun and has about it a strange and ancient quality. I have attended at three different times and found it difficult to believe that I was in the twentieth century...\\"If you are planning a trip to Spain, book yourself into the paradors well in advance of your trip (at least a year in advance if you plan to visit during or immediately after Holy Week), try to attend Seville's ancient horse fair, and above all, buy and read Michener's \\"Iberia.\\""},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"I've never been to Spain, but after reading Michener's mammoth work on the country, I wish I had gone long ago. I have this sneaking feeling that the place has changed out of all recognition since he published this 795 page tome in 1968. Perhaps it has become more like the rest of Europe or even more like the rest of the world than it was during the latter part of Franco's long rule. Is it still \\"Spanish\\", whatever that may mean ? Maybe, but not the same way. I'm sure I've missed that old Spain of Franco's time and maybe (also) that's not such a bad thing. What role bullfighting and flamenco play in contemporary Spain is probably open to question. Does the Catholic church have the same power that it did ? Does it still have power over the schools ? Certainly censorship has disappeared and we see any number of modern films, full of sex, from the once \\"protected\\" society. Prices have increased, poverty diminished, the cities have grown and the countryside been drained of people. Spain is now indubitably a land to which immigrants come, not one from which they go. All big changes in the last 40 years. So, you might ask, why should I bother to read an out-of-date book like this ?You should read this book if you're going to Spain. Sure, it's not about the society you're going to see, but it's about the recent past there. It tells you a thousand things you could still see, you could find, taste, experience. You might be interested to know what things used to be like if you've already been to Spain in the last 20 years. You should read it as an intense portrait---warts and all---of a particular country, a country that has played a major role in world and European history. What you will get from this superb book is a flavor, whether your taste runs to social analysis, history, architecture, bullfighting, people, nature, or just simple travel. It's one of the great travel books of the English language, not, by the way, one of Michener's eventually rather formulaic, boring novels. Even if his political predictions and those of the Spaniards he interviewed were often off base seen in hindsight, he deals with all the issues--the landowners, the church, the Guardia Civil, the economy, Catalan and Basque separatism, the arts, and the general ability to rule and be ruled. The style is extremely readable, the photographs by Robert Vavra, outstanding, the maps satisfying. Read the other reviews of IBERIA. You'll see I'm not just whistling Dixie here.

The writer's vast knowledge on Spain is told in an interesting manner which includes conversations with Spaniards of all backgrounds. He covers everything from Spanish art to betting on soccer matches."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Bought this book for reading while on a recent trip to spain. Ive lived there on and off for a long time, and was hoping that Michener would paint a picture that would add to my trip, and my love of the area.Warning- this is NOT a typical michener book. This is a personal travelogue, and has nothing to do with the other novels we all love- Chesepeake, Alaska, etc. As a travelogue, it shows Michener not as the compassionate individual we would all come to expect, but as a whiny, sexist, individual I would NEVER want to have dinner with, let along travel in Spain with.This book mostly features Michener whining about how Spain does not live up to his mythical image of what it should be. He complains that the flamenco is not genuine enough. That the mosques are despoiled. The only way this book is interesting is as a period piece- not about spain, but about american paternalistic, patronizing, and generally obnoxious attitudes when it was written.I was hoping this book would make me love spain more deeply, and become more interested in Michener as an individual. It did the exact oppostite. Luckily I know enough about spain to see through it. If you do want a book to make you love Spain, and with a genuine warmth for the people who live there, I like \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" by Hemmingway."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"My husband and I toured Spain last year and besides the normal travel guide books, reading the history of the Iberian peninsula added so much to our trip."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"No question, Michener is a great observer of Spain and he has introduced me to so many ideas and intrigues about Spain, I must give him the highest marks! In short, if you are serious about understanding Spain, this book is a must.However, I do have a nagging complaint. As a woman, I found the book overwhelmingly geared to the masculine reader. Although I do love his ornate descriptions of men, the absence of any equivalent descriptions of women was a source of great disappointment. Where a woman receives a passing comment, descriptions of men take up major portions of chapters and are referred to again and again. I think his wife was mentioned in a line or two in the chapter about Barcelona. He does recount history with respect to Spain's great ladies, but in terms of intimate passages about human beings he met, it is all about men. He describes them in great detail!In my opinion, this book represents half the story; another one about the women of Spain and the intimate details of their perspective is perhaps still yet to come."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Many years ago I had a copy of Mitchner's Iberia but no more and as I'm going once again to Spain soon I wanted to review some of what he wrote.

The history up until that time, however, plus the essence of Spanish culture and traditions which Michener observed, have changed little. I bought the hardback, with the beautiful reproductions of Robert Vavra's photographs, when it first reached the bookstores and have read it in its entirety several times. In addition, I have taken sections of a paperback copy with me on more than a dozen trips I've made to Spain since then. The beauty of the book is that the chapters can be read independently of each other. For that reason I took the paperback apart, stapled the pages of each chapter together, and carry only those pertaining to the places I will visit. (I travel light). Even though I've been several times to the southwestern part of Spain where I'll spend most of the time on my next trip, I, once again, will take the packets pertaining to that region. The pages are so worn and marked up, however, I am purchasing another copy."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"For me, the most arresting page of this very gripping series of Spanish impressions over three decades wasn't one with text on in at all; it was a photograph of a wrinkled old woman staring at us through a screen of metal mesh. Her eyes alight, her lips pursed, she has a singularly engaged expression on her age-coarsened face. Is she smiling? Is she scowling? I don't know, but I keep looking at her trying to figure it out.She sums up the beauty and mystery of this great book. James Michener first visited Spain in 1932, already knowing the language and much of the culture through his time in Latin America. The place drew him from reading about it, and once there he became a kind of patron of Spain, bleeding with it from a distance through its Civil War and trying to make sense of contrary impressions through subsequent visits to its many varied parts. \\"Iberia\\" is a long book, but it is not a chore to read as Michener bounces around geographically and thematically to discuss the nation's art, sports, history, wildlife, culture, and most especially its people in diverse and pleasing ways.\\"Iberia\\" is not a book about the entire Iberian peninsula; it just feels like one when you pick it up. Michener does offer some thoughts on Portugal, though nothing on little Andorra, Iberia's third nation. It doesn't even cover all of Spain, but what you do get of it is satisfying. The book was written and apparently much researched in the mid-1960s, making it a bit of a time capsule already by the time of its 1968 publication and more so today.\\"Spain is known as a man's country, but the women of Spain seem not to have been informed of this fact,\\" he notes at one point.Michener's takes on Spanish life may not be argument-proof, but that is part of their beauty. This is a book that takes you along, but never pushes you in any particular direction. He presents everything in a way that might be called \\"objective impressionism,\\" communicating his sources of passion for the country but leaving final judgments to the reader.I was fascinated by his descriptions of Spain's artistic wealth, which Michener writes of with both grace and gusto. The towers of Barcelona's famous Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia cathedral are like \\"pretzel sticks studded with salt crystals, except that at the upper end they narrowed down to points of rock candy, brilliantly colored.\\" An El Greco painting of \\"flaming red...leads the eye to colors no other artist would dare place in juxtaposition, just as no sensible man laying out the history of a nation would dare give one country the contradictory experiences that Spain has known.\\"The myriad of people Michener meets in his Spanish travels, from all walks of life, are frequently engaging and often delightful. A guide at Toro Michener finds \\"remarkable both for his information and for his trousers, which had to be ample to cover his girth but which also came nearly to his chin.\\" The mayor of one Galician town tears up at the memory of the poet Rosal&iacute;a de Castro, who lived her life with an intensity for her home province \\"that most human beings never know.\\"The only chapters I found dry reading at times were those on Pamplona and on bullfighting, both of which seem to present Michener at his more sententious regarding the taurine sport that defined Spain then and still does somewhat today. He seems at pains to acknowledge the legacy of that other American visitor, Ernest Hemingway (about whom Michener seems not as enamored as he might wish to be) as well as a number of other foreigners who offer their own, much more starkly opinionated takes on Spain. In the process, you are reminded why Michener is so much more preferable when interacting with Spain on his own.Otherwise, this is a great book from start to finish, enlivened by the photography of Michener's collaborator, Robert Vavra, who took that enigmatic photo of the old lady and many others which are just as good. There's much to love in Michener's \\"Iberia,\\" either as a cover-to-cover read or as something to dip into again and again like tapas on a hot Andaluc&iacute;an night."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"\\"Iberia\\" is an amazing book. I can't believe that a person could research and write this book and get anything else done in one lifetime. It is a great book to read immediately before or immediately after a trip to Spain. Michener's enthusiasm for his subject is quite evident as he discusses nearly every imaginable aspect of Spain.Make no mistake, this book represents a reading challenge. In the paperback version it is over 900 pages long and covers such a wide variety of subjects related to Spain that there is probably something to interest most readers. However, there is probably something to bore most readers as well.I enjoyed Michener's personal travel anecdotes and his reviews of European history the most. Michener's reviews of paintings and sculptures go on at great length at times, but would probably be fantastic for someone who is more of an art aficionado than I.The book was published in 1968 so it is a bit dated, but it is still a great review of all things pertaining to Spain."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Written over a period of 30 years, this is really a timeless piece of work about how Spain shaped Michener, the young man and later, the successful writer. Of course, other writers and artists have also influenced by Spain, such as Earnest Hemmingway and Orson Wells. But few books about Spain provide a deeper understanding and appreciation of the country's history, under Islam and Christiandom, as well as it political and modern day pace of life."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Written in 1968 this is a non-fictional account of James Michener's travels throughout Spain during his lifetime. He includes much history, local culture, tradition, and insight into this somewhat enigmatic country. Still relevant, but if you'd like to complement this book with a more recent follow-up, I would suggest Ghosts of Spain by Giles Tremlett, but first read Michener if you want to get some great comprehensive background. The two in fact complement each other."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"We are taking a trip to Spain and Portugal in May-June and I want to read this book before we go. It arrived before the expected delivery date and in excellent condition!"},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Unlike Michener's other works, Iberia is a personal reflection on many years of travel in Spain in the 50s and 60s. His in-depth descriptions of the history associated with the places he visits should prove to be an excellent context for a visit to Spain."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"\\"Iberia\\" by Michener was an amazing read. This is not a fictional writing, this is his views and experiences in Spain, with a lot of history and culture mixed in. Add to that some really nice black & white photography. It is a rather lengthy book, but it's all good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"For my hundredth review, I wanted to describe a book that meant something very special to my husband and me. Although &quot;Iberia&quot; was originally published in 1968 (and spent the next seven months on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list), we used it eleven years later to plan our first trip to Spain. It had not gone out-of-date. If it had aged at all, it was in Michener's less-than-balanced account of the Spanish Civil War (of course the same could be said of Hemingway).&quot;Iberia&quot; is a massive, thousand-page love affair with Spain, part history, part travelogue, and part parador-and-tapa-bar guide. It is not 'merely' a tour guide to Spain, any more than Rebecca West's &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; is 'merely' a tour guide to Yugoslavia. With the possible exception of his Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, I believe this to be Michener's finest work.My opinion (or prejudice) is based on our unforgettable journey through Spain. Michener took us places we never would have found in the standard tourist guides. We pigged out in his tapa bars-&quot;first comes the seafood--- the anchovies, eel, squid, octopus, herring, shrimp, salmon, five kinds of sardines, five kinds of fish; next come the boiled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, potato omelets cut in strips, vegetables, onions, salads; third are the cold meats in great variety, including meat balls, York ham, Serran ham, tripe, brains, liver in a variety of styles, beef, pork and veal; and finally the hot dishes...&quot;I booked us into many of the paradors that he recommended. Paradors are combination hotel-museums, which serve some of the best food in Spain---&quot;Where practical, the paradors are housed in ancient buildings, such as old convents, monasteries, castles no longer in use, hospitals dating back to the age of the Catholic Kings, or inns in which Columbus may have slept.&quot;In Merida, we stayed in a parador that is housed in the 500-year-old Convento de los Frailes de Jesus (Michener's personal favorite). Then there was the castle-parador, the parador that is built within the Alhambra, and the modern, ski-resort parador on the slopes of Monte Perdido. We stumbled across the last-mentioned resort while lost in the Pyrenees, and had it literally to ourselves (and one other couple), since the season was late spring.My one regret is that we did not get to attend the ancient horse fair that follows Holy Week in Seville, and is so lovingly described in &quot;Iberia.&quot; This fair dates back &quot;two thousand years to the days when Romans came here to buy horses for their generals...If a man likes horses, this rough-and-ready market with no rules and little order would delight him. It is conducted under a blazing sun and has about it a strange and ancient quality. I have attended at three different times and found it difficult to believe that I was in the twentieth century...&quot;If you are planning a trip to Spain, book yourself into the paradors well in advance of your trip (at least a year in advance if you plan to visit during or immediately after Holy Week), try to attend Seville's ancient horse fair, and above all, buy and read Michener's &quot;Iberia.&quot;"},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"This book is long but entertaining. The visualization of the land is accurate. I would recommend it only to people who enjoy long and detailed descriptions. The contrasts of the land and people are astonishing"},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"I really wanted to read this book, even though it's outdated, to get background for a trip that's planned. However, unlike any other Michener book I've read, this was dull, dull, dull. I didn't finish it."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"This is not like most Michener books, which are generally fictional; this is his personal travelogue of his impressions of many travels all over Spain. It should be understood that it was published in the late 1960s and that much has since changed in Spain since that time. While 'Iberia' is normally taken (in the USA, at least) to incorporate Portugal, Michener is writing almost exclusively about Spain in this book.Michener clearly loved Spain and knew many Spaniards as friends. He discusses Spain's history, culture, art, literature, dance, geography, sports, and spirituality. Rather than putting all that into nice neat little buckets, he weaves it all together to paint an entrancing picture of the Spanish soul as he knows it.Unlike many such authors, Michener uses photos very carefully to illustrate aspects of Spanish culture, from the assuredly adamant eyes of the Guardia Civil to the warm smiles of the poorest people. He also takes a lot of time to explain words that are difficult to translate and what they tell us about Spanish culture.Recommended with equal enthusiasm whether from the viewpoint of history, religion, culture, or art. Also of special value to those living in Spanish-speaking countries or regions with large Hispanic populations, as Spain's influence on those cultures, as a mother country, is readily apparent.Bravo, Sr. Michener. Faltan mucho a Ud."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"As an avid fan of Michener's fiction, I decided to pick this book up to see how Michener dealt with nonfiction. I can without hesitation say that Michener is at his best in this genre. &quot;Iberia&quot; is a stunning achievement of meticulous care and fascinating recounting of events.His account of Spain, though dated now by thirty years, made me feel as if I were there travelling side by side with Michener. It is wonderfully detailed and always engaging. There are long sections that are just descriptions of art and architecture, and being the art philistine that I am, these became a bit tedious. Still, my appreciation of these passages came less from the art described than from the obvious passion with which Michener describes them...This book is a must-read."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"Although I have read literally thousands of histories, geographies, and anthropologies over the years, I had always avoided Michener thinking he was a \\"popular writer\\" not an academic. After reading 'IBERIA', I know now that not only is he popular but is a knowledgable and insightful observer and analyst. He writes about Spain in a personal yet authoritative manner and manages to cover most of the major themes of the Spanish way of life without being pedantic. The only shortcoming I would ascribe to this book is that being written almost 40 years ago towards the end of the Franco regime, the book, in parts, is dated by more recent developments in Spanish history, politics, and societal change. This, of course, is to be expected in a book largely a history of then contemporary Spain. Michener has given us a snapshot of Spain as he knew it during the 1930's, '40s, '50s and '60s. Although Spain has changed along with and in many cases more than other parts of the world due to not having changed much for so long, Michener's descriptions and insights remain largely accurate and relevant even for readers in the 21st century. Even if some anachronisms are included, they still hold interest as a description of how much Spain has changed in the 25 years since Franco's death."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"I rather like the un-Michener form of this personal travelogue. It's a fun break from his usual format. Moreover, you can tell throughout the book that he was profoundly moved by Spain. His observations at times have profound clarity and hs writing in parts soars to pinnacles of great beauty. However a certain arrogance and petulance also shine through. The most trying times are when he is expressing the very partisan views of the French historian Louis Bertrand. These tend towards the extreme pro-conquistador and anti-moorish who dismisses mesoamerican civilization out of hand and explains the origin of Spanish personality quirks (at least in stereotypes) as having come from the moors. I prefer a little more balance, and a bit more support if one does make sweeping statements. But I still found it to be an enjoyable glimpse into Franco-era Spain."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"an avid fan of Michener's fiction, I decided to pick this book up to see how Michener dealt with nonfiction.

A note of caution the spain michenor describes is not present day spain,the book is more a passionate history."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"This is not a Michener novel but a Michener personal travel journal about the Spain he traveled in for thirty years and knew very well. It is rich with information about all aspects of Spanish culture and life. Michener was a writer who loved people, and loved talking to them . And this book contains the accounts of hundreds of conversations on all aspects of Spanish life.It describes in great detail some of the main areas and cities of Spain, Madrid, Cordoba, Salamanca, Sevilla, and the Entremurada region.It gives a tremendous amount of detail on different kinds of food and places of accomodation.It is often in this regard very critical.Michener is a very good writer but not a great one. And there are passages of the book which are very interesting but fail to reach a higher level of poetic inspiration.A number of the set pieces in the book are truly wonderful. I greatly enjoyed his account of the medieval Jewish traveler Binyamin Mitudela and the comparison Michener makes between his travels and times and Mitudelas.The book is dated in certain ways. It is of course not up - to- date politically. But also in attitude. I think no editor today would allow the passage in which Michener talks about why all young married Spanish women are fat and content. And how they know in the land of no- divorce their husbands will not leave them even though all the husbands definitely take more attractive women as mistresses.Michener writes a lot about bullfighting a sport he admires. I however found many years ago in the one bullfight I attended a lot of cruelty. I think more people today would share my concern that the cruelty to the animals simply does not justify the glorious spectacle of the bullfight.On the whole I think it is possible to learn a lot from this book about Spain, and too about James Michener."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"More than twenty years ago, James Michener's historically based novels Chesapeake, The Convenant, and Centennial provided the catalyst for a lifelong obsession with history as recorded in books; an obsession that quickly made ample room for non-fiction. As the spark for this terminal appetite, Michener continues to possess sentimental value though I've long ago completed his impressive list of novels. Iberia, a non-fictional piece of travel writing, had long sat upon my shelf awaiting the day that some stimulus would prompt me towards an in-depth view of Spain. When the moment arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.Iberia was written in the mid-60's and is, in truth, an amalgamation of Michener's myriad trips to the region beginning in 1936. It is evident throughout that Michener was deeply in love with Spain. It is also evident that the scope of his intellect was profound. There isn't a facet of Spanish life - it's government, history, architecture, customs, cuisine, and geography - of which James Michener wasn't intimately aware. His ability to converse effectively on such a wide range of topics is beyond commendable, even if his opinions, on occasion, may grate.If there's a downside to Iberia it's Michener's fixation with architecture. I, for one, do not enjoy detailed architectural description without accompanying photography or drawings. One can only absorb so many arches, statues, transepts, apses, bastions, crenelations, cloisters, etc. without an image to look at. Another minor, though memorable, disappointment is Michener's defense of bullfighting. Yes, yes, bullfighting IS Spain, an art form, a tradition, but tormenting an animal to death played better 40 years ago than it does today.At nearly 800 pages, Iberia is an abundance of finely crafted detail. It is beyond question worth the investment in time, though beyond question a dated look at a fascinating peninsula perched between the Old World and the New."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"I just finished reading Michener's Iberia, and it's unlike any other book I've ever read -- unlike Michener's novels in that it doesn't follow a real plot, only a very tenuous outline of his travels in Spain; and unlike any other book I've ever read, really, in how he portrays the land he so obviously loves.Michener sets out with a tale of his first sight of Spain and his first voyages through the impoverished rural lands in the 1930s. He then proceeds to examine Spain, bit by bit, starting with Extremadura in the Southwest and finishing up with a grand pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. Every step of the way, he recounts his experiences in fresh prose, not so much concentrating on major tourist sights, though these are described, but the places, the festivals, and the events of his personal odyssey in Spain that demonstrate something about the land.Michener describes many important festivals, like Pamplona's famous fer&iacute;a de San Fermin with its running of the bulls. He visits landmarks both well-known, like the Prado, and obscure, like the wildlife preserve at Las Marismas. Most interesting for me, he describes time and again his conversations with the Spanish, and he met a lot of them, from the poorest peasants to one President of Spain and a tertulia, a group of the nation's most distinguished intellectuals. It is in conveying a sense of the Spanish people that this book really shines.I read this huge travelogue in preparation for a trip that will take me through Spain, and I was consistently impressed by Michener's ability to select anecdotes that demonstrate something important about the land. The further you read, the more convinced you will become that Michener is a brilliant man, able to perceive the things in Spain's art, in its cuisine, and in its music, that make it really spectacular. Only he could have written such a book, and he did it with obvious relish. The result is a brilliant portrait of Spain."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"&quot;Iberia&quot; is a travel log which Michener compiled over years of trips to Spain. His love and respect for this &quot;castle of old dreams and new realities&quot; are evident in his poetic and informative language. We are also treated to people who, though nonfictional, are characterized as larger-than-life members of a fantastic story. Not having even been to Spain, and despite the book's age (30+) years, I feel I have been there many times and could take anyone on a tour of the nation. Fabulous."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"An excellent narrative about Spain and the Spanish people. I've lived in Spain for 4 years and find the insights spot on.

Though I did not read it cover-to-cover, I enjoyed reading passages about places I had seen or events I had read about. It is a very dated account of Spain, but in many ways that is part of its charm. He refers to the Republicans in the Civil War on occasion as the &quot;Reds&quot; and at times seems to have swallowed a Racion of Franco propoganda in one gulp. I found his description of the events of the siege of Toledo quite telling: he admits parenthetically that his account is based on one particular right-wing book and that many of the facts he had subsequently learned were apparently a Fascist myth."},{"Title":"IBERIA","review":"This book is a rambling, dated, starry-eyed tourist's view of Spain.

It is a book that should be removed from the inventory of the seller."},{"Title":"The Spiral Calendar and Its Effect on Financial Markets and Human Events","review":"Bought this book in 1994 and have watched the predictions.Timing is more exact than direction. This accounts for the price reduction over recent years. Carolan's comparison of 1987 with 1929 is different, but every bit as amazing as John Murphy's Intermarket Worldwide Crash analysis of those two pivotal panic moments.Upon pondering Carolan's concepts, I developed a home-made projection indicator (via Metastock) which gave me chills as to how it could pinpoint turns in the US stock Idx. A key was to correct his table in the back (p155) \\"Natural Time Days\\" to weekly (Friday only) data. Using current data of Boolean logic where 1=HHV(H,5days) & -1=LLV(L,5days), and then subtracting a sum of the current \\"Even Spiral Days\\" from the current \\"Odd Spiral Days\\", Nodal turning points into the future of the data series could be isolated. Projections in different markets carried the same patterns. Major volatility breakouts could be isolated within 3 days. The quality of these patterns was consistent across various markets, but was unusual in that the \\"indicator\\" would \\"compress\\" to where the smallest turn would lead to the biggest market whop. Thats the poop for the technically inclined... I lost interest in pursuing this when eSignal locked my eyes on all that intraday streaming data.Upon examining Carolan's comparison of the 1929 & 1987 panics, I believe it impossible for thinking readers to ignore the stunning observations he makes. We like the ocean's tides are quantitatively moved by forces bigger than ourselves. This book is a classic I do not intend to sell. Would love to see others pursue research in this area."},{"Title":"The Spiral Calendar and Its Effect on Financial Markets and Human Events","review":"I found this book quite a delight. The author stumbled upon his theory while comparing two Stock market charts.

Thanks to the author."},{"Title":"The Spiral Calendar and Its Effect on Financial Markets and Human Events","review":"Chris Carolan's Spiral Calendar brings to light the undeniable discovery that important market moves can be linked together in time using a more natural, and therefore more efficient time system based on Fibonacci and our own moon. By &quot;more efficient&quot; I mean &quot;more efficient than man-made time units.&quot;This is one of those books where you will need to read it once over, put it away for a few days, then read it again in order to be able to fully grasp everything that is being said. It can get pretty complicated at some points, but Chris does his best to display the information and explain things in a way that makes the most sense.Yes, as a previous reviewer pointed out, some of the systems have not yet been perfected. You must understand that this is only the tip of the iceberg for a completely new way of looking at not only market behavior but the world around us. Chris lays the basic foundation for what I hope one day will be pursued as a real supplement to market forecasting, especially Elliott Wave (and if no one else does, I am, so it'll get done one way or another).In a way, this book may be the modern day equal to the R.N. Elliott's original writings back in the 30's; a great discovery but very much in its infancy.So this book is about as &quot;complete&quot; as you can get because it tells pretty much all that is currently known on the subject at this time."},{"Title":"The Spiral Calendar and Its Effect on Financial Markets and Human Events","review":"Beware of long convoluted gobbledygook from anyone. It won't work. This book is a fine example -- Check out chapter 10, &quot;Future Forecasts&quot;. Carolan says there will be a big top about October 1995. Was there? No. Then &quot;Expect a major low in the Dow Jones Industrial Average near Monday, July 27, 1998.&quot; There was a small low in October which led to the rally into 2000 but all July had was a small top. This guy is batting 0 for 2, which is perhaps to be expected given his odd semi-astrological methods. There are tons of good ways to measure the market that do work. You don't need this book.

The work I did does, in fact, confirm that Chris's methods work.On the other hand, using them is non-trivial. I have not put in the work to incorporate the methodology into my own work, but perhaps I should. I have seen how well Chris uses his own methods; his results are very good indeed.I will say that if you expect a quick read that makes you an instant multimillionaire, this is not the book for you.

Busoni also copiously illustrates Cervantes' life from boyhood to deathbed, war to prison, marriage to theatre career. Though told in the form of a novel, Busoni gave critical attention to the actual facts of Cervantes' life and while some dialogue or details here and there may obviously be told with some artistic license, the essence of the history is accurate to the core. Busoni actually visited many of the sites discussed in the book and for his time, may have been one of the most respected scholars of Cervantes' life and times. For anyone studying Cervantes, Don Quixote, or The Man of La Mancha (musical), this book is an invaluable resource into the man behind the legendary &quot;knight-errant.&quot; Unfortunately, it's long out-of-print and library copies are few.

After reading this book I had a new understanding of the world around me and WHY it has become what it is today.Evolution, Capitalism vs. Socialism, religion, Abortion, what causes great societies to live...and die, and amazingly, insanely almost, how, of all things, dogs fit into the entire picture.

John showed me a pre-release copy of his newest book, American Eagle. My 13 year old nephew from California looked over my shoulder as I turned each page, stunned by the breadth and depth of John's photographic coverage of this symbol of America. To say this is a remarkable book is an under statement. My nephew summed up how magnificant this book is when we were driving back home. &quot;John's pictures are amazing,&quot; Shane said. &quot;I'm going to start saving today so I can buy that book when it comes out!&quot;"},{"Title":"The American Eagle","review":"Prepare yourself for another exhilarating adventure by one of wildlife photography's most talented photojournalists. John Pezzenti, Jr. has the unique ability to take his reader on a journey filled with fascinating tales and unparalleled photographs. In the American Eagle Pezzenti brilliantly captures the very essence and spirit of an American treasure - the powerful and majestic bald eagle - photographed by many but rarely to such perfection. Depicting the bald eagle in every conceivable situation, Pezzenti begins his photographic journey from the Florida Everglades through picturesque New England and northwest to Alaska - his home territory. I thoroughly enjoyed Pezzenti's engaging stories and portrayals of the dedicated eagle protectors across America who work tirelessly toward the survival of this magnificent bird. The photos alone make The American Eagle a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone with an adventurous spirit and a love of America's national treasure. Once again, Pezzenti has proven himself to be one of wildlife's finest photographers working in the field today."},{"Title":"The American Eagle","review":"Finally, a book on our nation's icon that does not bore you to death in thirty seconds with facts and statistics. Instead, the information is laid in and between the personal and heart-warming stories of biologists, scientists, and unique people that are responsible for our eagle's return. The narrative, although short, gives us the true reasons the Bald Eagle is back and repopulating our skies. In relationship to Mr. Pezzenti's photography, it is clear that he is not only unparalleled in his field, but has taken nature photography to a new level. He is without a doubt, second to none.After reviewing an advanced copy five times, my mind still could not absorb the imagery of Bald Eagles in this book. How on earth does Pezzenti capture not only eagles fighting in mid-air, but the multitude of eagle photos with clarity, precision, and artistic appeal? Impossible! As a naturalist and nature lover, I believe that Mr. Pezzenti would be hard-pressed to duplicate his Alaska book (actually, no one ever will). But his American Eagle certainly runs a close second. I love this book."},{"Title":"The American Eagle","review":"This book is absolutely exquisite.

The images in this book depict the undying strength and tenacity of these magnificient birds, never before has any person dedicated so much time and talent to such an unforgettable journey through the troubled life of our American icon. This book will be the unreachable standard by how all future and past eagle books are measured. It will never be duplicated in our lifetime.

From the time you see the cover, you are completely riveted to the spectacular images contained within the pages of this incredible effort. John has captured on film the story of the Bald Eagle like no other. From birth to adolescence, maturity and death Jonh's stunning images ( many never before photographed behavior)have given us the rare opportunity to glimpse into the world of this magnificent bird. The pages take you across the country illustrating the plight of the eagle, as well as conservation efforts to re-establish it throughout its traditional range. Each photograph illustrates John's dedication, passion and incredible ability. I look forward to seeing more from this extremely talented man. I highly recommend this book to all. Congratulations John, continue your groundbreaking work!"},{"Title":"The American Eagle","review":"John Pezzenti certainly has a way with words that will bring you with him as an unseen guest in experiencing the majesty of the nature he describes and portrays through his masterful and exquisite use of photography. I have read few nature books that where able to draw me in and allow me to sense what he as the author saw and felt, and then even hold me in the place of desire to read and see more. John was a master of experiences submerging himself into nature, without disturbing the fragile bond, even when in the place of grave danger. This is one of three books he created (and I am blessed to have) viewing God's creation from his naturalist purest position. Wonderful reading with exquisite imagery, highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The American Eagle","review":"The author is as gifted a writer as he is a photographer.

The first three books present the general principles of the Gentle Art and how to use them to handle hostile language coming at you. The remaining books each deal with using these principles in specific situations. Each can stand alone and the ones I have read have been very relevant to their subject. In this book, Dr. Elgin discusses how to impart negative messages or criticism to others without increasing hostility in your language environment. The first part of the book deals with an overview of hostile language and its cost both to society and our personal lives. I thought this information was interesting because the way we use language is taken for granted and it is a fascinating idea that each one making deliberate and thoughtful changes in the way they use language can have a great positive influence in our world. The remainder of the book gives practical ways to pass on negative messages without resorting to hostile language or making an already difficult situation even more so. Where it is applicable, the different ways situations are handled by men and women are discussed. One of the things I appreciated most in this part of the book was the use of scenarios. These dialogues enabled me to see and hear both the way a particular situation is handled and how using that particular technique would be better. Since there are many occasions which require the passing of negative information, this is a very practical book and one I would recommend for everyone. As a volunteer reference librarian in a public library system, I think it would be a good addition to public libraries also."},{"Title":"How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable: Getting Your Point Across with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense","review":"I have read several books in the Verbal Self-Defense series and in all truthfullness I must say that the first book - Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense - made a terrific impression on me.

I felt quite disappointed reading &quot;How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable : Getting Your Point Across With the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense&quot; I was expecting to see some concrete steps I could use in daily interactions with people but all I saw were trite explanations and a rehash of the earlier books."},{"Title":"How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable: Getting Your Point Across with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense","review":"The Gentle Art series is written for &quot;normal&quot; people.

However (to me at least), I think these are THE two most important steps in that these are when we REALLY start to work on changing for the better. Without God's assistance to remove these defects of character I don't think there's really much change to come about and 'If nothing changes...nothing changes' and you'll either live miserably, grouchy, and irritable OR simply go back to your drinking/drugging days eventually.

So anonymously published...These people have absolutely NO business talking about such matters.The Alcoholics Anonymous text describes the preparation for steps 6 and 7 and the pages prior and how to proceed after. Bill W dedicates 2 paragraphs 14 lines to both the 6 and 7 step. If one thinks they can remove their own character defects by their own power and need some direction...? Go for it. I needed specific directions and in a brief a form as possible. The \\"Big Book\\" makes very clear AA is not a self help program.

If that is so, then the material in 'Drop The Rock' is for those of us at the Masters or Doctoral level.This book is NOT for the newcomer. Nor is it for those who are blissfully filling their days by 'not drinking and going to meetings'. 'Drop The Rock' is clearly targeted at those who have been sober for some time, but find there are still persistent annoying life problems that resist the all the work one has put into fixing these flaws.This book is short, concise and to the point. The authors have left out much of the new-agey recovery jargon and slogans that weighs down most meetings. Instead, they approach Steps 6&7 from a practical and logical perspective which demystifies the two steps on which so much of our future happiness hangs.It is an excellent book.

It is a must have for anyone serious about true recovery. There is no reason we should be prisoners to our own character flaws. Break the chains, drop the rock, call it what you will, but quit living in the problem and start living in the solution. Talk is cheap. It takes practice and time.The main reason I wanted to write this review is to warn people about the misleading information about the number of pages. I decided to buy the second edition (150 pages) because I though it had been substantially changed from the first edition (96 pages). If you base the page count on the 96 pages of the first edition, then this second edition has only 91 pages. So it's not possible for it to have changed substantially. I was a little upset when I first got it, but I decided to justify the purchase through the study of the actual differences, which can't be many.

I have 101 days of sobriety. One of the first things I learned on coming into AA is that everyone has their own recovery program. In the Big Book, I read that AA's 12-step program is a simple program, and that in AA we seek progress rather than perfection.For my recovery program, I am satisfied to follow what I read in the Big Book and in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions (\\"12 X 12\\"), and what I hear from my sponsor and from my fellowship in AA meetings. None of these sources present anything like the complicated and at times ritualistic approach to Steps Six and Seven found in Drop the Rock. If I pursued the program described in Drop the Rock, I'd soon find myself in a state of paralysis brought on by the fear that I hadn't gotten it exactly right. The suggestions in Drop the Rock are far too nuanced and far too many in number for the book to be described as practical. In contrast, Steps Six and Seven seem entirely doable as presented in the Big Book and the 12 X 12.Because my goal in my recovery program is progress rather than perfection, I expect I will be revisiting Steps Six and Seven many times in the years to come.

Later, I was driven to collect information on H-R and that drive resulted in the H-R Handbook in 1989 and the Charlton Guide in 1999. To me, Nancy's book transcends the mere information-gathering and tells the Hagen-Renaker story - the whys and wherefores of this bunch of people expressing themselves in clay. They made so many things - goofy, beautiful, bizarre - you just knew something special had to be going on there. The colors and detail of some pieces is just amazing and Nancy's book shows that.I hate to admit it, but sometimes I dream of H-Rs and I absolutely got gooseflesh when I read of Pat Kristof still dreaming of being &quot;at the pottery after all those years.&quot; This book is that dream."},{"Title":"Hagen-Renaker Pottery: Horses and Other Figurines","review":"This is a wonderful &quot;story&quot; book - it covers the story of the pottery and the people who helped make it what it is today.

In an area with so few books already, a book like Glucklich's is a gem.The author takes many approaches to the topic, ranging from anthropological, physiological, sociological and psychological to break down the use of pain (both self-inflicted and inflicted by others) into an insightful, understandable read. The book is filled with massive amounts of great content, as well as excellent citations from other good works and scholars, as well. The book is academic and scholarly, but hardly a dry read.I purchased this book because of my academic interest in body modification and pain ritual, but used it massively in a 'Religion and Psychology' course. I still find myself removing it from the shelf every now and again to look something up.Whether you ultimately agree with what the book presents, one will still find the book very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Sacred Pain: Hurting the Body for the Sake of the Soul","review":"astonishingly good! glucklich has a brilliant, original mind (as well as being extraordinarily erudite) and it is absolutely entrancing to see how he interprets and synthesizes a wide range of material (& i don't ordinarily get excited about academic books in general or theology in particular...)"},{"Title":"Sacred Pain: Hurting the Body for the Sake of the Soul","review":"Great research and a new way of looking at pain.

The seven authors present case studies and essays from the recent past that puts various aspects of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model (PM) to the test. The results should interest anyone who wants to understand more about the media manipulation of public opinion and its effects on the democratic process.Six of the authors are Canadian and one is American, offering what might be considered a North American perspective on the issue. In fact, most of the case studies examine the behavior of leading Canadian media organizations such as CANWEST Global, the CBC and the Globe and Mail, but the significant influence that U.S. media has on Canadian media is often discussed while several chapters focus specifically on U.S.-centric stories. In any case, given that the PM is a structural analysis and that similar patterns of media ownership and control exist in Canada and the U.S., most Americans will probably recognize the dynamic interplay of capital, state and media that is described in the Canadian case studies to be similar to what may be observed in the U.S.One of my favorite essays, \\"Newspaper Discourses on the Environment\\" by Robert Babe tests one of the PM's hypotheses that environmental reporting does not accord with the media's primary goal of promoting consumption. Mr. Babe's study about the Kyoto Protocol in the Canadian media finds that most pieces about the proposal to combat global warming were presented as a political power struggle but not as a scientific or environmental issue. Opinions expressed from the perspective of business were accorded prominence compared with environmentalists and the public, whose thoughts were marginalized and trivialized. Worse, ambiguous opinion poll results were selectively publicized to purportedly show a lack of public support for the proposal. While Canada eventually did sign the agreement with majority support from its citizens, Mr. Babe amply demonstrates that media reporting showed a pronounced tilt towards the pro-business position while mere lip service had been paid to the environmental position.Another noteworthy article is Robert Jensen's \\"Dan Rather and the Problem with Patriotism\\" which might be read as an exploration of Herman and Chomsky's contention that the media self-censors and adopts modes of behavior that instinctively serves the interests of the powerful. In this case, Mr. Jensen argues that proclamations of journalistic independence issued by the corporate media establishment should be viewed with suspicion, especially when prominent individuals such as Dan Rather urges citizens to yield unquestioningly to their political leaders. Contending that blind patriotism only serves to embolden a dangerous and imperialistic U.S. foreign policy, Mr. Jensen makes a compelling case that crisis is the time when the U.S. commercial mainstream media fails most profoundly in its task of challenging the powerful and maintaining the kind of dialogue that is necessary for a healthy democracy to survive.Other contributions include Valerie Scatamburlo-D'Annibale's outstanding critique of the American media's reporting of the Iraq War and its failure to challenge the imperial ambitions of the Bush administration; Robert Everton's discussion of how Canadian media has sometimes misrepresented events in the Middle East in accordance with Israeli government interests; Peter Eglin's analysis of how sources in the U.S. successfully fed news reports to Canadian media that presented an uncritical and pro-American perspective to the El Salvador conflict in the 1980s; James Winter and Jeffery Klaehn's piece about the anti-globalization protests in Ottawa reveals a Canadian media bias in favor of capital and against the protesters, whose actions are presented as disorderly and whose motivations are discredited through interviews with unofficial sources; Jeffery Klaehn's assessment of Canadian reporting of the East Timor invasion from 1975-1991 traces media support for the Indonesian government's aggression to large Canadian business interests; and two pieces by Jeffery Klaehn that serves first to introduce Herman and Chomsky's PM and then later to defend the model against its critics at the end of the book.I highly recommend this insightful and thought-provoking book to everyone."},{"Title":"Filtering the News: Essays on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model","review":"It's helpful to consider industrial manufacturing when considering the products produced by the mass media. As any physical product is limited by the dimensions of machines - so is the news, as it is constrained by specific financial objectives. Logically, other forms of limitation flow from this arrangement: advertising as a primary source of revenue, the biases of owners/parent companies, the positioning of experts, and dominant cultural ideologies.The media position their product to invoke an emotional response - this is the angle; and thus the product manufactured is not only the medium, but the unwitting viewer.Filtering The News is a fair attempt to change our outlook on 'objective reporting'. Spanning several different current and historical events, it poses no solution, but a model that cuts through the dogma of dominant institutions.One review here mistakenly assumes that this book is about liberalism and responsible journalism. Criticism of one chapter does not merit a one star review for an entire book. If one looks at their frequent - perhaps overzealous - reviews an obvious pattern emerges. I will say no more, but I would encourage readers to seek out the biases evident in extreme ranges of opinion, and to draw their own, informed, conclusions."},{"Title":"Filtering the News: Essays on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model","review":"Robert Everton's chapter examines Israel Asper and CANWEST Global's propagandistic, undeniably pro-Israel coverage of an attack by Palestinians on Israelis in Hebron, on Nov 15, 2002. It also examines CANWEST Global's \\"institutional mememory\\", the Toronto Star and Globe and Mail coverage, as well as the NYTs coverage and contextualization in the NYTs.Everton relates the case to each of the five propaganda model filter mechanisms -- corporate ownership and profit orientation of dominant media, advertising, sources, flak, and anti-communism/dominant ideology.An unbias assessment, anyone?Now let's talk about the chapter on Iraq . . ."},{"Title":"Filtering the News: Essays on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model","review":"Many readers will be interested especially in the article \\"In Sync' - Bush's War Propaganda Machine And The American Mainstream Media.\\" Other articles are almost as up-to-date, while all deal with media issues relating to events within recent years. Another one of the nine articles by academics in the fields of media and communications is about Dan Rather and controversial stories he was involved in toward the end of his career. Media coverage of the civil war in East Timor, environmental problems, and the Israeli media are other subjects anyone who keeps up with today's media, current events, and public issues will recognize as well. In most of the articles, the Propaganda Model--abbreviated PM in one article--is used as an analytical tool for seeing how the mainstream media misrepresent or distort events, individuals, and contexts. The articles' general critical stance toward the media will be familiar to most readers--but the keen critiques of the varied important media stories introduce considerable new material. The articles are models for a media criticism and skepticism that is just beginning to be revived."},{"Title":"Filtering the News: Essays on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model","review":"Is news filtered? Sure. Are we being fed propaganda? Of course. And there is a good reason to have a credible book tell us about it. This book isn't it.This book has seven authors, and it consists of nine articles. But it loses any crediblity it might have had in Chapter 3, a 32-page article by the late Robert Everton. Everton discusses bias in the Canadian media on the topic of the Arab war against Israel. But rather than argue for responsible journalism, he seems to demand even more bias against Israel, pretending that this would be fair. And while he acknowledges the fact that some people say there already is plenty of media bias against Israel, he pretty much dismisses it as ultra-right-wing propaganda.I'm a liberal. I want responsible journalism. And I want human rights for all. There are some people who want bad journalism so they can aid the fight against human rights. If I make some mistakes, I think it is proper to point them out, and say that I am incorrect, or mistaken. It isn't helpful to instead dismiss me as being ultra-right-wing. For one thing, it isn't true. And for another, it makes it seem that whatever truth happens to be, it is just politics.Obviously, I want to see responsible coverage of issues about the global environment. As well as East Timor. But I don't trust the authors of this book to help me get that. They have no credibility with me, and they support bad journalism."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"The reason I came down one star on this second book in the Gil Cunningham series is simply because there were so many characters to try to keep track of. This murder takes place within the confines of the University of Glasgow. There are 33 characters in the list provided by the author and those names do not include anyone outside the University or within the families and servants Gil is dealing with. One of the students has been murdered. Hugh, Lord Montgomery has decided to claim the dead boy as one of his kin and has given the University until the young man is buried to find the killer or he will begin torturing anyone associated with the University he can get his hands on until someone confesses.This story takes place only a very short while after the conclusion of the first book,Harper's Quine: A Gil Cunningham Murder Mystery, so if you have read that book you will find yourself right back in the same location with the same people to deal with. In the first novel I enjoyed the way the author had Gil confer with Alys and her father over the entire mystery so we all solved it together. That is how this novel is constructed also, but everything is done at breakneck speed because of the deadline on finding the murderer or Montgomery will force someone, anyone, to confess and then dispatch them. I found myself hopelessly twisted up over who was with whom doing what at what time so that I honestly ceased to care. I figured I could catch most of the obvious clues without trying to keep track of everyone and that proved to be true. The atmosphere of scholastic life in medieval Glasgow was extremely interesting for me. This author does have a tendency to include sentences in French and what I call old Scots without necessarily giving a translation. Often I can figure out the meaning on my own, often I could not.This series of novels does give my brain a pretty good workout. Not only in solving the mystery, but in looking up words which I don't understand and trying to decipher foreign (to me) phrases and sentences. If you don't want to work quite that hard when reading, you might not find these books to be entertaining. Personally, except for the over-abundance of characters, I still thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"I enjoyed reading the book.

In the meantime, Pat McIntosh gives us a taste of what he might have meant in her second of a series featuring Gil Cunningham in \\"The Nicholas Feast.\\"Set in 1492 (a convenient year for any historical writer!), \\"The Nicholas Feast\\" finds young (and still single) Mr. Cunningham, student of law and nephew of a local official, embroiled in solving his second murder in less than a month (The first being \\"The Harper's Quine\\"). Gil is on hand to observe academic ceremonies of his alma mater during this church holiday and it's now time (hardly before lunch) that a murder is committed. Young William Irvine, one of the students and an actor at the pageantry observance, is found in the coal house with lots of clues and non-clues scattered about his person. He is the bastard son of the influential Montgomery family and Gil discovers that he is even more than that. He's a 16-year-old extortionist, who many at the school would have motive for his death. Complications, indeed, arise. And Gil is given two days to solve the case. Or else.McIntosh clearly demonstrates her knowledge of historical Glasgow (which apparently was no more beautiful than it is now) and following the success of her first Cunningham novel knows how to create a readable historical murder mystery. Her style is terse and moves quite easily--except for the fact that, in order to accentuate the local color, she drops into too much Scots dialect for most American readers, anyway. Some would be fine, but too much is, well, too much and it becomes a stumbling block at times.The plot moves quite well, despite that, until the climactic scene (ah, yes, Ms McIntosh has read all of Agatha Christie's works, it seems) and relies upon the old \\"gather everyone in parlor and I'll tell solve the crime while surrounded by all the characters who COULD have done the deed.\\" Sigh, indeed.Character-wise, though, the author gets a good mark here. Clearly, she's entranced by her central character (as she should be) and Gil Cunningham has the makings of a fine 15th century sleuth and academic. His romantic interest, Alys, though comes across a bit syrupy but credit goes to the author for providing us with a 15th century woman, ready to jump into the 20th century: she can read; she has a mind of her own; she's ready to act independently; and she's also likeable. I suspect Ms McIntosh will wed the two sooner of later.A third in the series is already out (a good sign). \\"The Nicholas Feast\\" is a good read. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"While I liked this book, I did not feel it was as well written as the first book in the series. It felt as though the author was pushed to have a second in the series too fast to do as complete a job. Hopefully, the next book will match the quality and detail of \\"The Harpers Quine.\\""},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"The sub-genre of historical mystery is a tough nut to crack. The writer has to be careful not to drown the story with the details of the period, or color the characters with the too modern traits. And lets not forget the whole point of this genre- the puzzle.Pat McIntosh unfortunately fails miserably on all accounts. Far too many characters, the thick Scotish brogue, and realy bad dialogue. By the end I couldn't care less who kiled who and why. As a compulsive buyer of mysteries, I am stuck with two more hardcovers by this author. Serves me right."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"This is the second book in a mystery series set in 1492 Glasgow, only two weeks after the events detailed inThe Harper's Quine. Gil Cunningham is trying to settle his personal-life changes (such as formally getting betrothed to his brilliant and beautiful Alys, and Mom coming to town) when he's called upon to return to the University for a traditional feast. During the feast, a student is found murdered -- and Gil's just the guy to find out who's responsible.The mystery itself is only so-so (which means that I figured out whodunnit well before the end), but the characters are engaging and the historical details are great. The people have \\"everyday humor,\\" giving you reasons to smile at the page rather than to laugh aloud. (Plus there *is* a wonderful dog, and that admiration is coming from a cat-person.) McIntosh does an excellent job of bringing 1492 Scotland to life without dangling it distractingly in the reader's face, from what might be served at dinner to the current state of political intrigue.The result is that this is not an \\"Oh wow you must read this!\\" novel, but it is a very enjoyable historical mystery with just gosh-durn-good storytelling. You'll probably like it more if you read the first book before this one (also, it IS a little bit better), but nothing in this tale requires information from the earlier volume. If you're in the mood for \\"Hey, just give me something good to read,\\" you won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"\\"Gil Cunningham said later that if he had known he would find a corpse in the coalhouse of Glasow University, he would never have gone to the Arts Faculty feast.\\"'But then,' said Alys his betrothed, considering this seriously,' you would ever have met Socrates.'\\"In 15th. century Scotland, Gil is a learned young man who was destined for the Church until he met Alys during the course of his previous encounter with mystery and murder. Now, he has to contend with facing his indomitable mother coming to town, and seemingly not at all reconciled to her son's career and life decision. To top it off, he has two days to find the murderer of the student found during the Nicholas Feast at his old university, before the wrath of the powerful Lord Montgomery, a relation of the dead student, and an enemy of Gil's clan, falls upon the University and Gil and whomever may be in the way.The student is found strangled in a locked coal cellar, and had his share of people who may have wished him ill. He was an over-bearing, unpleasant boy who was intent on spying and secrets and not above blackmail and extortion.The author gives us a medieval mystery with nice detail into the workings of a university and the town, engaging characters, a sleuth who perhaps loves quoting verse a little too much, but who is still young and human and yet level-headed and perceptive; aided by sweet and intelligent Alys and her French master-mason father. Even the more squalid and disreputable or hard and violent characters still retain some worth and humanity. The mystery is nice and complex, with secret codes and part logic problem of who was where and when, with diverse clues and suspects. ... And there is the delightful Socrates.I enjoyed the characters, the setting and the mystery and will look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"I had read one of the later books in this series (title was something about colliers) that worked as a stand-alone. Nicholas Feast however was very confusing. I think it would be much better to read The Harper's Quine, the first book, before reading Nicholas Feast."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"I enjoyed this enough to buy the next in the series.

I will agree to some extend with the reviewer commenting on too many characters in the story. Pat McIntosh may have lessened the number but then remember, we are on a campus of education during term. Valid point but for me it did not negate the continuity between the first novel in the series,The Harper's Quine (Gil Cunningham Murder Mystery)and this second novel. The sub plots of family, clan struggles and impending marriage for the main characters certainly kept my attention. I gave it only a 4 star rating not because of the extras within the story but because I had some troubles in remembering who and how they were related to the respective topic. As before I would recommend this E-book for those into historical fiction. For anyone who might care, I am currently reading the third novel,The Merchant's Mark (Gil Cunningham)."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"As a mystery lover and historian I enjoy discovering books like the Gil Cunningham murder series. The Nicholas Feast was the second in the series that I read (I'm on my third right now) and found it to be clever and entertaining. McIntosh has vividly recreated a very different world, one in which it mattered very much who your family was and to whom they gave allegiance. She also gives us on the ground looks at the church and the importance it played in people's lives in late 15th century Scotland. In this book Gil Cunningham, formerly destined for the church but now engaged to Alys Mason, investigates the murder of a young and generally unpopular student at Gil's former school. Suspects range from fellow students to a noble and relative of the murdered boy and include a priest as well. Gil, along with his fiance and his future father-in-law Pierre, sort through the clues, motives, and complex family ties to finally reveal the murderer. In this book we also get to meet Gil's mother and get more details into family life in this period. Yes, as another reviewer noted, there are quite a few unfamiliar words in the book. Some are included in the Kindle dictionary, some are not. For many of them the author uses the common term in the following sentence or two, helping us understand. Others can be figured out from context. For me the language of the 15th century Scots was fascinating and added, not detracted, from the reading of this book. If you like historical mysteries, check out this series."},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","review":"A fine series that does not disappoint as Gil and his love, Alys work together to find a murderer. The setting in Scotland, that dialect and character development are well done. Read the series progressively from The Harper's Quine on and the relationships between the characters are fun. Pierre Mason, Gil's good-father is a surprise as he is an intellectual expatriate from France with great critical thinking skills. I have sincerely enjoyed the series and will eventually purchase all of the volumes on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Secrets of DR Taverner","review":"This is probably my favorite book. there is so much practical occult knowledge packed into these pages it is amazing----epsecially since it is framed as fiction! This is the story of Rhodes, a Doctor fresh from the horrors of World War I, and his faithful relationship with Dr. Taverner, also a Dr. who just happens to be \\"The Senior of Seven,\\" a senior adept of a world-wide,secret, mystical fraternity. Rhodes gets to tag along as Taverner enters into combat with the forces of the shadow and many other aspects of the occult scene along the way.

It starts out with an obscure prologue that had me shaking my head but that was only the beginning. Once the story got into gear it became incoherent and nearly impossible to stick with. Character motivation isn't explained and as a result most of the characters come across as little more than cardboard cutouts. Secondary characters pop out of nowhere with little or no introduction and only serve to muddy up the plot further than disappear never to be heard from again. And, because there are so many constant interuptions, the love story suffers greatly and is forgotten for chapters on end The couple have almost no time to get to know each other before they are declaring their undying love to one another. Sorry, I just didn't buy it.And totally unromantic sentences like this one did not help to endear the hero to me at all: &quot;His tender feelings didn't scatter, as he remembered her fingernails scoring his back, and the most marvelous words a man in rut can hear - Don't stop.&quot;A man in rut? Ugh, is this a hero or a pig?The author had some good ideas but sadly her writing style had me reaching for my king sized bottle of Advil."},{"Title":"Snow in Summer (Haunting Hearts)","review":"This book was an exasperating waste of time. The author has a very disjointed, difficult-to-follow style of writing.

The author's style is convoluted, with the entire case of characters literally thrown at the reader in a very few pages. I had to go back and reread parts of the beginning in order to properly identify the characters' relationships to one another, and the secrets in the plot are only hinted at for a fairly long time. Once I got over my surprise at how difficult the reading was, I could appreciate the story. I found myself thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading the book, a sure sign that they were drawn well and with depth. The author draws out the sexual tension between the two protagonists in a way that keeps the reader going for more. The villain is a nicely created sociopath with little conscience; just when I thought he was a harmless bother, he turned homicidal without a second thought! I even found a metaphor contained within the story, something I don't normally find in this genre - one's heart is where the love is, not in a box. I recommend this book, but don't expect to be able to read it in one sitting. It's a little too complicated for that."},{"Title":"Snow in Summer (Haunting Hearts)","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The chemistry between the hero and heroine was really great.

Although I'm not positive that I received a historically accurate picture of who the man was, I don't care. I will add the character of Thomas More to my list of heros and role models taken from fiction (along with Atticus Finch).I see many high school students have written reviews against the piece, but I think they are the age group that most needs to hear it's message: follow your conscience. In the end, it wasn't the King or even the Pope that More was most loyal to, but his own sense of right and wrong. To quote another famous, English play: &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot;Besides which, More chose to resist in the least conflicting way. He didn't lash out and condemn everyone for going along with the king. He silently refused to comply. Granted, he was trying not to get his head cut off, but still, his example of righteous living rather than righteous blabbing is something we all need in our quest for tolerance and peace."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"It never fails: The books are always better than the movies.

These men are rare at any day and age and yet every bit as valuable. In the fantastic work, A Man For All Seasons, by Robert Bolt, this is the type of man that Thomas More is. Thomas More's dilemma between his conscience and his duty is a struggle that many people face everyday. Bolt really captures his struggle in the scenes when his family comes to try to persuade him to give up his thick headed silence. More finds himself having to fight for God's laws when all others place the kings laws first. Unfortunately, if you like happy endings than this may not be the book for you. When More is brought before the Court, he tells those assembled, \\"It is a long road you have opened for first men will disclaim their hearts and presently they will have no hearts. God help the people whose statesmen walk your road.\\" More does all that he can to be the best example that he can be but will that be enough?

Thomas More was a political figure in the time of Henry the VIII. He was a committed catholic and wrote a very large number of religious works. When Henry declared himself head of the church More refused to take the oath of supremacy. He was executed as a result. Last century More was made a Catholic saint.Bolt's play however is secular. He sees More as a man who has principles and will stand against the state. The play was written in 1960 against a background of the problems of totalitarian regimes.The real more was a person who was to say the least unpleasant. He wrote long turgid books filled with foul language declaiming heretics. He was prosecuted under the enclosure legislation for restricting peasants access to land. His role also involved the prevention of vernacular copies of the bible coming into England and the persecution of heretics. Some writers suggest that he had a torture chamber in his house.The picture of More in the play is not sanitised it is a work of fiction. It is constructed to make him a figure who is perfect and brings life to everyone. In reality his death was a selfish act. More was terrified of being condemned. His death meant that his family was thrown out on the street and stripped of their possessions. More knew that this would happen and he put his personal salvation above the comfort of his family.The characters in the play are two dimensional. The villains Ritch and Cromwell are pathetic creatures. In reality Cromwell was a man of more interest and complexity than More. The most annoying character is \\"everyman\\" who acts as a narrator and does bit roles. He is meant to be a solid English yeoman type but is from the land of caricatures.Thankfully the play is now so dated they don't subject school children the agony of reading it."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"&quot;Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons&quot; was not condensed, but was merely the play reworded.

Even if you have seen the film or the play and feel you know it well, the small amount of time needed to actually read the play is well worth the effort. You can move at your own pace rather than the director's, and you can pause to ponder or reconsider points that strike you. And if nothing else, Bolt's paragraph-long sketches of the major characters are priceless. The context for what happens is Henry VIII's desire to divorce his first wife Catherine (the widow of his brother and predecessor) and marry Anne Boleyn. The ostensible reason was the failure of Catherine to produce a male heir, and the convenient justification was the Old Testament's prohibition against marrying a brother's widow--a prohibition that had been relieved by papal dispensation in order to allow Henry to marry Catherine in the first place. Now Henry wanted the pope to grant another dispensation, effectively undoing the first, to allow the divorce. This the pope would not do, though the precise combination of religious and political motivations can only be guessed at. With the assistance of willing advisers and cronies, Henry eventually breaks with the Church in Rome, establishing himself as head of the Church of England with the right to appoint its bishops. This paves the way for his divorce and remarriage, but he wants all important opinion-holders to add the weight of their assent. Thomas More, the Chancellor during the middle part of the play, refuses to acknowledge the king's right to a divorce, and it is on this refusal that the drama of the play hinges. Since it is based on history, everyone knows the outcome. More, once a great friend and favorite of Henry's, and to the end a loyal subject, is imprisoned and eventually executed (though the latter happens only through the willingness of ambitious courtiers to perjure themselves). That's the story, and Bolt doesn't change it. It has enough inherent drama that he would be a fool to tamper with it. His great ability is to give words to the historical figures that display their characters (we may suppose) and their motivations, heightening the drama by its own inevitable logic rather than by any contrivances. There is no \\"action\\" to speak of--only carefully crafted dialogue that is beautiful and memorable, but also seems somehow natural. A non-believer himself, Bolt had the task of doing justice to the bone-deep faith of More, a man he openly admires. He accomplishes this movingly and profoundly, and is neither dismissive nor cynical about either the quality or the quantity of the faith that motivates More. Anyone, whether or not they have seen the film, can benefit from reading this thoughtful and moving account of the conflict between faith and ambition."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"Sir Robert Bolt's great play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; is still as fresh today as it was in 1966 when the movie version (screenplay by Bolt) won six Oscars. Check recent headlines; both Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and House Judiciary Counsel David Schipper have attempted quotes (mis-quotes) from the play. In the passage that both men attempted to quote from but fell far short of the original's power and drama, Sir Thomas More responds to the fanatic Roper's assertion that he would cut down every law in England to get at the Devil. More responds:&quot;...this country's planted thick with laws ...and if you cut them down...d'you really think you you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety's sake.&quot; Read the play and determine for yourself if Starr or Schipper, to use More's words &quot;...construe(d) from it according to their wits.&quot;"},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"A great many stories surround Sir Thomas More (1478-1535.) To some, he was a man of integrity and principle; others thought him vicious and cruel. The debate between historians has continued down through the centuries to the present day, but most of the more casually interested English-speaking world tend to think of More as a good, honest, deeply religious man who was wrongfully martyred by King Henry VIII and his advisors. In short, they tend to think of More as he is presented by Robert Bolt in the 1960 play A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, which opened in London in 1960, in New York in 1961, and was then presented as an award-winning film in 1966. Although it is a difficult play to produce, it continues to be widely performed, and is regarded by many as a masterpiece of 20th Century theatre.The story should be at least vaguely familar to every high school student who has studied English or European history: Henry VIII wished to divorce his wife, Queen Katherine, who was barren, and marry his mistress, Anne Boylen. At that time the Roman Catholic Church was dominate in England and the Pope refused to accept this divorce and remarriage. This being the case, Henry separated England from the Roman Catholic Church, created the Church of England, and declared himself head of it. Not everyone was enthusiastic about this, and notable among them was Sir Thomas More, a noted scholar, author, die-hard Catholic, and at the time Henry's Chancellor. More attempted to avoid a confrontation by simply remaining silent, but when the king attempted to force him to sign a document acknowledging the king as head of the church, More refused. He was brought to trial, convicted, and beheaded.The play, which is in two acts, is unexpectedly Brechtian, freely breaking the fourth wall by use of a narrator, 'The Common Man,' who plays various servants and working men as the play progresses, always watching from the sidelines and ready with a cynical remark. The first act sets up the situation, in which More places himself in harm's way--partly recognizing the risks he runs in becoming Chancellor, but not entirely aware of the potential perfidy of friend Richard Rich and the extraordinary ambition of Sir Thomas Cromwell, who is eager to assume the office of Chancellor himself. More ultimately faces the ultimate test: he can submit and sign in spite of his religious belief, or he can refuse to sign and hold fast to his religious belief in full knowledge that he will executed. The play is powerfully written, and it is easy to see why it is so famous.Whenever I review a play I like to note that plays are not really written to be read. They are written to be seen, and the script is essentially a blue print that is interpreted by artists and technicians. Consequently, people who are unused to reading plays often find it difficult to imagine how the script behaves on stage before an audience. This is not actually true of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, which I think reads as well as it plays, but it is a wordy script, and some may have difficulty with it. Even so, it is more than worth the trouble. Powerful, memorable, brilliant.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"This is one of my favourite books.I have read a few of the 'bad' reviews of the book - one that commented on its historical 'correctness'. The story of Moore was just one aspect to the play (I felt anyway), the common man who appears throughout the play is supposed to remind us of ourselves. The common man is quite confronting as the character reminds us of our own need for self-preservation above all else.

The well known story is told primarily through the perspective of More's resolve to stand on his principles despite pressure from a variety of sources.

Bad, because I can't cite specifics the way some of the other reviewers here have. Good, because the play has stuck with me for decades.As one of the negative reviews notes, it's not always historically accurate--More's personality and behavior were not as near-perfect as the play suggests. However, the major facts are correct and plays (like other works of entertainment) are permitted a certain lattitude.More important, however, is the battle of truth and &quot;right&quot; against falsehood and &quot;wrong.&quot; And, from this standpoint, the play is near-perfect. More's speech comparing laws to trees--and warning against cutting them down--is an absolute classic.The play works well both historically and as a parable for modern times.

Although I'm not positive that I received a historically accurate picture of who the man was, I don't care. I will add the character of Thomas More to my list of heros and role models taken from fiction (along with Atticus Finch).I see many high school students have written reviews against the piece, but I think they are the age group that most needs to hear it's message: follow your conscience. In the end, it wasn't the King or even the Pope that More was most loyal to, but his own sense of right and wrong. To quote another famous, English play: &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot;Besides which, More chose to resist in the least conflicting way. He didn't lash out and condemn everyone for going along with the king. He silently refused to comply. Granted, he was trying not to get his head cut off, but still, his example of righteous living rather than righteous blabbing is something we all need in our quest for tolerance and peace."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"The only thing I really have to say to people who read this play is...Do some independent research on Sir Thomas More, and you will realize what a skewed charicature of a man Bolt presents.

Not that the play isn't entertaining or well written, and not that I have anything against the Catholic church, it's just disturbing to see people say that this play has &quot;good historical value&quot;.So read it and enjoy it... or not... but remember to always take historical dramitizations with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"This book, after reading some other reviews, has not touched me nor filled me with hatred.

It's considerably deeper than your typical airport reads, though since it's a play you can finish it quickly.Bolt does an outstanding job in the Preface talking about his motivation, his direction for the character and persona of Sir Thomas More. What's most interesting I think is how he handles the character development. I won't ruin it for you, but I think it needs to be said that this is not the story of a man changing because of events but almost the inverse.Language is very easy to read and understand, though some passages will certainly benefit from rereading just to consider what the message is, what Bolt is trying to get across. I loved the book and would love to see an adaptation of it."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"From biblical times to the present, it is evident that power corrupts those in charge. One of the landmark examples of this in history is Henry VIII's murder of Sir Thomas More. Truly if you are not with the powers that be, you are against them.Henry VIII's attempts to dissolve his marriage on account of his wife's inability to bear him a son, falls on deaf eyes in Rome. Even while the pope will not allow divorce, Henry hopes his loyal subject Thomas More will condone it. Sir Thomas More's silence is deafening to the king. Unable to stand the silence of this influential, the king's servants drum up charges to treason to rid the king of his problem. During this process, we see a man growing from a lawyer to a saint. He will not place the sovereignty of God behind the king.I would give this story 4 1/2 stars because it sacrifices too much of Thomas More for literary purposes. This is bothersome because of the initial slow pace of the story. Still Robert Bolt does a commendable job telling this story of integrity and allegiance to God."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"A wonderful and dramatic companion to the Selected Writings of Saint Thomas More, Robert Bolt's A Man For All Seasons is a superb piece of literary drama, because it makes More's own writings, specifically The Sadness of Christ, come to vivid life. Christ's sadness and More's understanding of our Savior's heavyheartedness unto death, by way of the play, presents a reliable and honest portrait of Thomas More the man and the saintly holiness of his unyielding commitment to the Truth in him, for Christ who is in us is apart of us. And in the play, on page 121, More lets that very fact be made known that his faith is an integral slice to his very identity, his being. It is distinct, especially when he responds to Norfolk upon being strongly advised to give in and submit to King Henry VIII's oath to the Act of Succession, whereby the king is viwed as the Supreme Head of the English Church which incorrectly overrides the authority of the Vatican: \\"I can't give in, Howard. You might as well advise a man to change the color of his eyes...\\" Strictly adhereing to a commitment, especially a religious one, can, in of itself, be a cross, because it implies so many different things, not just a physical suffering, but it includes doubt, torturous mental anguish and unthinkable sacrifices of the most terrifying sort. Are the actions that lead to a particular moment in one's life a mere social-political-philosophical stance or a divine offering of the most extreme sort to test that human love for God? In A Man For All Seasons, More's response to his son-in-law, Roper on page 126 is thus: \\"Now listen, Will. And Meg, you listen, too, you know I know you well. God made the angels to show him splendor-as he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity. But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind! If he suffers us to fall to such a case that there is no escaping, then we may stand to our tackle like champions...if we have the spittle for it. And no doubt it delights God to see splendor where He only looked for complexity. But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to that extremity! Our natural business lies in escaping-so let's get home and study this bill.\\" For the majority of us, we do not have the 'spittle' as More describes, because pragmatic intellectualism is easier to subscribe to than divine bondage and empyrean love. And when one accepts the latter, as More ultimately does, he is punished for it, first with a stripping away of his title and affluence, then with imprisionment and separation from his family: \\"Content? If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be through it.\\" Pg 141. Like Jesus Christ, whom More felt in him all along, he too suffered and felt sadness unto death. A Man For All Seasons is a riviting play, one that makes you take a closer look at the meaning of commitment and what it entails. Like Peter, after reading this play, I would definately say that Thomas More was a contributing rock to the foundation of the Church."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"Bold held me from the first wordto the last.

The concept of the inviolate conscience of the individual, which stands against all those that would corrupt it (even the state) took root in me then and has influenced pretty much all I've thought ever since. When I was older I read the play and was impressed by Bolt's character of &quot;The Common Man.&quot; He is really the voice of the popular culture, the voice that says watch the trashiest TV programs and vote for the most charming political candidates, even if they are venal. It is the Common Man who leads More to the scaffold, all the while protesting that he really means well and good-naturedly has Sir Thomas' best interests at heart.

In More we have a man who did both."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"I definitely recommend this play detailing the struggle between St. Thomas More and King Henry VIII. It asks the important question: \\"How long can a man's conscience hold up against constant outside allurements and pressures?\\"It is a good quick read (3 hours at most)."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"A Man for All Seasons has long been my favorite, whether in written form, stage play, or motion picture. The story is fairly simple, another angle on the drama of Henry VIII. Sir Thomas More is a deeply religious man, much troubled by the king's break with Rome and the establishment of the Church of England, naming the king as head of the church (directly contravening the idea that Christ is ultimately head of the church, indeed, Catholics believe the church to espoused to Christ). In an attempt to keep the peace, and his neck, More resigns his office and refuses to make any statement about the issue of the break with Rome or the king's divorce what-so-ever, even to his own wife.Unfortunately, it would appear that while the king doesn't want to follow the rules, he also doesn't want a bad conscience. This requires him to get the 'blessing' of someone known to be reputable on the subject, so that his conscience may rest at ease. By circumstance of who he is, More is chosen. A document is drawn up in the Parliament, rather craftily, to which subjects of the king are required to swear.Upon refusing to swear to this document More is thrown into jail. He will neither make a statement about his thoughts on the document, nor make explanation for refusing to swear. In More's thinking, he has been forced to choose between his bodily life and his immortal soul. Eventually More is tried and convicted of High Treason, carrying the sentence of death.The play is wonderfully crafted and does an excellent job of being subtle and emotional at the same time. It is the essence of a morality play. When push comes to shove, and egos, life, inheritances are on the line, where will you fall?Some criticize this play for not being historically accurate in some matters. I toss these criticisms aside with two short arguements 1.In some matters, such as More's feelings and private dealings with the king, we will never know the historical truth. 2.Most important to remember, it is a play, not a history text. It owes no wage to historical accuracy.This play is a very easy read. The language is simple enough. My only suggestion is that those readers who are not Catholic may want to do a tiny bit of research about basic Catholic theology concerning marriage and divorce, in order to understand some of the motivations in the play."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"This book is the essential companion to the movie. Or do I have it backwards?So, to what lengths will a man go to keep his honor? Is everything for sale? This is the story of conscience over expediency, which is a message we need right here, right now, especially in DC. The problem with politics and principles is perennial, but it has become a bit more exacerbated with the war on terrorism.We rally behind More since he stands up for conscious. It is an interesting dilemma, since we might criticize him for not being more vocal or proactive in his stand against the king, but More does say that God made \\"man to serve him wittingly, in the tangle of his mind! If he suffers us to fall to such a case that there is no escaping, then we may stand our tackle as best we can. . . But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to that extremity! Our natural business lies in escaping!\\" (p. 126)The best plays are the ones that make you think yeas after you experience them. This is Bolt's spell, and we can never escape.This is almost a perfect play. The only flaw is that More ends up with the best one liners, while the antagonists Henry VIII and Cromwell have lifeless lines without the wit and sparkle speeches that Bolt have given to More.One of the intriguing aspects of this play is all the subplots, or rather, ripples across the ocean of events. These sub-plays augment an already powerful story, and help bring more light and detail to the story.One ripple is Richard Rich. He is a young man with burning ambition. More wisely counsels him to become a teacher, instead of involving himself in affairs of court. Rich ignores the counsel, gets caught up in the sausage-machine of state, and eventually perjures himself in More's trial. More did not have a price; Rich's price was Wales.Henry VIII is another backgound mover, and the driver of the events in the play. He wants an heir, but at what price? The dynastic wars had just been settled, and his line was established, but he had no heir. Harry VIII was a bit of a playboy like Harry V, but Harry V eventually grew up. Henry VIII went to every extraordinary extreme to have an heir, from marrying his wife, to divorcing his wife, establishing a new church to soothe his conscience, and finally sanction the death of his one and only loyal friend. His price was his pride.Another sub-ripple was the romance between Margaret More and William Roper. Thomas was, of course, a staunch Catholic, but Roper was a new Lutheran, and there was religious tension. Thomas forbade his daughter Margaret from marrying Roper until he returned to Catholicism.Two characters were almost ignored in the play: Wolsey and Alice More, but I guess that you can't have everything in a two-act play. Sigh!The 1966 film adaptation left out another sub-plot Senor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador. Since Katharine was from Aragon, Catholic Spain had quite an interest in having the first marriage remain in tact.Aside from reading a history book on the man and the time, I would recommend the companion classic of Shakespeare's play \\"Henry VIII,\\" which tells how Wolsey accidentally got Anne Bolyn and Henry VIII together at a dinner party, and how Wolsey fell out of favor with the King. Surprisingly, Shakespeare only mentions More once (III.ii.468), but we understand the edgy politics during Shakespeare's day.Bolts quick wit and ability to compress complex ideas into compact catchphrases, what are called \\"bumper-sticker\\" lines in the film industry. I would like to read more of his plays."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"I am currently reading A Man For All Seasons as a school project, and I am enjoying it more than any other book that I have read in school. This play is an incredible work of art that thoroughly and accurately depicts the personality and moral values of Saint Thomas More, the man who was &quot;the King's good servant, but God's first&quot;. Sir Thomas More became King Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor under one condition: that he be left out of &quot;The King's Great Matter&quot;, which, if you didn't know, was the King's conflict with the Pope over his desired anullment from Catherine of Aragon. However, Henry is not satisfied with this, and he is determined to have a blessing of his marriage to Anne Boleyn from Sir Thomas. More, however, is a devout Catholic, and he believes that Henry's anullment from Catherine was not valid, and his morals will not allow him to bless the King's marriage. In hopes of forcing More to agree with him, the King administers an Oath claiming that he is the supreme head of the Church in England, and that Anne Boleyn's children would be the heirs to the throne. Sir Thomas refuses to sign the Oath, and, after spending almost 2 years in the Tower of London, is beheaded. A Man For All Seasons is a great play, for it really shows the reader the kind of man that Sir Thomas was. The other characters are also well written (particularly Sir Thomas's daughter, Margaret). If you are a drama fan, history buff, or someone who likes to read books with great moral substance, A Man For All Seasons is the book for you."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"Please don't make students read this book! Being part of an assignment is enough to ruin any literary work for the reader, no matter how great. I first read this play while in Grade 10 (two years ago), without being forced, and I relished every word from beginning to end. It was so engaging and enjoyable that I couldn't put it down, and I actually laughed aloud and cried several times while reading it after classes and on the bus. This play got me interested in Renaissance English history, and I have learned a lot since then which I can relate to characters and events in A Man for All Seasons.There is the criticism that Bolt made Sir Thomas unrealistically good and considerably more tolerant than he actually was, but Bolt admits this himself in the introduction included with the edition I read. In this play, historic events and of Sir Thomas More's personality are taken and molded slightly to provide a demonstration of one's man dedication to his faith and his conscience. The dialogue is brilliant, the characters are well realized (within the heroic structure for which Bolt was aiming), and--despite what some may consider a boring premise, certainly not me--the plot and issues are fascinating. It really made me think, and I've come back and read it several times when I feel like I need an idea to ponder. A marvellous play to see performed as well, especially when there is a very capable actor in the title role."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"The basic facts of this story are surely well known. When Henry VIII unexpectedly became heir to the British throne upon his brother's death, the Pope made a special dispensation to allow him to marry his brother's widow, the politically desirable Spanish princess Catherine. Later, when Queen Catherine failed to produce a male heir for King Henry and as she became increasingly plain and more deeply religious, Henry sought to have the Pope nullify the marriage for the very reason that it violated Christian law for a man to marry his brother's widow. Sir Thomas More resigned his post as Lord Chancellor of England in 1532 because of his opposition to Henry's plan. Henry having taken England out of the Catholic Church and established the Church of England with himself at its head, Anne Boleyn was crowned his new Queen in June of 1533. Henry passed the Act of Succession in March 1534, which required all who should be called upon to take an oath acknowledging the issue of Henry and Anne as legitimate heirs to the throne, and to this was added a clause repudiating &quot;any foreign authority, prince or potentate&quot;. More was summoned on March 14, but refused to take the oath and was sent to the Tower of London. He was indicted for treason in July and at trial solicitor-general Richard Rich testified that More had denied Parliament's power to invest Henry with ecclesiastical powers. Despite More's denial of the statement and his avowal that Rich was a perjurer, he was convicted and was beheaded at Tower Hill on July 6, 1535. For his willingness to be executed rather than renounce his oath to the Pope and the Catholic Church, Thomas More became a martyr and was eventually sainted. Protestant England became the greatest nation on Earth and developed the political, religious and economic institutions upon which all successful modern nations are based.Robert Bolt's great play presents in simple, unadorned scenes, the dilemma of a man of conscience and serves to remind us of how rare and valuable such men are in every age. Bolt's More argues that a man who will sacrifice his conscience has lost something central to his being:When a man takes an oath, Meg, he's holding his own self in his own hands. Like water....and if he opens his fingers then--he needn't hope to find himself again...And in the play's greatest passage, he argues for the centrality of the law, over and against men, in the governance of human affairs, when his family wants him to have the disloyal Rich arrested:Wife: Arrest him!More: For what?Wife: He's dangerous!Roper: For all we know he's a spy!Daughter: Father, that man's bad!More: There's no law against that!Roper: There is, God's law!More: Then let God arrest him!Wife: While you talk he's gone!More: And go he should, if he were the Devil himself, until he broke the law!Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down (and you're just the man to do it!), do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!Finally, when he is brought before the Court, More warns those assembled: &quot;It is a long road you have opened for first men will disclaim their hearts and presently they will have no hearts. God help the people whose statesmen walk your road.&quot;[For those of us of a certain age and political persuasion, these lines will always call to mind the impassioned plea by Henry Hyde (R, IL) for the Senate to hold President Clinton answerable to the laws of the land. But then as in More's time, there were hardly any ready to withstand the leveling political wind that was blowing. No Cabinet Member or Administration employee resigned in the face of the President's misconduct and lies. No Democrat Senator voted for a single article of impeachment; all succumbed to the cult of personality. It was particularly appalling to watch men like Moynihan, Lieberman and Byrd betray every principle for which they have spoken in public life. For one awful, but thankfully brief moment, we saw the dread specter of what it's like to live in a world where the whims of men are paramount, and the rule of law a farce. Well might we, like More, ask God to help a nation where the statesmen have no hearts, where they place their masters above the law.]In the end, Henry's actions set England upon the path to becoming a great nation and made him a world historical figure. But even, or especially, a great nation needs men like Thomas More, who stand willing to vindicate the rule of law regardless of their personal feelings and interests. More, who followed the dictates of conscience, rather than the diktats of a king, is truly one of the great men of history and remains a vital example to all mankind.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"The exceptionally talented Robert Bolt, who wrote the very literate and memorable screenplay for Lawrence of Arabia, turns his attention in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; to the conflict between Sir Thomas More and King Henry VIII over the question of Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn and the subsequent creation of the Church of England in order to jusify it. More believes that the marriage is not legal and that attacks on the church are not justified, and cannot make himself swear the mandated oath recognizing Henry as the head of the church in England. Since More is Chancellor and one of Henry's chief advisors, this sets the stage for that well known conflict that ends with More being beheaded.The miracle that Bolt achieves with this play is to bring alive the conflict of ideas and principle that the mundane question of Henry's irregular marriage occasioned. This is a wordy play, but Bolt is a master of words, and there are enough pithy and memorable exchanges here to fill a book of quotations. The real historical characters were fascinating, and if Bolt has streamlined the story and simplified some of the rough spots that just serves to heighten the dramatic intensity of the inevitable tragic end. As a man of consience, More cannot renounce his faith. He is torn between serving a King to whom he owes allegiance and saving his soul, and the King gives him no out. Even after renouncing his office and refusing to make any public statement about the marriage he is hounded by the King's menions and finally imprisoned in the Tower of London.The cast of characters that seal his fate are not - with the possible exception of Cromwell - evil men. The King is selfish but willing to forgive if More will take the oath. Richard Rich, More's former student whose perjured testimony finally condemns him, is merely venal and willing to sell his self-respect for advancement. More's best friend, who goes along just to be left alone, simply doesn't want to risk his life and title and can't understand More's stance. Even his family has trouble coming to terms with why he will not bend. Knowing from the beginning how this will all end adds a layer of complexity to the actions of those characters who try to influence More and/or benefit themselves.Finally, to return to the language of the play, this is really great writing of a particular kind. Bolt has the ability to sum up complex arguments in a few telling phrases and to find memorable turns of speech that make actors want to say the words and audience members want to hear them. This is simply one of the best plays of its kind ever written and I can't imagine it ceasing to be performed."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"This play is not about Thomas More the man, as much as it is about Thomas More as an archetype. Bolt has taken More and idealized him into almost mythical proportions. This is not difficult given that the historical reality was larger than life to start with, but those looking for insights into the real More won't find them here. The playwright was not striving for a biography. He wanted to use More as a launching point for a reflection on Being. This is in some ways a Platonic work, and in this sense, Bolt's idealization of More is entirely acceptable, and the play, entirely successful.In a way, the play, idealized as it is, does not do the man justice. It presents Thomas More as little more than an ideologue. There is a reference to his friendship with Erasmus, but the real More was accounted one of the foremost philosophers of his time and enjoyed a moral prerogative throughout the western world that is difficult to credit in our own cynical age. The closest modern equivalent might be Martin Luther King or Mohandas Gandhi.The play presents him primarily as a unique man of the world. However, as a true Renaissance man, More was of considerably broader genius. He gave us the word &quot;Utopia&quot; and formalized the concept within western thought through his writings on this namesake perfect society. His essays may seem dated and nave today, but this is unfair, viewing them as we do through the filter of the intervening centuries. In addition to being a lawyer, judge and Chancellor, More was a scholar, author, essayist, philosopher and minister.But the play is concerned with none of this. It focuses on one aspect of More's character: his acute sense of Self. The person of Thomas More commands our respect, because he possesses a strength of character that we all admire, some envy, and a few hate.But where does this strength of character come from? Strangely enough, it's not faith, in the traditional sense of the word. The playwright uses faith as More's particular moral centre because it happens to be true in More's case. But we are allowed to generalize from More's case to our own, and Bolt argues that for every man, even the nonreligious, an unshakeable sense of Self is necessary for life to be worth living. More would not cross the line drawn by his faith because, in his case, his faith defined his Being. Is there a line we would not cross? A line defined by our own core values and beliefs? Contrast More's character to that of his foil, Cromwell, who embodies his antithesis, a life hired out to considerations of 'administrative convenience'.In the end, we are our principles. Nothing less and nothing more. If we destroy our principles, we destroy our Being. You don't have to believe in the divine or in an immortal soul to understand the thesis at the heart of A Man For All Seasons.This is an easy play to read and just as easy to understand. For all its literary beauty and thematic potency, it achieves a level of clarity that is missing in even the great classics. For this reason, some erstwhile intellectuals dismiss it as superficial. Ignore such snobs. This play is made the more wonderful by its accessibility, even to children, and certainly to intelligent youth who could do far worse than to start out on life's journey following the example set by such a man for all seasons."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"Sir Robert Bolt's &quot; A Man For All Seasons&quot; is a familiar story, but Bolt's telling of it is always fresh. The motion picture version won 6 Academy Awards in 1966 including &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; (Bolt), &quot;Best Actor&quot; (Paul Scofield), Best Director (Fred Zinneman), and finally &quot;Best Picture&quot;. The story is set against King Henry VIII's break with Rome, made necessary by his desire to divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. When Sir Thomas More refused to sign the Act of Supremacy, he was brought to trial on trumped-up charges and ultimately beheaded. More had sought refuge in the letter of the law, but he was required to state his approval of the Act in an oath --an oath which would have required him to state something that he did not believe. For More, an oath was an invitation to God to act as witness and judge. In existentialist terms, the oath would have shattered his integrity, his humanity, that &quot;...something within himself without which life is meaningless.&quot; Contrast More with the character, Lilly, of &quot;The Grifters&quot;, a modern character who finds fewer and fewer things that she is unwilling to do. She will make any compromise to survive, including the attempted sexual seduction of her own son. In the end she kills him, and escapes the bloody crime scene in an elevator going ominously down...down...down. Both plays: &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; and &quot;The Grifters&quot; are about the &quot;self&quot; and express the Jean Paul Sartre view that &quot;man&quot; alone among the animals is capable of inventing himself."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"I really enjoyed this play. It dealt with one of my favorite topics: history. However, despite this being a period play, Bolt wisely chose to abstain from obscure references and arcane language. It is not at all difficult to understand the play, despite its setting being 16th century England, under Henry VIII. Also, one only needs a cursory knowledge of English history to fully understand the play. If you don't know that, I'd recommend reading just a few paragraphs from an encyclopedia or text book dealing with Henry VIII's famous series of wives, divorces and beheadings and his withdrawing England from the Catholic church (known as the Act of Supremecy.)The characters of the play, as with the actual people involved in the play, were interesting. However, I think that Bolt could have done a slightly better job in stirring the emotions of the audience at some of the key scenes, such as the last and second to last ones. Since he was dealing with such an emotionally charged topic, some of the characters could have been slightly more sympathetic.But, overall, this is a great play, short and sweet. I'd recommend it for anyone and everyone who enjoys history."},{"Title":"A man for all seasons: A play in two acts (A Vintage book)","review":"I am an 11th grader and i found it pretty easy to understand.

Both of us have read it and love it! It's novel that explores the effects of technology in our world today. It points out in wonderful satire and double speak, how we have allowed our lives to be taken over by technology in our daily living. Everything from computers, palm pilots, cell phones, and news bytes at the bottom of our TV,s define more and more of our thoughts and infiltrate our conversations.

There is no denial of the existence of sexual or other abuse. I think it would be a dense read for people without a scientific background, but it isn't inaccessible, either. The language is readable and the authors manage to keep the content very interesting as they describe the research and events involved. You'll get a systematic understanding of how false memories are produced, and a good understanding as to what factors cause vulnerability. The book is broader than the title, though, with a lot of related information such as how experts, therapists, and law enforcement staff can become biased and contribute to jury bias, false confessions, and false memories. There is plenty of information about limits to creation and maintenance of false memories as well. This is hardly an ideologically-driven book as far as I can tell."},{"Title":"The Science of False Memory (Oxford Psychology Series)","review":"This book is one of 3 essential texts any student of memory (illusory or otherwise) must read (and, I suggest, refer to often).

He was the oldest satyr and the companion, adviser, and tutor of Dionysus. Dionysus is often portrayed as a delicate, effeminate youth.Satyrs are described as roguish but faint-hearted folk, subversive and dangerous, yet shy and cowardly. As Dionysian creatures they are lovers of wine, women, and men, and they are instinctively ready for every physical pleasure. Child satyrs are sometimes depicted taking part in Bacchanalian celebrations.With two satyrs on the cover, what is the book about? \\"In ancient Greece,\\" say the authors, \\"sexual contacts between adults and children were not regarded as crimes.\\" It was not until 1974 that the US Congress passed an act making such contacts a crime (p. 292).The prosecution of these sexual contacts as criminal activities has shaped false memory research, the authors suggest (p. 291). This appears to be true.False memory research recommends we look for suggestive questioning, suggestibility, therapists, books, support groups, movies, or even secondary gain as sources for child sex abuse allegations.Is it possible that such allegations might ever be based upon actual sexual contact between adults and children? Perhaps the answer to this question is on the book's cover."},{"Title":"Goddesses and Monsters: Women, Myth, Power, and Popular Culture (Ray and Pat Browne Books)","review":"Goddesses and Monsters: Women, Myth, Power, and Popular Culture is fantastic! Every feminist could benefit from this book, every womon, anyone with an open, thinking mind, who's not afraid of the truth. This author knows her stuff. This book cuts through the lies of patriarchy, through its mindbindings, and propaganda. Besides the importance of the information within, this book is just a really good read, it's so interesting. The setup is great, you can pick any part and just go from there and enjoy, you don't absolutely have to go from the beginning to get good info from it.

Thank you Jane!"},{"Title":"Walking on the Land","review":"With gritty and brutal honesty, Farley Mowat carries the reader back to the Artic regions in a follow up to PEOPLE OF THE DEER and A DESPERATE PEOPLE and the treatment/mistreatment of the natives by the Canadian government and church authorities. Mr. Mowat paints a vivid picture of the artic region and the various boondoggles designed to &quot;help&quot; the native peoples (which certainly parallels the wretched treatment of Native Americas in this country). What was particularly shocking was that much of this happened in the 1950s. While the subject matter can't always be defined as enjoyable, I did enjoy this armchair travel with the amazing Mr. Mowat.-Mamalinda"},{"Title":"Walking on the Land","review":"Mowat once again deals with the subjugation of Inuit peoples by the Canadian government, the Episcopal and Catholic churches as well as various companies who decide there's big money to be made in the arctic. The government ignores pleas that Inuits are facing starvation and medical crises. Churches try to convert and some officials feel justified in relocating children to specialized schools. Company employees exploit native women for sexual favors in exchange for food for their starving families. There are some good guys here but they are few and far between. Mowat has written a series on this subject which include \\"People of the Deer\\" and \\"The Desperate People\\" all of which report the history, mythology, customs, habits etc of the Ihalmuit people who lived in what is now the new Canadian province of Nunavut-just north of Manitoba. Various pressures, the greatest being starvation, reduced their numbers to less than 200. They were relocated as is related in this book to a coastal region which they were unused to and were not adapted to surviving there. This was another government folly. The Canadians came later to their own chapter in conquering native peoples as this takes place in the 1950's. I say this as a general term because there were and are Canadians who appreciate Inuit culture and attempted to intervene. Mowat himself was not well liked by any of the major players in those episodes which he is very candid about.I am totally hooked on Mowat's work. He is a cultural anthropologist but he's such an adventure writer, a person gets so caught up in the unfolding drama. The characters are so richly portrayed and their customs explained so well that their way of life as it was will forever be recorded in his books even if it has disappeared. By the way \\"walking on the land\\" refers to an Inuit custom of going out into the cold to die. It was done by gracious elders whose younger families faced starvation in order to save children. It was also done by people who felt they had outlived their usefulness."},{"Title":"Walking on the Land","review":"When I was a boy in the 1950s I read Farley Mowat's \\"People of the Deer\\" serialized in an outdoor magazine. That I remember the book 50 years later testifies to Mowat's narrative power in telling the story of the near extinction of the Ihalmuit people in far northern Canada. The Ihalmuit are Eskimos (Innuit) but unlike their sea-dwelling relatives live inland and depend on the barren ground caribou for their sustenance. Mowat is the indispensable source of information for the Ihalmuit and turned out a classic in \\"People of the Deer.\\"In \\"Talking to the Land\\" Mowat describes his revisit to the Ihalmuit in 1959. This book lacks the high adventure of \\"People of the Deer.\\" It indicts the Canadian government, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Catholic missionaries, and big business for their uncaring and criminally stupid behavior in dealing with the Ihalmuit. There are many vivid scenes and characters in this short book. The most touching describes his meeting with the last survivor of the Ihalmuit who sought him out in 1999 and inspired him to write this book.Mowat is a gifted advocate and writer, but I won't give him top marks because his reputation is that of a subjective writer, striving for effect and impact rather than objective truth. Knowing that, I am sympathetic with his views but also a little mistrustful. Did he really have the experiences he describes? Is his assessment of the situation that led to the extinction of the Ihalmuit accurate? Can he be trusted or is he a teller of tales masquerading as a writer of fact?Smallchief"},{"Title":"Wordless workshop,","review":"As a wee lad, I would love going to my Uncle Tom's house where he had stacks of Popular Science magazines.

The characters are fascinating and he evokes a sense of place that makes you feel the author knows every nook and cranny of his subject. The book creates an historical tapestry stretching from pre-Revolutionary days to an end- of-the-millenium July 4th party. It would be easy to take potshots at the rich and richers who live in the Hamptons, but the author, who sees these characters with a clear and discerning eye, never condescends. The book moves so quickly I finished it in one sitting. This is my favorite kind of book-- a non-fiction book that reads like a novel.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"This was a most enjoyable book....a look at how the super-wealthy denizens of the Hamptons really live. The author tells many gossipy tales, but at the same time, gives the reader a great deal of historical background about the early settlers of the area; those who became wealthy via the real estate of the Hamptons; and the mega-wealthy newcomers who seem to delight in flaunting their wealth even as they try to remain anonymous...or perhaps the right word would be \\"mysterious\\".I think Gaines, an insider who lives in the Hamptons, has done his research and perfectly relates the superficial life led by many of the residents there.This book read like fiction and I finished it very quickly. Many of the characters who populated the book were very odd people, ones that a reader would expect to meet in a novel.I found the story of Gardiner's Island fascinating. It was first settled by Lion Gardiner in 1639, and was the first permanent English settlement in New York. Lion bought this from the Indians and it has been owned by his descendents ever since. They allow no trespassing.I also enjoyed the story of The Creeks, one of the largest estates in the Hamptons. It was created in incredible splendor by Arthur and Adele Herter and recently rebuilt by Ron Perelman. In the intervening years, The Creeks belonged to the artist Alfonso Ossorio and his lover Ted Dragon, an interesting couple. These men befriended Jackson Pollock and their story included interesting information about Pollock's life and tragic death.This says it all: &quot;The establishment can hold off the newcomers for only so long.

The cast swings all the way from the old-guard, dullsville entitlement of the folks at the Maidstone Club to polished avant-garde goings-on at The Creeks, in between which Ted Dragon nicks furniture for a hobby. Gaines's adroit telling of these stories will even surprise you into empathy for the neighbors round Barry Trupin's mansion, a poster &quot;child&quot; for matters done with gaucherie and lack of moderation.

A good read, especially if one's planning to visit the region."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"I read the book like one savors a delectable morsel of some rare treat - slowly, deliberately, trying to make every bite last an eternity.Stephen Gaines managed to capture in great detail not only the fascinating and unique history of this town but he artfully blended in the hilarious shenanigans that color today's East Hampton.Most Hamptons visitors and probably most recent residents are unfortunately not aware of this town's character beyond the &quot;rich &amp; famous&quot; banalities usually reported in the tabloid press.What partied-out summer reveler can tell you that:1. The East Hampton Trustees, a body of private citizens, own the waterways to this day through a decree by King George and not even the U.S. Federal Government has succeeded in successfully challenging this right?2. The oldest cattle ranch is in Montauk, not some place in the West?3. Amagansett was the only location in the U.S. that was ever invaded by the Nazis in WW2?4. Captain Kidd's treasure is buried somewhere off the shores of East Hampton?5. Gardiner Island is owned by a man who holds his title from King GeorgeThese and countless other fascinating tidbits were carefully researched and documented in the book along with the bizarre and outlandish behavior of some of our local celebrities.This is a fascinating book that educates the reader through an entertaining style a la Hard Copy.

Hock your gold teeth!\\" says Allan Schneider the then \\"it\\" realtor of the Hamptons. \\"Their money is so new, the ink is wet,\\" - speaking about the influx of: master of the universe, corporate raiders, stockbrokers, lawyers, junk bond kings and financiers that were invading the Hamptons at an increasing rate in the 1980's.Not that the book stays in the 80's. It goes all the way back to the first few settlers and their dealings with the Indians in the mid 1600's. Especially interesting is the history of Gardiner Island and the Gardiner family, who have been the sole inhabitants for generations. Then in comes the Goelet family who came to America in 1676 and later founded Chemical Bank and manages a far reaching real estate empire from an unmarked townhouse on East 67th St. while remaining out of the business spotlight.Also interesting is the history of The Creeks, a 57 acre estate with 2,000 feet on Georgica Pond (a 290 acre tidal pond) with 6 guest houses that is the largest privately held estate in the Hamptons. It's owned by Ron Perelman, who paid $12.5 million in 1993 from an estate who bought it for $35,000 in 1951. When it was sold in 1894 for $10,500 it was called Sheeps Point and the East Hampton Star called the price, \\"a large advance from the original cost\\".The book gives you a good sense of how real estate in good locations can explode in value while sharing some intrigue regarding the who's who of the Northeast and how they jockey for prominence in the \\"social register\\".By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate: A True Story About the Ups and Downs From Wall Street to Real Estate Leading to Phenomenal ReturnsBlog: bloglines.com/blog/KevinKingston"},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"Gaines magnetic presentation of the quest for legitimacy and status by the nouveau riche and their clash with the old-monied, Mayflower plank owners who desperately cling to the blue-blooded rules of order and &quot;code&quot; caused me to miss some outstanding natural beauty during our recent cruise of New Zealand.

Open Gaines' book and discover the wonderful steamy, seamy side of that privilege. Just because someone has plenty of money doesn't mean that they have plenty of sense. Reading Philsitines at the Hedgerow is like peeking through a porthole into a first-class cabin on a luxury liner. One sees aspects of being rich--filthy rich--that one never expected. Gaines is a professional. His writing is beautiful, clear, and logical. His attention to detail is so obvious that no one would ever question his research. If you love detail, if you love &quot;real writing&quot;, read Philistines."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"As a Hamptons native who has moved away from the area, I was very interested by the idea of the book. It read a lot like &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,&quot; with eccentric real-life characters (though no transvestites) and squabbles that are funny to anyone not involved in the situation. However, it seemed rather caught up in mainly covering the socially elite of the Hamptons and was rather rude in its constant dismissal of any Hamptons other than Southampton or East Hampton (Gaines sniffed several times that Westhampton, for instance, should've been called &quot;Dentisthampton&quot;). I think an excellent follow-up, or companion, volume to this book would be if Gaines were to find the same types of fascinating people and stories in the not-so-exclusive Hamptons."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"Mr. John Berendt, step aside...there's a steamroller of a writer on your heels with a splendid book so masterfully well-written, you'll be crying all the way to Chase Manhattan...

Gaines has managed what few authors could possibly have accomplished or had the hubris to suggest: The Hampton's writer went MIDNIGHT... one better and trumped the Savannah book with a full house, or some such.

If you've been to these places you've seen it--the distinctly American phenomenon of super-wealth attempting to forestall spiritual death with ostentatious materialism. That's what this book is about. Though America's super-wealthy frequently have European aristocratic pretenses, money alone does not nobility make. The author makes this point to us through a sometimes not-so-careful critique of specific super-wealthy Hamptonites. He could have just as easily written about one of these other enclaves of flashy, superficial elegance."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"My husband & I wanted to read this book together.

If not a whole new book."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"An interesting and easy to read book that gives some basic early history on the area and towns known as the Hamptons, a wealthy waterfront area of Long Island in New York state, and profiles a number of notable residents and properties through the years. Initially settled because of it's natural beauty and fertile soil, the area became a haven for the wealthy who flaunt their wealth by trying not to appear that they're flaunting it. And over the years it attracted various groups such as artists, gays, Jews, and the newly-rich of the 80's stock markets, much to the chagrin of earlier residents who viewed such late-comers as outsiders lacking their good taste and refinement (Philistines). Several people are profiled such as artists Jackson Pollock and Alfonso Ossorio (and his partner Ted Dragon); successful businessmen Evan Frankel and Jerry Della Femina, and old-money Robert D. L. Gardiner. But the history is much more than just the people who lived there, it's the properties, too, and many homes and places and the changes that happened are covered.Many reviews here mention the gossipy feel of the book, and I'll agree with that. But with the nature of the Hamptons and the people it attracts it's probably natural. Some of it becomes downright comic, especially with the legal codes that are really only used by those with a bit of authority to enhance their own social standing or pay back some perceived slight. As it says in the book, in the Hamptons everybody is somebody and each more important than the rest. To call some of the people 'eccentric' is putting it very mildly, though, when 'weird' might be more accurate. But it's all very interesting and hard to put down sometimes, and you can't help but shake your head at some of the ridiculous stories and people. There are a number of good historical photos included, although no maps, which would have been nice for those of us who aren't familiar with the area. And to echo another common sentiment in other reviews, it's a fun summer read."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"The Hamptons are just like most of the pristine land in this country. Everyday you see property gobbled up and suburbanized. The new owners never seem to have a clue why they liked it in the first place. All they want to do is make it the same as home.

I certainly did"},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"This book is an excellent example of narrative non-fiction that spins along while managing a kind of density of detail and anecdote. The author has written many popular biographies whose subject matter was never commensurate with his extraordinary abilities. And yet, if you carefully read his most recent efforts -- Calvin Klein, Halston, The Beach Boys -- you will see the man's incredible gift for story-telling is grafted to his marvelous sense of detail. Past and present are seamlessly woven. Philistines -- as well as his earlier biography of the Beatles -- is one of the times when the subject mater matches his ability. The characters here are complexly limned, their lives etched indelibly into the reader's mind. Edgey, racey, elegantly written, Philistines is a MUST."},{"Title":"Philistines At The Hedgerow -","review":"Telling this Hamptons history through the various characters and their properties kept me enthralled.

Parents will gain a better understanding of how and why the kindergarten curriculum has changed from a social focus to one that stresses academic skills. Issues such as readiness, screening, testing, and early reading are addressed in an easy to understand manner. Parents are encouraged to appreciate their child's unique learning style and personality in order to make the kindergarten experience all it should be. Teachers will be happy to know that the Golants understand the difficulties inherent in working with 20 or more small children and helping each one cope and develop to the best of their ability (in addition to helping parents cope with their child's new independence!). Many sections of the book would be helpful to use as a resource during parent conferences or in developing a parent meeting. In addition, much of the information could be incorporated into weekly newsletters or in developing a parent handout at the beginning of the kindergarten year. A book that helps prepare young children and their parents for that all important transition to formal schooling is an important addition to any parent or teacher's library. It's a quick, easy, and informative read on a complex issue and should be helpful to anyone who works or lives with a kindergarten age child."},{"Title":"Prodigal Press.,","review":"Olasky used his courage and wisdom to do the research it took to write this book.

The author states that you can never really be totally objective, but you can strive to get as close to it as possible. I would address that the study of a few of the major members of Journalism's history was one of the best chapters of the book because it gives you a shocking prespective of what these men really were and the terrible ends they faced at the end of their tourtured journeys. I was very surprised to read exactly who Pulizer was and what exactly the Pulizer Award may insue when one obtains it.I gave it less then 5 stars because at times, the religious portions of the book get a bit too preachy for my tastes, but then, since it is a christian like peice, it is to be expected and that is fine.

This country would be a lot better off if everyone (especially politicians) read this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Taxing Ourselves, 3rd Edition: A Citizen's Guide to the Debate over Taxes","review":"I though about giving this book 4 stars, because it can be heavy reading at times. I decided, however, that that would be unfair because it would be impossible to discuss taxes with any sort of detail without getting heavy at times. This book makes a tough subject (taxes and tax reform) as easy as possible to understand by taking you point by point through every aspect of taxes, including: 1)Our current code and it's history 2)peoples ideas of fairness with respect to the current code and possible reform 3) Evidence about how taxes effect personal behavior 4) Evidence about how tax code effect economic behavior 4)different types of taxes 5) postivies and negatives of each as they relate to enforcement, collection, economic and personal behavior, peoples ideas of fairness and politics. 6) how other countries tax 7)an examination of a few proposed tax reforms as they apply to all of the above. If you're interested in tax reform/debate, buy this. If you've read books on the flat tax or national retail sales tax, buy this.

Krijn is an emminent doctor who is attempting to write a book on bile ducts, Beatrice is a nurse who is mousy and plain and is resigned to a spinster life ahead. However, she meets the good Professor and falls for him almost immediately. The professor, notoriously absentminded, takes a little longer to catch on, and proposed a marriage of convenience. Beatrice, happy to take him however she can get him, agrees to it and secretly plans to convince him to make the marriage a real one. It take the entire book to make Krijn come to his senses, and realize he's just as crazy about her as she is about him, but along the way its a good story. I felt often sorry for Beatrice, obviously used to being ignored but really hungering for her husband to take notice of her, and I wanted often to shake Krijn and yell at him to open his eyes. But the characters are both likeable, and you really get interested in their romance despite the shortcomings. A high recommendation here."},{"Title":"An Unlikely Romance (Harlequin Romance, No 3222)","review":"This is a Neels book I reread often.

But while fine in theory, the \\"no strings attached\\" deal soon proved to be disastrous. How could it work when every time she saw him her heart skipped a beat? And what could she now do to make him notice her -- Not just as his wife but as his partner?Beatrice, a nurse, is sweet, a little clumsy at times, and generous. Krijn, an Endocrinologist, is devoted to his work to the point of being unaware of anyone or anything else around him. While forgetful and oblivious of any and all things outside of his work, he is at some level, aware of Beatrice. Beatrice is an orphan, taken in and raised by her uncle and her aunt-by-marriage (the substitute evil step-mother) along with her spoiled, selfish cousin (the substitute evil step-sister). It is stated in the beginning that Beatrice is more than a little fond of the good looking, absent minded professor but knows he isn't aware of her existence. While the professor appears to exist only in his work-related word the reader realizes early on that he is conscious of not only her existence but what is going on around her. He surprises her and everyone by being there to catch her when falling (literally) without missing a beat and defending her when others felt it within their right to continue to humiliate her. Beatrice contributes her aunt and cousin to provide family conflict while Krijn contributes a \\"charming\\" cousin.Their family lives, developing relationship, marriage, evolving feelings, realization and acknowledgment of their bond; combined with descriptions of culture, architecture, food, etc. make for a pleasant quick read with a smile-producing ending.This Cinderella-like, absent-minded-professor, marriage-of-convenience is absolutely one of my favorite Neels story and one any Neels fan is sure to enjoy."},{"Title":"An Unlikely Romance (Harlequin Romance, No 3222)","review":"From the back cover: &quot;Agreeing to share her life with Professor van der Brink-Shaaksma had seemed a good idea to Beatrice at the time.

Their journey was also an inward jouney, a self-revealing and self-healing journey. Best of all it was an absolutely fascinaing journey for the reader, whether a Chaucer fan or not."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"Looking for CanterburyReviewed by Randall Dean Marshall, MDDirector of Trauma Studies and ServicesNew York State Psychiatric InstituteAssociate Professor of Clinical PsychologyColumbia University College of Physicians and SurgeonsJason Marks has written an accurate and thoughtful memorial to the many Vietnam Veterans who continue to suffer from the hellishness of war, and the humiliation of their homecoming. His story could not be more serendipitously timely. He gives life to the great loneliness that veterans have felt in a civilian world and, more tragically, among the politically and bureaucratically fragmented subculture of Vietnam veterans since the war.He shows how the power of the past and the depth of shame that connects us to the loved and dead cannot be underestimated; in fact, if one's story is desperately in need of telling, the willful silencing of it can determine the course of one's life. The great gulf between what we expect of ourselves -- i.e., courage and heroism -- and what we actually do in the chaos of battle can become an emptiness that simple forgiveness or religious exoneration cannot fill. He shows how guilt can become the primary emotional connection between the living and the dead, and how difficult it is to find a more livable way of honoring the lost. But most importantly, Mr. Marks reminds us that great literature can play a profound, transformative, even lifesaving part in soothing human unhappiness that springs from the dissatisfaction that moral people feel with themselves.Acceptance of human frailty -- and Chaucer's genius was its portrayal -- can be mysteriously difficult, and profoundly liberating. The descending wisdom of the lost owl, at the end, speaks for itself.I was moved to contemplation of these universal questions -- especially since Spetember 11, 2001 -- by reading Looking for Canterbury."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"What do a New York City butcher, medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer and the Vietnam War have in common? They all served as creative fodder for Jason Marks' powerful and imaginative new novel, Looking for Canterbury. In an impressive literary feat, Marks has successfully applied the premise of an Old English classic to a modern-day tale and produced one of the most brilliant and insightful books you will ever read.As Looking for Canterbury begins, Vietnam veteran Harry Baylor and six war-scarred friends have lost control of their lives. Tormented by emotional demons spawned by horrific experiences in Vietnam, they have battled for years to purge the visions that haunt them and move on with their lives. Conventional therapy hasn't worked and they're quickly realizing that their homegrown support group is proving futile as well. Their destinies seem clear; they will endure mental torture for the rest of their lives. That is unless Harry Baylor has anything to say about it.Armed with half his life savings to finance his plan, Baylor, an enthusiastic fan of Geoffrey Chaucer, proposes that the group recreate the story-telling journey detailed in the poet's Canterbury Tales in New York's Central Park, essentially transforming them from a troop of soldiers to a troupe of actors. The challenge for each of them is to tell a tale that will distract the others from their worries. The only rule: the stories can have nothing to do with Vietnam. Sounds easy, but it proves more difficult - and dangerous - than they had ever imagined. As the trip progresses, the group comes to the painful realization that the demons they hoped to leave behind have, in fact, come along to spoil the ride. The mental reprieve they desperately need is in jeopardy, but they're not giving up. They've got nothing to lose but the remains of their sanity.Looking for Canterbury takes readers on a thrilling, sometimes painful, adventure into the human psyche. Thanks to Marks' profound ability to engage readers in the lives of his characters, you find yourself experiencing first-hand the acute emotions that surface during their journey. Filled with expertly crafted hairpin turns, Looking for Canterbury keeps you wonderfully off balance. Within pages, you find yourself laughing at a humorous tale, shocked by an unexpected emotional breakdown, anxiously anticipating a character's complete disintegration, then laughing again as you're suddenly pulled back from the edge of emotional chaos. Just as Canterbury's characters, you will find yourself enjoying a leisurely stroll through the park basking in rich scenery and heartwarming comradery while simultaneously running a mental race against the subconscious at breakneck speed.With its complex characters, fascinating literary allusion, rich description and gripping psychological insight, Marks' Looking for Canterbury is a 21st century classic, one you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"A unique idea to have a group of Nam vets seek their own Canterbury, complete with costumes, food and even personalities similar to Chaucer's pilgrims, the stories they tell of course differ.

I have no doubt that this book will have a huge impact on my work performance and satisfaction, and it will also make me a much better team player and leader. And, at around 100 pages, Dr. Thomas includes what matters (in an easy-read style) without wasting any of your time."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"Ken Thomas is a gifted writer who uses an informal and entertaining style. However his message is important and insightful. This book is fun to read and can definitely help improve our work experience and that of our associates. In addition to being a gifted writer, he is a serious and respected scholar. This book is the culmination of years of research and thought about intrinsic motivation - a topic which the author clearly believes is critical for personal fulfillment and meaning at work. This book helps us to understand the specific intrinsic rewards that are available through our work - and how to experience these rewards more fully. He provides a diagnostic framework exploring what is needed to enhance intrinsic motivation. In summary, this is an important book. We spend a lot of time working - shouldn't this time itself be intrinsically rewarding? Ken Thomas's research and insights show us how to experience our work life as rewarding and fulfilling - his ideas will help ignite all the passion and energy our work can provide. Read this enjoyable and valuable book."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"Intrinsic Motivation is one of the better books on leadership and management that I have read recently. Thomas targets both managers and employees, arguing that salaries and other extrinsic rewards are neither the sole nor the primary source of motivation in modern organizations. In fact, monetary compensation is only a factor when making major life decisions (e.g., whether and when to change jobs) and when there is a question of fairness. The best a manager can hope for, says Thomas, is perceived equity - that those doing the most and the best work are the best compensated. Absent major life decisions and inequities, it is intrinsic rewards that will motivate employees.Intrinsic motivation, according to Thomas, means giving employees an understanding of the purpose of the tasks they do and giving them whole tasks whenever possible. Today's workforce is more highly educated than its forerunners. Competition and the need for quick decision-making have reduced the reliance on middle managers and bureaucratic rulebooks. In this environment, employees must be self-managing and they must have a sense of meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress in the work that they do. If they feel that they have all four of these factors, employees will feel a great sense of job satisfaction, be highly motivated, and perform well.Thomas offers managers and employees suggestions on how to improve in each area if it seems that that factor is lacking. In fact, if an employee is feeling unmotivated, Thomas suggests the employee consider which of the four \\"vital signs\\" is weak and address it accordingly. It is important, for example, for employees at all levels to have a personal vision to boost their sense of meaningfulness. Feeling that you have no choice in how you do your work? Negotiate with your boss for more authority or, if all else fails, consider moving to another job that provides more choice. A sense of competence comes from training and learning, but it also comes from patting oneself on the back for a job well done. Progress can be measured in a number of ways, but one of the best is through contact with customers.Thomas's book is only an overview into each of these areas. He intends Intrinsic Motivation to be an all-encompassing model of employee motivation, and he generally succeeds. Those seeking more details would need to use Thomas's notes to find articles and books on individual subjects discussed within the book. And it is a shame that while Thomas characterizes outdated management styles as \\"paternalistic\\" he uses analogies of parents and children when describing intrinsic motivation. Overall, however, Intrinsic Motivation is a healthy reminder to both managers and workers that there are many steps we can take to improve employee morale and productivity. More money is better than less, Thomas agrees, but a true sense of purpose and worth can be priceless."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"I purchased Dr. Thomas' book to assist me in my research in leadership behaviors and stakeholder empowerment, and what a great help.However, the best part of reading this book, I was forced to remember much of my past training and reignite many of the qualities I had forgetten to practice.What a great book, would recommend to anyone interested in understand how and why motivation works."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"&quot;Intrinsic Motovation at Work&quot; is a must read for anyone responsible for managing people. This small book is in reality a giant guide book to help move us from just hanging a carrot out there for employees to chase, to giving them both a bit in their teeth and a hand on the reins."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"This book deserves more than five stars.Prior to Intrinsic Motivation at Work, management books often referred to the need for intrinsic motivation or sources of thta motivation (such as an inspiring purpose or interesting work). This book takes those isolated thoughts and connects them into a systematic method of improving overall motivation by increasing internal motivation and connecting with external sources of motivation. This book will be a landmark in the field of human resource management for decades to come.The book contains many helpful elements to help you understand its message. One that I particularly liked was the management tale. In one connected example, it showed how management attention has shifted in the last 120 years from making people perform more effectively at predefined tasks (the rational approach as defined by scientific management) to creating passion and fulfillment from work, by focusing on the emotional side of a person. You get an overview of management practice and theory in very small and easy-to-digest doses. For example, one of my favorite sentences was &quot;So the executives crafted Vision Statements that emphasized Contribution to Customers and Quality . . . but often [they] rang hollow in time -- like unkept promises.&quot;The author distills the relevant sources of intrinsic motivation into meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress. These ideas are nicely developed in several dimensions. For example, it is explained how these affect the worker (or associate, if you prefer that term). You also find out what the leader or manager has to do to help create those factors for the worker. Then, the author also exposes how the four areas are connected in a system of postive (or potentially negative) feedback. Further, you are given five elements of each one to develop.Basically, the model calls for the meaningful purpose of the organization as the starting point. The next step is to give people a choice of actions to implement that purpose. Then activities are performed, and these are monitored for the competency shown (which may generate the need for better choices to pursue the object or to enhance the competency of those involved). After the activities are completed, you also look for progress and relate this back to the original purpose and your choices for fulfilling that purpose.The book goes on the explain how to integrate intrinsic and external sources of motivation so that they reinforce one another.There are several points to keep in mind when considering this book. First, you will get even better results if the organization picks a meaningful purpose that offers the potential for more intrinsic motivation. Some purposes have more potential to be accomplished and some are more exciting to more people. I find that most people latch onto an organizational purpose with too little consideration of the alternatives. Second, any on-going organization has a perceived purpose that attracts and retains employees now. You should find out what that is before changing it. My experience has been that you get better results by building upon that assumed purpose than by striking off in a totally new direction. Third, simplification (see Simplicity) is a related thought process that should be employed with this one. A lot of demotivation along intrinsic lines follows errors in making things too complicated and difficult.Although this book is about work, its principles apply just as well to volunteer activities. I suggest that you share the book with those you volunteer with and then discuss how to employ its lessons to fulfill your empowering purposes."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"&quot;As I have written this book, I have tried to balance a number of goals&quot;. Kenneth W. Thomas writes, &quot;The first is to give you a solid conceptual framework for understanding intrinsic motivation and why it is vital to the new work. The problem is that most of us have already learned to think about motivation in rational-economic ways, so that kind of thinking seems solid to us, and other ways of thinking often seem 'soft'. I have tried to give intrinsic motivation that same kind of solidity by laying a firm conceptual foundation in Parts I and II of this book. Part I establishes the need for new models. It discusses the revolution in work, why extrinsic rewards are no longer enough, and the limitations of rational-economic thinking...Then Part II examines the essence of the new work in more detail, emphasizing how purpose has been reintroduced into that work. It discusses how workers are now being asked to self-manage in pursuit of purposes, and then lays out the key steps involved in self-management. Part III, the heart of the book, discusses the four intrinsic rewards that come from -and energize- those self-management steps: a sense of meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress&quot; (from the Preface).In this context, in Part III, he provides a diagnostic framework for intrinsic motivation. As the first step of this framework, in Chapter 6, he introduces (1) a complete map of the intrinsic rewards needed to reinforce self-management, and (2) a set of building blocks that are needed to produce each intrinsic reward. Hence, as the second step, in Chapters 7-10, he discusses each intrinsic reward in more detailed, along with actions to provide the building blocks.(1). The Four Intrinsic Rewardsi. A sense of 'Meaningfulness' is the opportunity you feel to pursue a worthy task purpose (more detailed discussion see Chapter 7).ii. A sense of 'Choice' is the opportunity you feel to select task activities that make sense to you and to perform them in ways that seem appropriate (more detailed discussion see Chapter 8).iii. A sence of 'Competence' is the accomplishment you feel in skillfully performing task activities you have choosen (more detailed discussion see Chapter 9).iv. A sense of 'Progress' is the accomplishment you feel in achieving the task purpose (more detailed discussion see Chapter 10).(2). Building Blocks for the Intrinsic Rewardsi. Meaningfulness: a non-cynical climate, clearly identified passions, an exciting vision, relevant task purposes, and whole tasks (more detailed discussion see Chapter 7).ii. Choice: delegated authority, trust in workers, security (no punishment for honest mistakes), a clear purpose, and information (more detailed discussion see Chapter 8).iii. Competence: knowledge, positive feedback, skill recognition, challenge, and high, non-comparative standards (more detailed discussion see Chapter 9).iv. Progress: a collaborative climate, milestones, celebrations, access to customers, and measurement of improvement (more detailed discussion see Chapter 10).Finally, he argues that &quot;To understand intrinsic motivation, it's important to see the limitations of the rational-economic model that dominated motivational thinking in the compliance era. At its heart, intrinsic motivation is not about rational calculation-it is about passion and the positive feelings that people get from their work. These feelings reinforce or energize workers' self-management efforts and also provide the fulfillment that is needed to keep today's workers on the job. Building intrinsic motivation, then, is about finding ways to enable and amplify those feelings&quot; (p.107).Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"As a teacher of leadership, organizational theory and psychological issues at work, at the undergraduate and graduate level, I can say that Ken's approach to intrinsic motivation is simply the best material available on the subject. The depth and clarity of his presentation is remarkable. Whenever I present his model to a class or in a workshop the model Ken has developed clicks immediately with people and they are instantly engaged. His model captures what so many other authors and approaches have tried to present, but have fallen short. &quot;Intrinsic Motivation at Work&quot; will immediately become a required text in my courses and at the top of my most highly recommended books to anyone interested in motivation at work. His approach is well researched and documented but still immediately accessible to non-academics. This book will find broad readership because of it's usefullness to those in supervisory and leadership roles, as well as those who are simply trying to create a more motivating work environment for themselves. Please buy and read this book! There is nothing better available. This is the best there is on motivation."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"Kenneth W. Thomas presents a model for using intrinsic motivation in the workplace to assure a more committed, self-managed workforce. He advocates leading for meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress. He emphasizes the need to use this approach to give employees the greater independence and decision-making authority they need as bureaucratic management models break down. While many of these themes are presented in other books on leadership, motivation, training and worker empowerment, Thomas pulls them together in a well-organized, clearly written presentation that gives readers clear directions. The succinct style of writing is easy to understand, even though it is directed toward the serious reader. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers, trainers and management consultants, as well as to employees, who will find helpful ideas for exercising greater self-management."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"&quot;Intrinsic Motivation at Work&quot; is a must read for anyone responsible for managing people. This small book is in reality a giant guide book to help move us from just hanging the carrot out there for employees to chase, to giving them both a bit in their teeth and a hand on the reins."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"Thomas is well know to academics because his conflict theory is the dominant theory in textbooks of organizational theory and behavior. His theory of empowerment also is becoming dominant, because it has demonstrated empirical validity. He is a clear, careful theorist and researcher.What a wonderful bonus this his disciplined mind is also able to inspire and offer practical insights for leaders. This is because his research leads to an better understanding of human nature. Check out the table of contents and you will see what I mean when I say this book gets at the foundations for best practices that have emerged in leadership and human resource management. It is rich in ideas and practical advice for high involvement organizations &amp; their leaders."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"This is the first book that I have read that provides me with the information to confront the problems associated with instilling intrinsic motivation in those that I manage. It is often the problem that people show little concern for their work. The rule seems to be something like this- Do just enough to get by while exerting the least energy as possible. I like this book because the information is not a story of what a good manager has as an opinion as to what works best but it is a scholarly book in the sense that it provides information based on research that is proven. This is to date the best book that I have to reference when dealing with teams that act out of extrinsic motivation or no motivation at all. I applaud the author for this work."},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"This book is a great overview on the basics of motivation and it goes deeper by probing well into the aspects of intinsic motivation.

If you want to really understand employee motivation, read this book! It's terrific!"},{"Title":"Intrinsic Motivation at Work: Building Energy and Commitment","review":"The old way of motivating staff does not work in times of constant change.

Clark strongly denounces communism. He comes to the realization that communists can not be reasoned with, and that force, or the threat of the use of force, is the only way to deal with them. He also is dismayed when he comes to the realization that the Truman and Eisenhower administration do not have a plan for victory, but only a prolonged stalemate. In the book he states, \\"It was beyond my comprehension that we would countenance a situation in which Chinese soldiers killed American youths in organized, formal warfare and yet we would fail to use all the power at our command to protect those Americans.\\" When he realizes we are not there to win, Gen. Clark does everything in his power to sign an armistice and safeguard the soldiers under his command.This is a good book, but I only gave it 3 stars because there are numerous pages spent on repatriation of prisoners. This happened under his command, but it was not interesting to read.Gen. MacArthur was right when he said there is no substitute for victory. Gen. Clark also sums it up best when he states, \\"The Armistice was obtained and I signed it....But I had grave misgivings that some day my countrymen would be forced to pay a far higher price in blood than it would have cost if the decision had been made to defeat the communists in Korea.\\" I believe that day is fast approaching when what we thought was a gentle dragon in communist China, will actually be a belligerent dragon intent on our destruction."},{"Title":"From the Danube to the Yalu","review":"This book should be listed more correctly under Mark Clark, Mark Wayne Clark, General Mark Clark or General Mark Wayne Clark. NOT Mark General Clark. In the forties and early fifties, Mark Clark was as famous as General as H. Norman Schwartzkof. Mark Clark was the best friend of Ike and was one of the great egos like Marine Generals Holland Smith and AA Vandergrift who are forgotten today because no movie like Patton or McArthur or Chesty were made for them. Clark was in charge of Africa and Italy and became the Governor General of Austria during the occupation. Although Ridgway replaced McArthur in Korea, it was the more senior Clark who was called on for the armistice. He never received a fifth star. Most probably because he was blamed for the heavy casualties he took at Anzio. I am too young to know. This is an excellent book. He also wrote &quot;Calculated Risk.&quot; He was at Ike's bedside during the last days talking of the old days at West Point. He died in 1984 a couple miles from my home in Northwestern Michigan."},{"Title":"From the Danube to the Yalu","review":"In this first person account of the final stages of the Korean War, General Mark W. Clark, Commander of United Nations Forces in Korea, narrates the difficulty of negotiating with the Communists at Panmunjom while simultaneously dealing with Washington and South Korean President Syngman Rhee. In doing so, he paints a prophetic picture of cold war political relations that would last for the next forty years.Clark came to Korea after a successful campaign in Italy in World War II. He soon found Korea was a different story. The enemy was granted sanctuaries from which he could strike without fear of retaliation due to political restrictions, violating every principle of war. Future wars waged under the same restrictions would produce similarly results. Military and diplomatic planners for Vietnam would have profited by reading this work.Washington wanted the war ended as soon as possible. South Korean President Syngman Rhee's answer to an armistice that would leave his country divided was, \\"Never!!\\" Clark agreed with Rhee but knew America had selected a no win strategy. An armistice that preserved half of Korea was the best he could do. Today, Korea remains a divided country with armed forces facing each other over battle lines drawn in 1953. Hopefully, Rhee's dream of a free, united Korea will eventually be realized to the benefit of people North and South of the 38th Parallel.This short book, written only a few months after the armistice was signed, showed exactly how the Communists would conduct themselves in the future. William Westmoreland, Creighton Abrams and Henry Kissinger would be subjected to the same tactics in the field and at the negotiating table later. We owe much to men such as Clark who fought an inhuman foe on the battlefield and at the peace table to preserve freedom for as many as possible.Today, it is common practice to denounce the \\"cold war\\" mentality that, some say, led us into Vietnam. This book effectively shows that cold war fears had a very real basis in fact. Young readers who have not and will not grow up under the threat of a nuclear holocaust and are looking for an answer to why we spent billions to defend against the reds should read this work. The threat was both significant and real. This and other incidents proved it."},{"Title":"How to Speak Politely & Why","review":"An important book for kids as they are learning language.

My son is only two and a half, so I figured this would be relegated to a shelf for a few years. I red it the night I bought it and figured that was it. Imagine my surprise when he began to ask for it every few nights! The pictures are simple and not very colorful. There is no excitement or set plot.

Every parent should have a copy of each of these great books to share and pass down to their children.

Instead it's full of rules about saying \\"VERB-ing\\" rather than \\"VERB-in\\" so poor G doesn't get lonely. It uses cutesy little things like that, and poor wobbly-necked \\"Uh-uh\\" and \\"Uh-huh\\" to nag kids in an annoying way about how to speak \\"correct\\" English.

Kurtz, in his memoir of being a PK, tells that he was far from perfect, i.e., he was a normal kid.Years ago it was common practice that the preacher and his family live in the church-owned parsonage (never owning their own home, just moving from parsonage to parsonage).Father, the preacher was busy serving his congregation, preparing sermons and tending the ill and dying. Mother was busy worrying about \\"what the members will think about ___,\\" forcing the family to be on display all the time. Hey, I grew up in that time and I remember how members would talk about the preacher's wife clothing, their car, how the kids acted--as if we all were their supervisors. Whew, that must have been hard for the family members.Mom ruled the house but relied on Dad for a firm word of discipline. Their supper table (evening meal) stories took me back to a time when everyone was at this meal--no sports practices or games, no lessons, no time classes, just family-first priority.Amusing and heartwarming romp through this family's life at Christmas time, where everything evolved around this special season.Armchair Interviews says that with a reminiscing sense of humor, Kurt brings nostalgia to your heart and mind. It is an ideal gift for someone who grew up when the author did, early 50s and shared the situations. It's also a good reminder to all of us of family togetherness, another way grandparents can share their growing-up life with their grandkids."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"This is the best SF book I have ever read! The world of Palace is absolutely unique, the characters solid and believeable, the plot rich and exciting, and to crown it all, the actual writing is superb! I really love a story that depicts not only the events through the eyes of the characters, but also the ethical issues, the &quot;good and evil&quot;. What is more is that there are no unnecissary people involved. Each character has a stake in the story, now or later in forthcoming novels: nothing is left over for slop. There is not a single character that I did not like, or at least empathize with (except Wan!), even Kata. I really hated him, yet one cannot help but feel with him! Vanna too. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel (Eyes of God, unfortunately out of print. Mark Kreighbaum does have a few copies availible on his website for interested parties, by the way). What will happen to Vida and Rico? Pero, Damo and Barra? Not to mention Molos, Kata's brother. He knows more than he's telling! And of course Vanna. She's up to something!

WE NEED MORE PALACE BOOKS!"},{"Title":"Palace","review":"I've been rather bored with books lately, there are too many that are too similar to each other, but this one really caught my interrest. It has an intricate, well thought-out plot, fascinating characters and a society which feels alive - but...! It left too many loose ends.So I went to look for information about this book on the net, and behold, there is indeed a sequel. Though I'm glad there's more, I just whish I'd known beforehand it wasn't a stand-alone novel since who knows how long before I get my hands on the next one?I truly recommend reading Palace, but make sure you have the sequel as well - this is a &quot;to be continued&quot;-book in my opinion."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"Vida, a girl raised from birth to become a prostitute, is suddenly revealed to be the long-lost heir to a very valuable noble family. She is betrothed immediately to the son of the First Citizen (aka president) and meanwhile has to dodge murder at the hands of an infamous assassin known as the Outlaw.There never was a clear plot in this novel. What makes this book unusual is that there was never any particular goal that the main characters were striving towards - aside from Vida's goal to stay alive, of course. There was never a plan to save the world, win a war, rescue someone, escape from something, or anything like that. Rather, this book was more like a snapshot of a futuristic (but very primitive in many ways) society, shown from the viewpoints of many characters, of which Vida was only the most prominent.I liked the setting of the book. There were certain details I picked up on quickly and wondered where they originated from - such as the fact that most character names seemed to originate from Spanish, and that gender-based titles had disappeared so that everyone was called \\"Se\\" (the 'se' from 'senor' or 'senorita'). There was also a fascinating history alluded to in little fragments here and there, including ancient religious wars called \\"schizms\\", a new religious order, other planets neighbouring this world, other intelligent races, and so on. Yes, as far as setting was concerned, it was very original.But - and it's a big but - this originality was also, indirectly, the book's biggest flaw. The problem was that all these fascinating details weren't explained. There were whole segments of the book that I could only partially understand. Even though the terminology was possible to grasp from context after a while, there was a mountain of cultural information referred to that simply lacked enough context to be understood properly. It's as if the whole book was written for omniscient readers who already knew all about this universe. There were countless examples, so I'll just list some of the most prominent here:1. The \\"Map\\". This seemed to be some kind of computer system, perhaps like the internet, but possibly also a virtual reality system. There was a whole swag of jargon associated with this that was very difficult to pick up, and no background information with which to put it into context. There were many pages devoted to hacking activities in the map, but they meant very little to me, because it was never explained what the purpose of the Map was. Was it a security system? A communications network? A purely economic thing for business and banking (which were briefly mentioned)? I have no idea. Apparently drugs were needed to access the Map - but again, no explanation why. It's an utterly bewildering example of how there could be chapters worth of information about something and yet I could still have no idea what it actually did. The best assumption I could make was that it was a place for storing information, like the internet - but it was horribly vague. Instead of technical jargon, a few paragraphs of basic explanation in layman's terms would have achieved so much more (and more efficiently).2. History. Scraps of history kept being referred to - like the Schizm wars - but were never explained, even briefly, or explained in a way that used more obscure jargon than the original statement. (It's like looking up a new word in a thesaurus, only to find that you don't recognise any of the synonyms, either!) I wanted to know about religion, about the planets, about all the tempting little tidbits that were thrown my way - but nothing was ever offered, and thus I struggled through the book without really understanding the events in context.3. The political system. Same as above.4. The city/planet itself. The title of this book is called \\"Palace\\", which referred to the book's setting. However, even at the end of 430 pages, I am still unable to tell you whether \\"Palace\\" was the name of a city or the whole planet. I thought it was the name of the planet at first, though I had to make an assumption because this was never directly shown. But then there was a scene where characters were describing the \\"edge\\" of Palace; that it clearly had a border, which threw me off balance. So, is it a planet, or just a city on a planet? I honestly have no idea. This is seriously basic information that every reader should know, authors! Come on! Similarly, there was something called the \\"Pinch\\" (this book is \\"a novel of the Pinch\\", for instance), and I have no idea what that is, either. A union of planets is my best guess, but I don't know. Why were such vastly important details left out?5. \\"Revenants\\". Contrary to the name, which sounds like a mythological creature, it was clear that these creatures had something to do with computers ('the Map', that is). But as to what, I haven't a clue. They seemed like servants at first, or guides, but they might have been the computers themselves, or just part of computers... and there were different types (ancient, superior ones, and normal, modern ones), and the difference between those wasn't explained either.Practically everything else in the book was like this, too. It was just vague, despite being full of detail. All the minor details were there, yes, but the major ones - the ones that make sense of everything and put it into the bigger picture - were completely missing. It's no use describing the habits of cats to an alien visitor if they don't know what a cat is to start with. First, you need to show that a cat is an animal, what it looks like, what its most important traits are, and so on. Without a context, the rest is useless information.Back to the events of the story now, I mostly enjoyed them. There were many overused cliches in here, such as the long-lost heir (particularly with superior inherited traits), the dramatic rise to status and power all of a sudden, and the irredeemable villains who liked to torture and rape - but there were also some fascinating issues such as the impact of racism on various factions and the power plays of various groups to achieve their own profitable ends. Characterisation was mostly good, with the exception of Vida, a blatant Mary Sue (nicer than everyone else, outstandingly beautiful, superior genetics, nobility, brains, power, influence, charm, etc etc etc). I actually liked Vida, however, because she was very logical and practical about her situation, and did pretty much exactly what I would have done in her position. Most heroines lack any sense of rationality, but not her. She's one of the few Mary Sues I've read that actually comes across as the decent person she's set up to be.One very overused cliche present in \\"Palace\\" was that of the unwilling arranged marriage (especially since the characters were basically the likewise overused equivalents of prince and princess). Normally this really puts me off a book, but I thought this one was handled well. For one thing, Vida wasn't all emotional and illogical like most stereotypical heroines (yay Vida!). She realised she had a lot to gain, that love wasn't the be-all-and-end-all, and she was actually accepting of the marriage (without being hardened and cynical, which was very refreshing).Overall, however, this book was just far too vague. Although it was interesting and addictive, it was simply impossible to understand what was going on in anywhere near the depth I wanted. Basic infomation that should have been shown to the readers was completely missing. This could have been a great book, but without context I'll never have a hope of translating the jargon and setting into meaningful terms. What I want to know is basic things like: What IS the Map? What ARE revenants? What do they actually DO? What is their PURPOSE? Telling me that files are stored in a cache on a grid inside a Gate on the fifth level behind a meta that can only be accessed by a drug-using cybermaster in the form of an abstract concept or an ancient revenant with the das dev genotype of the L'Vars is complete gibberish without it. But that's the kind of thing you can expect from this book. If you can understand it, you're obviously much smarter than I.I have to give this one two stars. I want to give it more, I really want to. There's a lot of potentially fantastic material in it, along with a great story. But what use is a great story when a reader can't understand it? Context is so important."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"Mark Kreighbaum adds some excellent spice to the skilled writing of Katharine Kerr. Many authors whose books I have seen in collaboration end up with fairly dull, long-winded essays through which I can hardly plough. This book is entertaining, philosophical, topical and techinical. I have recommended this book to almost all of my literate friends."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"This is one of the best 4 or 5 fantansy novels that I've read in the last 3 or so years. The characters are interesting and engaging, and the world feels like it has layers of culture and history. Seems to be lots of material for additional novels. The main problem I spotted is that the main female character is so much a male fantasy that it might annoy female readers."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"Although Palace left little impression on the SF community, I regard it as one of the most solid, entertaining and innovative SF novels of its generation. The Hugo and Nebula Awards fell down on this one. Palace effortlessly juggles many SF archetypes in a way that's really fresh. The novel previsions trending social topics voted on in real time by citizens of the city in a media context.There's mysteries galore in Palace that involve a technological past, a lost heritage and what it means to the entire civilization, a mysterious terrorist, the nature of Palace itself, cyberattacks and more.But Palace isn't good because of the nature of what it chooses to deal with, it's good because it's streamlined, well written and without any nods to faux artistry or political correctness. It's just good, just about as good as any SF novel you'll read. The characters are distinct and believable."},{"Title":"Palace","review":"Usually indifferent to reading books written by more than one author, I was more than pleasantly surprised when I began Palace. This book flowed in a way that co-authorship does not usually allow.Although the first two chapters made it harder to get into, once I perservered I found that this story was fantastic and I really enjoyed it - science fiction, action, romance, mystery all in one.

I had heard alot of stuff about Frost tradition wicca, and I just thought that it was wrong, plain and simple.For example, when a young girl becomes of age and is ready to be initiated, she is ritually deflowered? UGH. All the talk about phalluses made me queasy.And the handfasting ceremonies in this deal with the bride and groom cutting themselves and then mixing their blood? Sounds just downright DANGEROUS to me.I don't practice fluffy bunny stuff by a LONG shot, but I want nothing to do with these wierd and creepy rituals. JMO"},{"Title":"The witch's bible,","review":"Before the fluffy bunny wicca of Silver Ravenpoof, there was WICCA. REAL WICCA, with hair growing out of it! The Frosts were the pioneers of wicca in America, peddling their \\"Magic Power of Witchcraft\\" book in comic books with ads for Sea Monkeys. If you wanted to study wicca back in the 1970's, you went to the Frosts books or mail order school. There really wasn't much else out there. This whole idea of the Frost's Wicca being an \\"abberation\\" is ludicrous. For a while, it WAS WICCA, period. The publisher of TWB went bankrupt shortly after its publication (who says Witchcraft isn't bad luck?), and it has been re-published and retitled as \\"The Good Witch's Bible\\", which only makes the book's title ironic when you read it.OK, now I'll let the book speak for itself. I'm quoting from the new edition. Page 73 (a description of a wedding ritual) :The woman cuts the man's forearm so that she draws blood. (The easiest way to produce the necessary cut is to pinch the flesh with one hand and cut with the other.) ... Man and woman each cut themselves; the man allows his blood to fall on hers.[If all the sex doesn't give you AIDS, that one ritual should]Page 159 says:\\"It is inherent in Wicca belief that marriage is mainly a matter of the mind, not of sex. Can you allow the woman you live with to have sex with another in the perfect faith that she will return to you and you will feel more, not less, loving toward her? This tenet is obviously the reverse of the Judeo-Christian [sic] 'thou shalt not.'...our rule is that twice a year every male and female in the coven will live with a female or male other than the spouse for one full lunar month. It is usual for the males to change homes, though in many cases, if more convenient, the women agree to change.\\"[So, wife swapping is part of Wicca, even if they don't call it this! ]Page 66 \\"The physical attributes of male and female virginity are destroyed at the youngest possible age, either by the mother or by a doctor. In the female case, the hymen is painlessly broken surgically. In the male case, the mother makes absolutely sure that the foreskin can be drawn fully back by cutting the underside attachment membrane\\"[But even more twisted are the following instructions on how to deflower a girl who wasn't born into Wicca. It is done at menstration, which happens around age 11 or 12.]Page 66:\\"At the last sabbat or eshbat before the initiation, the female novice is given the sacred phallus and the instruction sheet in Table 5 so that she can learn to insert and remove the phallus quickly and comfortably. She is also taught how she should lie and what she should do during the initiation ceremony...Throughout the fast the female novice wears her phallus, and at some time during the fast the novices are given a demonstration of introitus by a couple selected by the coven. The novice makes her own decision on contraception or lack of it. If she needs advice or help, the sponsor is the one to give it. (The IUD is the recommended Wicca preventive.)\\"[So little girls get a live demonstration by an adult couple on how to use a dildo! And why do underage girls need contraceptives if no one is having sex with them?]Table 5 are the instructions to be given for the deflowering pubescent Wiccan girls: \\"You have been entrusted with two phalli; these are in our care until your initiation. We would like you to be initiated at the next coven meeting, which will take place on ... This means that, excluding your menstruation time, you have three weeks to prepare your muscles for introitus. Your father or your sponsor will help you if you have any difficulties or pain.\\"[On page 99 are the instructions for making the dildo! So a father raping his daughter with a didlo is part of Wicca!Suddenly stories about Satanic Ritual Abuse aren't so far fetched, huh?]There's really a lot more I could have mentioned. It's practically impossible to open this book to any page and find something that won't offend somebody! There is racist stuff about black people being better at Wicca because they talk to spirits, Asians are better too, while whites are slow, so covens should be segregated at least at first. Christ got his powers by gay oral sex. The family unit is to be disolved and replaced by the coven. Kids are to spend once a month with a different family (for God only knows what!). Kids are to learn everything about sex at the earliest possible age with nothing held back, \\"no bird or bees\\". This is so Wiccan kids won't be raised like Christian kids who are raised as \\"repressed perverts\\" as the author puts it! Yes, it is one of the vilest books ever written! PLEASE, SOMEBODY BUY COPIES FOR BOB LARSON AND RUSH LIMBAUGH! LOL! It's been in print in some form or another for 30 years. Somebody out there must be doing these crazy things! BUY THIS BOOK AND GIVE A DOSE OF REALITY TO THAT WICCA CURIOUS TEEN! BUY IT FOR YOUR MINISTER, YOUR LOCAL CHIEF OF POLICE, THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES! The possibilites are endless!

This book and CD are the most helpful tools in preparing for the test. I worked 5 years in insurance (underwriting) but did not sell insurance so I never needed to be licensed (FYI- underwriting thinks they know more than agents). Figured my job prepared me for the test- NO. This CD practice tests are what prepared me- there is so much information that you will never use but will be on the test.Before you test, you need to have your credits- most people get them from going to class. I did Kaplan self-study, which provides a book that is state specific and a test to take about your self-study. If you pass that test then they give you the required credits. Then you sign up for the testing site to get your actual license.When other reviews say that this is not state specific, you need to understand that every state is different and you need to rely on your textbook for your state (provided by your class or self-study). The actual TEST- will have a few questions that are state specific but the majority of the questions are ones that are general and covered by this book & CD.I did the practice exams from the CD and was scoring in the 50% range...what this has to be wrong. I kept doing them over & over, the questions were the same word for word but the test always was different changing questions and orders. I must have taken 100 practice tests. When I was scoring in the 90% range- I went to the testing site. So surprised that as I'm taking the test, the questions were word for word from the practice tests...it was just like the CD regenerated a new test for me and I was flying through it. I PASSED, 1st time. After the test, I waited in line to get finger printed and process the paperwork. Everyone was talking about how many tries it took them (most were 3rd time), you also see people walking out really mad (didn't pass). The others in line thought it was because I worked in underwriting that I passed but really nothing that I actually used in day to day work was on that test. It was like I took this test 100 times already (so not fair to say I passed the first time- without this I would have gotten 50%).GOOD LUCK!!"},{"Title":"Property and Casualty Insurance License Exam Cram","review":"Very well written.

The author consistently allowed the soldiers to explain in their own words their experiences of patrolling in small recon/ fighting units within smelling distance of the enemy and often undetected. The book explains how the unit operated in closeknit teams and how the unit successfully adapted to the varying roles it was to perform from long range recon patrols to aggressive ambushes. It was also a personal pleasure for me to read Nev Farley's detailed contributions as a patrol commander. I had the honor of serving with Nev Farley in the early 80's when he was the Regimental Sergent Major of my battalion. His military professionalism was an inspiration to all soldiers who had the honor to be associated with him.

This book takes you through selection and training of patrol members, preparation and execution of patrols in Borneo, New Guinea, and Vietnam. This book spares no detail of operational patrols, from the warning order to mission debrief, it is all covered here. The book reads more like a how-to book highlighted with actual accounts of mission debriefs, this is just a treasure of lessons learned, that still apply today.

None of them comment on the link between the title \\"Santa's Toy Shop\\" and the acknowledgement of Walt Disney. What's the connection?I am speculating, but with some confidence.As with many other Walt-Disney credited Little Golden Books, the book is directly based on an earlier Walt Disney Studio cartoon or film. In this case, I believe the cartoon original is \\"Santa's Workshop\\", an early entry in the so called \\"Silly Symphonies\\" series, in the early 1930s.I have a vague childhood memory of having seen this, and other early Disney cartoons, in the late 1950s on TV in Australia, possibly even in episodes of \\"The Mickey Mouse Club\\" show, or an episode of the \\"Disneyland\\" show. But I am aware that Terry Toons also produced similar animations, with crowd-scenes, and vigorous dolls parading and playing. I may be misremembering seeing either a Disney cartoon or a Terry Toon (the inspiration for the \\"Animaniacs\\" series!).But Little Golden Books would be bound to get the copyright and acknowledgment right -- it's Disney. They may not acknowledge \\"Santa's Workshop\\" as the source, but that can be checked in an old LGB copy.I usually only have access to Australian reprints of USA originals, and the reprinting may have omitted details from the USA original edition. However I am surprised to find that my own copy is the USA edition: \\"Illustrations by the Walt Disney Studio. Adapted by Al Dempster: Copyright 1950\\". But NO mention of \\"Santa's Workshop\\".This brings me to another point: it is lamentable that editors at Little Golden Books think they can silently change the TEXT of a classic story, and think they can get away with it. Please scrap the rewrites and substitutes, and reinstate the great originals.Consider the Al Dempster opening:Page 1: Way up north in the land of ice and snow stands a cozy little house. And beside the front door hangs a neat little sign. \\"S.Claus\\", says the sign. Because that is who lives there -- Santa Claus.Page 2: Mrs Santa Claus lives there, too, of course. She keeps house for Santa Claus, and for all the elves who work in Santa's toy shop. And what a busy place that toy shop is!This is followed by a visual catalogue of the departments in the toy shop: dolls, trains, games and building (the illustration includes the great cartoon joke of painting a checker-board with a single brush that paints red-and-black checkers!), and so on.(Note the USA way that \\"shop\\" means \\"place of manufacture\\", as in metal-shop, carpentry-shop -- not \\"store\\", where the manufactures are sold. Hence the fact that the cartoon got the title a little clearer -- \\"Workshop\\".)And the final page:-- Do you think he might pick your house to stop at this year?Yes, Santa! Please stop at MY house! I'll leave you cookies and milk! You can play at at my house!John Gough -- Deakin University -- jugh@deakin.edu.au"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Santa's Toy Shop","review":"My four year old discovered the magic of Santa Claus through this charming book.

Bird was the premier woman traveler of the Victorian age and author Pat Barr competently tells the story of her life.Isabella Bird, a short, plump English gentlewoman of unimpeachable character, acquired an incurable wanderlust about age 40 and during the next 30 years traveled and wrote books about her visits to Hawaii, Colorado, Japan, Malaya, India, Persia, Korea, and China. Isabella traveled mostly by herself, except for interpreters and local helpers. She sought out the lonely places of the world in long journeys that were near epics of adventure and hardship. At home in Scotland she was frail; on the trail she was as hardy as a bristlecone pine.The author gets most of her material directly from Isabella's many books of her travels plus an earlier biographer. Lacking in depth, \\"Curious Life\\" makes up for it with easy to read, well-organized writing, letting Isabella Bird tell much of the story with quotes from her books and letters. Reading this biography can be a substitute for reading Isabella's books, some of which run to a formidable 600 pages. However, I recommend reading \\"A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains\\" by Bird which is a classic of Western Americana.It is from this book and her letters that the author has reconstructed the interesting tale of Isabella and her romance in Colorado in 1873 with a charming desperado named \\"Rocky Mountain Jim\\" Nugent. Jim wooed 41-year old Isabella and almost won her heart but, conscious of the proprieties, she resisted his entreaties and moved along to other adventures -- apparently without surrendering her virtue. Drat! Jim was killed in a gunfight not long after Isabella left Colorado -- the victim one might imagine of a broken heart.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-Four: Past, Present, and Future (Twayne's Masterwork Studies)","review":"Patrick Reilly takes masterpieces and offers a critical reading of them. He takes 1984 and strips it down to the basic story. In other words, he treats it just like any other story, discussing the work, breaking down the work, as if you would do with any other story. To him, the story is about Jack the Giant Killer, but this Jack fails and fails big time, against a Giant who is smarter, more powerful and always two steps ahead.

Why, well first of all the supposed religious retreat is called 'Heavens Gate' and those of us that are familiar with the real Heavens Gate thing in the usa with DO and RE and MI, the leaders brings visions of simpleton idiots that were waiting for their spaceship to come. Nothing and I mean NOTHING erotic about that, matter of fact, every time I read the reference to Heavens Gate it jerked me into a reality I hope to escape from while reading an erotic book.Contrary to the main Black Lace themes of strong women taking what they want out of life, the heroine in this book, Mary Grace, does little to show any strength and is a far cry from other heriones in the genre.

It appears to have been reprinted by a computer scan. At least, there was no care taken in the proof-reading of this fine-appearing book. It has been produced on good paper with an artistic, shiny cover. Unfortunately, nearly every page has several errors which can be merely distracting or can completely change the meaning of the text. I bought this as a gift, but could never give it as a gift. Some examples: p.84-\\"...could spend the whole morning cleaning but (out) someone's pigs\\"; p.128-\\"...Angus left them to their desert (dessert)\\"; P.130, quoting a poem-\\"'And now I hold heaven dose (close) clasped to my breast'\\"; p. 137-\\" 'Judith, how can I? The dan (clan) marches tonight.'\\"; p. l42-\\"...given her on August l8th, l74J\\". One of the worst, possibly, was on p.106- \\"'sounds like the devil rolling his bath rub (bathtub) round hell'\\". In addition, there are many cases of punctuation errors, especially exclamation points which are rendered as the letter \\"l\\" or the number \\"1\\", and words are italicized when there appears no reason for emphasis.

This one fits that pattern well!A story beautifully woven together that shows hope fulfilled."},{"Title":"The Middle Window","review":"Goudge's SECOND novel, The Middle Window, published in 1935, is unusual in being two linked stories, one set in modern Scotland, the other in Scotland at the time of the Bonny Prince Charlie rebellion of 1745.Young Judy Cameron from London, recently affianced to a stuffed-shirt, meets the impoverished laird of Glen Suilag, Ian Macdonald, and experiences a tragedy from that earlier time.Is she haunted, or is she a reincarnation of Judith, who married Randald Macdonald, the laird and clan chief, on the day when the heather bursts into flame?Goudge was fascinated by the idea of reincarnation, despite her own strong Christian faith.What was read, when it was published in 1935, as whimsical speculation, has become standard time-slip fantasy fare for Young Adult (YA) readers since Phillipa Pearce's \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\".Few earlier books used such a theme: Margaret Irwin's \\"Still She Wished For Company\\", a neglected romance-historical-ghost novel published in 1924, is one example. Perhaps, as with Hope Mirrlees' remarkable supernatural fantasy \\"Lud-in-the-Mist\\", published in 1926, the grief for the lost generation of World War I was an explanation for stories in which star-crossed lovers of an earlier era connect with, and find redemption in the happiness of their inheritors.Interestingly, a very similar Scottish islands story, at the end of World War II, became the Michael Powell and Emerich Pressberger film, \\"I Know Where I'm Going\\".There are, too, hints of Wagner's legend of \\"The Flying Dutchman\\" -- redemption through love and sacrifice by another.In her reflective autobiographical memoir \\"The Joy of Snow\\", Goudge describes her own eerie experiences on the remote heathers of the Isle of Skye, during a walking holiday.Highly recommended.John Gough -- Deakin University - jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"The Middle Window","review":"For so long this book was out of print.

They focus their report upon the capture of Hank Blood and Bety Olsen, two American missionaries, and Mike Benge, a USAID agricultural advisor.Falsely identified as U.S. Military collaborators, the three were chained together and force marched through the jungle for many months. The most relentless enemy proved to be malnutrition, as the captives were denied basic food necessities and medical care. Debilitation took its toll as first Hank, then Betty, died an agonizing death on the trail...but not before their unwavering courage and forgiving love for their persecutors touched Mike Benge's heart, and he found new faith in God.Eventually released from a Hanoi prison camp, Benge has told his story to the authors of No Time For Tombstones.

She was only 10 years old. She has done her time in a prison for 5 and a half years. Jennifer has been released and has to try and put her past behind her. Only Jennifer's probation officer Jill and reporter friend Rosie know the truth. The novel follows Jennifer as she tries to make a new life for herself. The book was very thought provoking. In today's society we never really know who is around us. They may be hiding a big secret, and who knows how they may react when the secret comes out. I would only recommend the book to mature readers. There are adults theme and violence in the book."},{"Title":"Looking for JJ","review":"How well do you know the people around you? How do you know they are not hiding a huge secret like their past?This is the second book I've read recently that casts light on how murderers who are children fit into society after serving time for their crime. Anne Cassidy's new book, LOOKING FOR JJ, will keep your interest until the very end. Not only does the author give details about what happened but she lays the framework as to possible causes of why it happened -- because that is just as important. I actually found myself feeling sorry for Jennifer, the girl who committed the crime, wishing it hadn't happened to her.Michele Livingstone is dead. She died six years ago at the hands of her friend, JJ. Jennifer Jones has paid for what happened to Michele. There is no denying that Jennifer is responsible for Michele's death, but while reading the book I came to the conclusion that she wasn't the only one to blame. Is there one thing that controls when and how aggressive someone becomes? I really believe that genetic factors may contribute to behavior, but if a child is engaging in delinquent behavior it is probably due to peer influences and lapses in parenting.Jen's home life while growing up wasn't exactly the \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" atmosphere. Her mom certainly wouldn't win any parenting awards and from an early age Jen learned how to get by on her own, alone. Craving love, it is understandable that Jennifer had anger issues. The question is can people change? Can violent deeds of the past be forgiven with the passage of time?Jennifer is about to be released from jail and the press has made it front page news once again. Is JJ still a danger to other children? Where is she going to live now? Will the family of the dead girl try to get revenge?Alice Tully, like everyone else, follows the stories in the paper with keen interest. The only thing is that Alice knows something no one else does. She knows where Jennifer Jones is. Only three other people know her whereabouts. What is the connection between Alice Tully and Jennifer Jones? Why does Alice live in constant fear? Who is Alice Tully exactly?

Cassidy is able to show clearly how Jennifer, who was basically a normal child with a kind heart, could be driven to kill. Neglected and ignored by everyone in her life, Jennifer never felt any sense of belonging until she became friends with Michelle and Lucy. When those relationships were threatened, she lashed out. I believe the murder was actually a desperate attempt to keep the friendship together.Jennifer/Alice's redemption, and the difficulties she faces in her new life, are also very well portrayed. She will have to live with her guilt for the rest of her life, and will have to hide from the press. She may never be able to form lasting relationships.I think this would be a good book for people to read who think that all murderers must be monsters. In truth, any of us, pushed hard enough, could turn into a killer."},{"Title":"Looking for JJ","review":"JF: Looking for JJ (YA) (5/5)Looking for JJ tells the story of Jennifer Jones, who killed her best friend when she was 10 years old.

Later that day, only two of them came back.\\"Looking for JJ by Anne Cassidy was one of those books you can not put down. Looking for JJ is a fiction story that takes you through Jennifer Jones's life. This story takes place in Corydon, England. This story tells the life of Alice Tully or Jennifer Jones. Jennifer is forced to change her name after a horrible incident 6 years before. Jennifer finally has a normal life, well as normal as it could be. Then one detective comes to town and it will rip her new life apart. The theme of this book is that a secret is never a secret forever. This is the theme of the story because Jennifer has a huge secret that could be life or death, and sooner than later her secret came out! Alice Tully has a boyfriend and when he finds out about her past he freaks out and throws their whole relationship away. Alice also has Rosie who I guess is kind of like her new guardian and they are really close. Rosie is like a mother Alice never had. Personally I think that this book is a good book I would defiantly recommend this book to middle school and above readers. I also think this book is very confusing at times, but overall a outstanding story, with a really bad ending. \\"Three children walked away from the cottages on the edge of town toward Berwick Waters.

It wasn't about the JJ I know, as I first thought it might be.I thought the book was rather interesting, but it was written to a junior high level audience; except, some of the content seemed a bit beyond that age group (but not as bad as some TV). And some of the behavioral patterns of the main character just seemed to be inconsistent---being such a caring person, then such a jerk. A single event in JJ's life destroys her childhood, then she is reformed; but she can not get her life back.The story seems to be telling young teens that mistakes in life can be forgiven and won't destroy you, so get back on your feet. While at the same time, it seems to be telling young teens not to make a mistake because your life will be ruined forever, and you will need to live in obscurity.

The extra tools alone pay for the book - he includes Curves and demonstrates how valuable this is. He also has tools to give you great photo frames, etc, with a few quick moves. If you are willing to put in hours learning to achieve his results you will be very happy with this book. If you simply wish a basic beginning book on Elements this is NOT the book for you.

Like Adams' books, The Negative and The Print, Lynch offers photographers a technical vocabulary and systematic approach which disciplines and liberates visual imagination, not just a list of tricks and special effects.Every time I think of a tool or something to add, I study some more and there it is.

Other times I found that there were no examples for what the author was talking about and I was left in the dark. I keep trying, but I always end up with a headache trying to figure out what the author is talking about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"The tools were why I bought the book -- having access to Curves and Color Balance alone would have been worth it, but there are a lot more -- masking tools, color separations, -- I am just starting to appreciate how powerful these tools are -- for example, before buying this book I didn't even understand why you even wanted to separate color and luminosity, but now I use that tool on every single image I process.The book: the book is different from any other Photoshop book I've read. The most obvious difference is that it comes with neat Power Tools. A more subtle difference is that in addition to showing you how to manipulate images using Photoshop Elements (which most Photoshop books do, or should), it also aims to deepen your understanding of your images and controlling those images using manipulation-by-Elements. For example, he walks you through a somewhat complicated procedure of making masks to isolate mid-tone colors in your image-- there's a Power Tool to do it, but if you go through the entire procedure you will learn a lot more about how your image is put together. Not to mention that it was a revelation to me that you could have that much CONTROL!Because he aims to teach you about images and how to get the best image possible, as well as a good order in which to correct images, the book is sequential. Most Photoshop books I've seen can basically be read in any order, but this builds on things he's taught in previous chapters: for example, learning about tone in the earlier chapters is essential for understanding color manipulation in the later chapters. As part of this flow, there's information not only on digital manipulation but also on printing, which is an essential part of the process, which made me very happy. Just his (elementary?) explanation of the dpi/ppi/lpi needed for various outputs and how well you can print various pixel-size images has been really useful for me to have at my fingerprints, not even to mention the calibration tool noted by another review.On the negative side: as someone who predominately uses Elements for retouching digital photographs, I didn't find the sections on e.g. animation all that useful. I would have much preferred to see more about calculations, which I thought could definitely have been given more space, being such a complex subject. There are a fair number of typos, though it's usually pretty easy to figure out what the right thing ought to be, and I understand his website has errata. Minor issue: I had a hard time installing the tools, and had to go to the website delineated in the book to troubleshoot. (Turned out it was for some reason having a hard time with my external hard drive; once I unplugged it, it was fine.)I would strongly recommend NOT expecting this to be your only photoshop elements book (unless you are already an image manipulation guru, maybe). I personally have Photoshop Elements 2 for Dummies from a local book sale as well, and had read the whole thing and understood how everything worked in it before tackling this one-- I would've been lost if I'd tried to do it in the other order. I still refer to Dummies above this book when I want to know quickly how to do something simple or want to know what some random special effect does, neither of which are the purposes of this book.This book gives back to you what you put into it; the more you try to understand what is really going on, the more you will get out of it. To me, this is the hallmark of a great book; I've reread it twice already and am still learning more. To others, it may not be what you are looking for, particularly if you want quick recipes or quick fixes. If you've read my examples above and you're thinking, \\"Gosh, that sounds like it might be sort of dense... but worth it to really understand images and controlling images better,\\" this book may be perfect for you, as it was for me. If you're thinking, \\"Nuts, I just want a couple of auto-buttons to press to get cool effects or quickly fix everything,\\" this book is not for you.But if you have Elements 2 and are even THINKING of upgrading to full Photoshop (which I was), get this book first!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"To says that this book is well worth its price is an understatement.

But few of us can justify a purchase that great for a hobby. So \\"Photoshop Elements\\" looks tempting until you try it. Too many of the major tools of the full PS have been stripped out; you can't work with curves, make separations, look at individual color channels, etc., and that hurts.Well, it turns out you can do all that! Richard Lynch's outstanding \\"Hidden Power\\" provides a CD with plug-in tools for \\"Photoshop Elements\\" that virtually turns the simpler program into the full package -- at about a quarter of the price.If that were all Lynch's book did, I would give it 5 stars.

The fact is that \\"Hidden Power\\" is just about the best explanation of what those tools do, how color imaging works, and how to use powerful tools to good advantage that I've ever seen. And I've read a lot in 10+ years of manipulating digital images.Finally, \\"Hidden Power\\" includes the most useful tool I've owned for getting past the hardest part: making your printed output look right without spending hundreds of dollars on expensive 'profiling' gear and software. It's a simple file, with the colors recorded in CMYK format, and it's the perfect calibration tool. In one evening it solved completely the difficult problem of getting predictable, neutral-color black and white prints.Kudos to Lynch. If you go for Photoshop Elements, you have to have \\"Hidden Power\\" to go along with it. Accept no substitutes. Give the book a sixth star."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"This book is well worth the money for the &quot;Hidden Tools&quot; alone. I consider myself an intermediate user of Photoshop Elements. I have been tempted lately to buy the full-blown Photoshop to gain the additional capabilities. This book and CD gave me most of the additional tools that I thought I was missing.The book is not written for beginners. You should have a good understanding of how to use Photoshop Elements before diving into this book. Given the scope of this book, I found the first chapter to be a little too basic. I initially found parts of chapter 2 a little confusing. I never use gradient maps and found the explanation in the book to be somewhat confusing. I went back to my &quot;Photoshop for Dummies&quot; book and re-read the portion on gradient maps. This made the light go on for me on what the author was saying in Chapter 2. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 the most useful. These chapters dealt with the type of image clean-up I encounter most often. These chapters dealt with curves, which I knew was a feature I missed in Photoshop Elements. Chapter 5 showed some great uses of the History Brush, another missing tool from Photoshop Elements that you get on the CD in the Hidden Tools. The remainder of the book gave some good hints on how to improve your images as well.I read the whole book, but I am sure that not all was absorbed. I will keep this book close to my computer to use as a reference as I try to fix those difficult to correct images.The author of the book has made himself available to answer questions on several Photoshop Elements and retouching forums. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to go beyond the basics of what is available in Photoshop Elements."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"If you scan through the previous reviews, you will find that those folks who are familiar with the full version of Photoshop are raving about the tools provided and explained in this book. The beginning Photoshop Elements users are having a great deal of trouble. The reason: experienced users are not following along with the examples and the newbies are.Fact is, there are a large number of mistakes remaining in the book, even if you were able to find the errata on the author's book site. For example, the first big project leads you through creating color separations. There are two errors in the step-by-step instructions. One step for each is a +120 hue adjustment and the next should be -120 but the minus sign is missing. Users will find that they repeated the previous step and do not get the desired result. Additionally, the step changing one of the layer blend modes to 'screen' is omitted for each primary. The user will never get the greyscale result.There are numerous other editing problems as well. Stuff listed as appearing in the appendix is actually in the tools, and at least one of the practice files is named incorrectly. There are numerous small linguistic errors, such as using the word 'effect' when the word 'affect' is correct. Clearly this book was rushed into print before many aspects were finalized.That said, the tools are in fact very valuable, and the book goes well beyong simple follow-the-instructions explanation of Photoshop Elements. This sets this book apart from most others; you will know not only 'How' but 'Why'. I would recommend this as a second book to anyone who has some experience with Elements and can recognize why some of the practice instructions are not working correctly. They will also better appreciate the value of the tools.While this book has a special section for color plates that are important for following the instructions, my impression is that a number of publishers are producing comparable yet cheaper books using color throughout.For the first time Photoshop Elements user, I would heartily recommend Scott Kelby's book &quot;The Photoshop Elements Book for Digital Photographers&quot;. (New Riders) This book more than covers the basics of photo retouching and enhancement and is extremely fun to read. Every page is a full color page and it's $10 bucks cheaper. You will enjoy the book and will enjoy Elements even more.To Richard Lynch: Your work is a valuable contribution to the Photoshop community. Find a better publisher!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I am a rank beginner to Photoshop Elements and photo enhancement. When I first started reading it, I was nearly scared off, as I didn't know what he was talking about most of the time. However, as he kept saying he would explain this later, I trusted that he would and so far I haven't been disappointed. I am in the process of working my way through the book and am learning more than I could imagine. I sometimes have to go through a lesson a few times to get it, but eventually if I follow the instructions closely, I figure it out. If there is something I can't figure out, there is a website... where one can get more information and ask questions. I am fully satisfied that I've gotten my money's worth with this book and the accompanying CD and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I use Photoshop at work as a graphic artist and just can't afford to buy it for home. I've been an Elements user for a while because of that, and this book is a godsend. I can do all the things I do at work, and all it cost was the upgrade to this book! The 'tools' from the CD (they seem more like time-savers) add in curves, channels, and lots of other stuff that I use at work but couldn't in Elements, till now. They install easily and what I need works like a charm. I am very indebted to the author, who not only saved me time and money, but showed me some great technique that I now use in Photoshop!I'd encourage any home designer to consider this as an option: get Elements and this book instead of Photoshop for use at home. If there are tools Elements is missing now that I have the book, I don't know what they are.It is a ten (or eleven!) star value."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I have learned more from the first few pages of this book than in three years of playing with images in Photoshop and Elements and using my digital camera. I started using the tools immediately after installing them from the CD -- they work right in Elements! The author answered my question about the installation directly. The person in that other review who had difficulty should contact him via the book's website hiddenelements.com, or by email, which you can find on the book's web site.The book starts with a great demonstration of how color works by showing you how to make a color image from some images shot before there was color film! Then you move right along into understanding how to separate channels -- and why you want to. I found that chapter on the Sybex website -- you can read the whole thing right there. It is why I got the book, and then I found what the tools could do! They really make the program much more like Photoshop!The examples in the book really drive the points home. All the images from the examples are on the CD, and the step-by-steps are easy to follow. It has some advanced technique, but it really doesn't seem hard the way the author goes through it. The best is, I have tried th techniques on my images and see immedate improvement. I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I've been a user of Photoshop Elements (1.0) for about 6 months. In addition to providing 'hidden' tools within Elements (curves, channels, masks) this book provides good tips and suggestions for general digital photo editing and enhancements. The book is very detailed, but the accompanying cd provides examples from the book (to follow along) and also the hidden tools to update either Elements 1.0 or 2.0. The author is extremely knowledegable and he makes himself available for any questions/suggestions on his web site, and in various forums and discussion groups on the web. I highly recommend this book for Element users who want the power of full blown photoshop without the price."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"Although I haven't viewed all of the PE books, Hidden Power must rank with the best. I have to agree w/ the other reviewers that one must have a understanding of general photographic principles and digital photography. Coupled with the CD, you can treat this as a class or workshop. Each chapter deals with a technique or concept with exercises and examples, with step-by-step instructions. The first five chapters on gradients, histograms, curves and unSharp masks have some of the best explanations I've seen. And the CD alone with &quot;big&quot; Photoshop-like tools may be worth the price alone. If you need a text on PE for photographers, this is it. And if you're new to digital photography, buy a companion intro text recommended by other reviewers."},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I have to say I'm flabergasted over this book!!! Being a professional photographer and having used Photoshop for a long time, I doubted the usefullness of Elements when I bought it. As I worked with it, I found it to be a great &quot;backup&quot; program for me to Photoshop. Mainly because I could accomplish several of the same tasks that I did in Photoshop, only quicker and less labor-intensive.Then along came this book. I hesitated for a long time before buying it...my line of thinking being that I had all these tools in Photoshop and I knew how to use them, so why buy the book. I just decided what the hell, bought it, and couldn't believe it when I tried the tools. I can accomplish all the same things in Elements that I do in Photoshop ver batim. Now if only we could get a plug-in for the healing brush......hey Richard...are ya reading this for when PSE 3 comes out????I would like to address the Portland, Oregon reviewer's comments. If you're having that much trouble, I suggest you either learn how to operate your computer, learn how to use Elements and the plug-ins, or find something else to do. Richard Lynch did an excellent job of writing this book. There's strength in numbers, and all the reviews except for yours liked the book and the software that came with it and it doesn't appear that anybody else is having trouble running it.In short, Elements is a great program, Hidden Power is an excellent book that opens up the full creativity of Elements. I highly recommend both!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2","review":"I checked this book out of my library as I frequently use Photoshop 7 and Photoshop Elements 2. At first, I thought Elements is very inferior to Photoshop, but I have found ways to overcome its' limitations. That is the entire thrust of this book by Mr. Lynch. He provides detailed explanations and procedures for doing almost anything in Elements 2 you can do in Photoshop 7. Take time to read the book and work the problems chapter by chapter and you will learn a lot about Photoshop and Elements 2. I have six Photoshop Elements books by various authors on my shelf and this book is superior, absolutely the BEST! Along with the book you receive a CD containing Recipes for all the procedures presented in the book. Work through each chapter exercise to gain an understanding of what is being done. Then use the recipes to help you through each procedure next time you use it. Buy this book. You will learn at lot!"},{"Title":"The Sorcerer's Ship","review":"When a young American of the 1940s falls through a momentary crack between worlds while at sea, he finds himself a passenger on a strange ship in a world of sorcery & warring kingdoms. At first unsure of his situation, he soon sizes up the beautiful princess, the scheming minister, and the not-quite-human being who possesses unusual powers ...Here's one of the more obscure treasures reprinted in the classic Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series. While it's not a masterpiece of the genre, it has a certain sprightly energy & inventiveness, and deserves better than to be forgotten. There's a bright, almost breezy quality to the storytelling -- but the moments of unleashed magic have some real weight to them.Hannes Bok was primarily known as a science-fiction & fantasy artist. His brief forays into writing were inspired by the works of A. Merritt, who was his foremost literary idol. That inspiration is obvious in these pages ... but at the same time, he avoids the ornate (some would say purple) prose of Merritt, which nobody but Merritt could make work anyway, and achieves a simpler, more modest prose style. And it's a success.As always, series editor Lin Carter provides a short but informative introduction, one more personal than usual, as he knew & clearly loved Bok. The feeling of loss at his early death comes through in Carter's heartfelt remembrance. I'm not sure if this novel will ever see print again soon, so don't hesitate to pick up a used copy if you should stumble upon it. You may be pleasantly surprized!"},{"Title":"The Sorcerer's Ship","review":"I rather think that I would have liked Hannes Bok if I had known him. It is true that I am an astronomy man rather than an astrology buff. But it can be refreshing to listen to somebody who is passionate about certain things-- even if they aren't always what you are passionate about yourself. Bok also waxed enthusiastically about the art of Maxfield Parrish (under whom he had studied), the music of Max Steiner, and the fantasy writing of Abraham Merritt.After Merritt's death in 1943, Bok completed two of Merritt's unfinished stories, \\"The Fox Woman\\" and \\"The Black Wheel\\". And he wrote three solo novels in the vein of Merritt: _Starstone World_ (_Science Fiction Quarterly_, 1942), _The Sorcerer's Ship_ (_Unknown_, 1942), and _The Blue Flamingo_ (_Startling Stories_, 1948). The last two novels have been reprinted in book form, the third under the title of _Beyond the Golden Stair_ (1970). I have been unable to find evidence that Bok's first novel was ever a book reprint, but I would be delighted if some alert reader could provide contrary information.According to Lin Carter's introduction to _The Sorcerer's Ship_ (1969), Bok at one time copied Merritt's _The Ship of Ishtar_ (_Argosy_, 1924) in longhand. It surely does not require a great stretch of the imagination to see that _The Sorcerer's Ship_ was influenced by Merritt's novel. Both novels involve a hero who passes from our world to a parallel world and finds himself on a kind of magical ship fraught with dangers.Both novels also feature a heroine of high degree. But Bok's princess is not as strong as Merritt's warrior, and-- let us face it-- she is not the brightest wand in the magical carpetbag. She continually believes that the villain, whom an eight-year-old child could spot as a scoundrel at fifty paces, can do no wrong until it is too late to do any good. And she consistently reprimands her good counselor for his \\"improper behavior\\"-- again, until it is too late.But there are magicians and demigods in reserve... and a good thing, too. There follow a number of spectacular magical feats until one last bloody spectacle puts things back to a semblance of normality. There is a final touch found in many myths. The heroes who saved the day don't fit in their world any more. They are feared and shunned and misunderstood.Most of A. Merritt's novels were characterized by a kind of purple prose that many modern readers dislike.* Bok's later novel, _Beyond the Golden Stair_, had a similar (though not identical) prose style. But the style of _The Sorcerer's Ship_ is a bit more plain, straightforward, and action oriented.I do not mean to say that Bok stints in getting us to visualize a scene, from the crackle of dry seaweed beneath the hero's head (2), to the blue sky that \\"seemed to flicker here and there\\" against the quivering sun (3), to the lightning that was a \\"brilliant ball of fire\\" blossoming \\"like a moon\\" (69), to the fury of a storm at sea, to a brasslike city in the early morning sun. But _Ship_ is essentially an action story, a tale presented to us with quick cuts of the camera rather than with long, slow shots. Bok's style is just right for this novel.* I confess to a certain fondness for this style. It had its faults, but it was much superior to the style of most of the American scientific romancers in the early twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer's Ship","review":"Fantastic reading, I love this book. I had read it years ago and am so thrilled to read this classic book again."},{"Title":"Use Your Noodle!: A Nick Jr. Booktivity Pack","review":"My 3 year old enjoyed all of the activities, including the stamps and stickers and the cool crayon that holds 5 colors. The book is full of color with decent activities. I just wish there were more activities in the book; it's only 32 pages long."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"I recently bought this book, and while it does have some decent general information on drawing the female form (assuming you can draw all ready) I have to say it's pretty graphic, practically all the female models drawn are either topless or in some stage of undressing (with detail).There's even parts on how to draw adult sex scenes.(though no more detail than all ready stated...thank god)I definitely wasn't expecting that!It goes w/out saying it's definitely not something I would want to have out where anyone else can see it."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"Purchased this book because I've been impressed with others from the series, though the subject matter for most of the other titles I've purchased has been more of a kids style anime, like giant fighting robots and pet monster stuff. Figured I'd try and flesh out my collection, so I bought it, think it would be like some of the other series I've purchased and discuss the methods of how to draw the female form in an appealing way.But when the book arrived, I opened it up and found an basic discussion of how to draw sex and masturbation. None of the preview material I viewed on Amazon mentioned this part of the book. Found out afterwards I should have read the customer reviews. This book was disappointing, and I would not recommend if for anyone, and definitely not it's target audience of 13-18 year olds. Its just misleadingly designed, and should have been more appropriately marked."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"Well, I've reviewed this book since I got it recently, and I do have to criticize it a little. Overall, the layout of the book is decent, but it unfortunately assumes the the reader is already acquainted with art in general, and manga in specific. To be precise, the author starts out strong, but dumps the reader into the artwork with little to no explanation of the female body beyond some generalizations. He does cover structure of the female body, and the rear of the book covers guidelines as well.The artwork inside is above average, but looks hurried. In particular, some of the pieces of art look slightly out of proportion to the rest of the body. The author seems to take a point of view on drawing sexy gals from a sexual standpoint. People, this book is NOT for those under 13. And I'd have some trouble suggesting it to anyone not mature enought to realize this is an ART book, not a HOW TO DRAW SEX book.Otherwise, this is a laudable effort. It covers odd or hard to draw poses not ususally covered in other books, and it also has a section on drawing couples. Women are drawn in an unrealistic, but commonly drawn, style. A large number of more adult manga and anime are drawn using similar style, so this is a good introduction to the genre of Ecchi or Hentai artwork. It also has application in other genres as well, so don't take it as a cheaply made book about how to make forgettable storylines or how to draw over-developed scantily-clad women.Finally, a word of caution. As I mentioned before, this book deals with sex and sexual themes. Definitely not for minors. For anyone who is looking to expand their range of poses, brush up on new ways of drawing women (and some men), or even those simply hoping to broaden the range of their potential, this book will do nicely."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"Before I say anything, NOT FOR THE CHILDREN! This book will teach you a lot about the anatomy of seductive girls, I am a pretty experienced artist and normally I go for more modest approach, but this book was the perfect tutorial for me as far as this genre goes. Not a beginner book, but if you know your material and can produce good pieces then this book is for you. And there was this very good mini comic through out the book, Anyone who is mature in the \\"field\\" will enjoy the story the comic tells as well"},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"So based on the other negative reviews, I assumed that their primary objection was the lewd content: that there were sexually explicit poses and gratuitous depiction of female genitalia. And I was okay with that; I am a grownup adult person and I'm not going to be scandalized by cartoon sex happenings, I was interested in this book because I could stand to be better at drawing idealized pin-up ladies. And so I downloaded it to my iPad's Kindle app.Lesson learned? Preview everything on Kindle before I pay for it. This book is a crime.The artwork in this book is terrible. And I don't mean the content is terrible, I mean the technical execution of the drawings is just fundamentally flawed. You will learn nothing useful about how to draw women from this book. Legs are jointed oval shapes, breasts flat circles, the construction is slovenly, and none of the artwork in this book is informed in any meaningful way by actual human anatomy.Avoid Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals. It will damage your drawing ability."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"This book was really helpful, but this book is not for those how don't already know the basic skills and structure. This book shows a bit much mature content, so this book is recommended to those in the appropriate age group. Overall this book can help you draw all the basic components into drawing sexy women, if you didn't know how to do already, and other mature content. Again if you do not have the right skill and drawing structure needed, then this book is not for you but if you do then I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"This item is a good buy for drawing sexual and provacative anime and manga it is good for drawing echi manga."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"I recently ordered (and returned) this book. As the title and cover art would suggest, this is a Manga drawing book. However, when it arrived there may have been one or two pages of actual manga drawings. The rest were drawings of old classic cartoon style work to something you'd see in a Batman comic book. If you're looking for a book on improving your manga artwork, then I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"I have several different books of Manga drawing, some great and some not so great. I put this one near the upper third on that scale. Not much in the way of new techniques or insights, but solid stuff never the less. I would say if you can get this book for a good price (under $13 or so) it is worth the investment."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"While I did read this books previous reviews I still found myself quite surprised by it 's content; along side frequent nudity it contained groin shots, a chapter on drawing love scenes and even a short bonus manga about a couple having sex complete with mosaics. It's worst quality however is it's art which I would most certainly not consider to be above average but in fact amateurish at best the only time it really shined was in it's chapter on faces."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: Sexy Gals","review":"#1. THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!This book has very \\"desciptive\\" pictures. If you need examples of how to draw the female body, such as breasts,hips,thighs and bootys this book has plenty for you. There are many pages which shows pictures that could be considered PG-17. This book is good for examples of hair,eyes,lips,and the body. There isn't much \\"step-by-step\\" instructions but there are plenty of pictures which makes up for that. If you are looking for sexy outfits and sexy gals you won't find too many....

This edition has a complete Table of Contents which not only allows you to navigate to each individual play, but also to each act and then each individual scene.This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a KINDLE Shakespeare collection. Every other version I've tried has been a terrible waste of money and I wonder how long it's going to be before Amazon starts acting responsibly and deleting the worthless e-text versions of this and other collections or offering trial samples of every book listed so people will stop being ripped off.The only improvement I could see is for the table of contents and the individual listings to be justified on the right side of the screen next to the Kindle cursor, but the spacing is wide enough between lines that this is really just quibbling. I would like to see every Kindle book with this simple modification."},{"Title":"WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter of this e-book, and immediately noticed two things. First, it's not properly using the Kindle \\"table of contents\\" feature. While there is a page near the front of the book that says \\"Table of Contents\\" on top and has links to the contents of the book, if you load up the Kindle's \\"Go to...\\" feature the \\"table of contents\\" button is grayed out, so they must not have tagged their table of contents page correctly.Secondly, and much more importantly, there are no line breaks after the individual lines of dialogue in the play. Shakespeare's plays are mostly composed in iambic pentameter, and these iambic pentameter sections are almost always printed like poetry, with a line break after each \\"line\\" of five iambic feet, so that you can discern the meter more easily. In the sample chapter of this book, there are no such line breaks, and all the dialogue runs together into paragraphs. Having the line breaks in the right place is one of the baseline requirements for an edition of Shakespeare, so I give this one star.If the publisher revises the book to correct these two features, then it'll be worth taking a second look at this edition. Otherwise, avoid it."},{"Title":"WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE","review":"The book that I received was not the one that I ordered on Amazon.com.

This cookbook is an older publication but I wanted a copy because I live in a rural area and this cookbook is based on ingredients that are common everywhere. The recipes are regular down to earth cooking including many foods from the garden. Great recipes for anyone who cooks."},{"Title":"FARM JOURNAL'S COUNTRY COOKBOOK POPULAR EDITION","review":"I bought this cookbook with high school graduation money back in 1977 and it has remained my standby for comfort food ever since.I have collected hundreds of cookbooks, purged many because they are outdated but this one is one book that I will always keep. It's just good food - always flavorful, consistently good and well received by others. From the frozen french toast recipe to the vegetable soup - you will enjoy these recipes over and over again."},{"Title":"The Dive Sites of the Cayman Islands, Second Edition: Over 270 Top Dive and Snorkel Sites","review":"Lawson has continued with the attention to detail that he began in the 1st Edition with the best guide to dives sites for the Caymans.Very logical layout... format is easy to read and particularly interesting to follow...There are books that might do a good job of describing a particular site or two, but this book is the most comprehensive I've found."},{"Title":"The Dive Sites of the Cayman Islands, Second Edition: Over 270 Top Dive and Snorkel Sites","review":"Checking through my reviews, I see that I have previously commented on four books by Lawson Wood - with the last of these being reviewed in 2007. Now 3 more of his titles have crossed my desk in January 2013. As a mark of the high standards which this author sets for himself, I also note all seven books have achieved either a 4 or 5 Star rating. As a professional underwater photo-journalist & author myself and, therefore, an active globe-trotting diver, I have come to recognise how Lawson Wood produces information the diver can trust - and this work is no exception. I say this because I purchased the book in readiness for a trip to the Caymans and, although first published in 2001, the information I required is still valid today...This is another of those diving guides which I am able to recommend for three very good reasons. Firstly the information is all there, secondly it comes from Lawson Wood and thirdly, the book is well laid out - making it easy to follow and understand.Commencing with a very useful \\"How to use this book\\" which explains the various maps, legends and symbols used throughout, the work moves swiftly on to a potted history of the Cayman Islands followed by an equally important explanation of the country \`today.' Here we also find a page dedicated to the addresses and contact details for Tourism Offices and Tourist Booking Agencies throughout the world. The next section is particularly interesting and is headed \`Travelling to and in the Cayman Islands.' Here we find all the usual subjects of; accommodations, health, climate, money, customs & immigration, travel, getting there, getting around, cruise lines, shopping, sports and topside attractions. The final element of this introductory part of the book is a generalisation of the diving and snorkelling scene which provides all the details one would need to know including local rules, regulations, conditions and so forth.The remainder of the book is devoted to the dive sites of the three main islands in the order; Grand Cayman with 163 dive sites described, Cayman Brac (47 sites) and Little Cayman (56 sites). At the end of each of these sections are several pages of information specific to that particular island. To include my own minor (very minor!) criticism of the book at the relevant point in this review, I would have numbered the dive sites from No 1 right through to 266. Instead, they are numbered. Grand Cayman 1-163, Cayman Brac 1-47 and Little Cayman 1-56 which does cause a little (very little!) confusion when discussing different sites. Yes, I know very picky-picky but if that is my only criticism it really does say much for the book.Each dive site has a brief description and any number of the six different symbols which, when all is combined, provides the reader with depth, access, grade and so on.Finally, the book concludes with some fascinating information on; the marine environment - which includes details of the more popular underwater species, underwater photography & video and the ever-important Health & Safety.Well supported with first-rate photography and maps throughout, all things considered this is one of the better dive guides.NM"},{"Title":"The Dive Sites of the Cayman Islands, Second Edition: Over 270 Top Dive and Snorkel Sites","review":"This book is interesting, but you need to know that is was written before the last Hurricane and not all of the same spots are still there and information about the island has changed."},{"Title":"The Dive Sites of the Cayman Islands, Second Edition: Over 270 Top Dive and Snorkel Sites","review":"I bought this book with the hopes of learning about good snorkeling sites at Grand Cayman. I wanted information so that I could decide what places would be worth our time and would be okay to take our 9 year to (as well as a map of the location). I was quite disappointed. It describes numererous dive sites and gives a \\"star rating\\" for snorkeling of these sites. However, it does not really address snorkeling individually. There are several well known snorkel sites that are not even mentioned in this book. Thankfully, I learned about these sites over the internet so that we can enjoy them during our stay. This book did not help me prepare at all. I imagine it is good for those who dive though."},{"Title":"Hot Rod Road","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much for an older book. The book was listed as in good shape. It was in terrible shape. Binder coming off and pages falling out."},{"Title":"Jesus crucified again: This time in Ronald Reagan's America","review":"This book is a compliation of Bhagwan's talks, most right after his deportation to India, focusing on his problems he had here in the states. Whether or not it truly happened the way the book says or not doesnt matter. The fact is there was corrupt actions taken by our government and President at the time of the descruction of Rajneeshpuram and how the Christian nation rejoiced in this. These talks were given in Poona between 85 and 89. He died in 1990. The book itself it very controversial. Its not like Bhagwans other books. It was published by rebel house (oshos book press). This is a fascinating account and a very interesting and disturbing read. I highly recommend this one to anyone who likes Osho/ Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. I would tell all the bible-thumpers to stay away from this one though, it will only make you angrier."},{"Title":"Jesus crucified again: This time in Ronald Reagan's America","review":"I love all of Bagwhan's books, except for this one. It is my estimation that a majority of his books were written by some retired professor living in his commune, utilizing Osho's credibility and networking to produce literature. Osho, or his staff simply gives their editing approval. I don't mind this because I don't care who wrote it really, as long as it follows his thought patterns and opinions, I tend to appreciate this literature.This book is anexception, because it is strangely bitter, bitter, bitter and becomes purely propoganda. The fact is that unfortunatley Osho (aka Rashneesh) was addicted to Valum and laughing gas. He also probalby suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. This book of course does not mention this. It merely refers to him being poisoned. This book is a weirdly angy paranoid piece of propaganda attacking the Reagan administration. Whether he was poinsoned or not, the point is moot. It happened, and Osho is said to have come to terms with it. So I question why this was published in the first place. As with many of his books, its a clever title.I sincerly value every book published by Bhagwan (I may have as many as 40 or 50), but this is one book on my shelf that I honestly feel is taking up worthless space. I keep it because again I am a collector and I return to it to examine it's accusational tone for some kind of entertainment value."},{"Title":"The purrfect crime (A Golden look-look book)","review":"original batman the purrfect crime book from 1991 is the best batman children's book ever. it was the batman book i aways wanted when i was a kid. its base on batman year one but for all kids. i know any kid who loves batman and catwoman and pets would love this story.purrfect original art work. all i could say is i love it."},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"This is the best book of the trilogy (I bought the other books because of this one). This book summarizes the personal hell of one man, addicted and alone, unable not to bring death to those he loves. It is about conflict, guilt, isolation, alienation ...about heroism in its rawest, truest form.I first read this over five years ago, and it continues to fascinate me to this day. I don't care about the vampire monsters, per se, for to me they are only a necessary plot device. The same can be said for Selina's character. They only exist to further the true story, which is Batman's struggle with his own nature ...the horror of recognizing we receive pleasure from another's harm, the helplessness of an addiction to things we've not necessarily even experienced -- the overwhelming urge to satiate a thirst at the cost of our own soul. That is the heart and soul and core of this book for me.What would we do, given his power, his isolation, and his horrible thirst? At one point he narrates this for us:\\"Thirst haunts me,Life tempts me,Death mocks me.Together, the three, they curse me.\\"That moment for me, sitting in that bookstore, galvanized an experience I had never been able to put words to ...his isolation, his thirst, his utter loneliness and despondency -- they were so real! Deep calls out to deep, as I've read elsewhere, and in spite of this book's gore and melodrama, that moment called out to me and still does to this day. I felt connected to his guilt, his shame, to his sinful pleasure and self-disgust in a way that no media ever has before or since. Selina's character, the strength and nobility she provides, and the heartbreak of her loss, bring the entire story to an unstoppable head between the maniacal Joker and a Batman now drenched in the blood of his lover.The authors deserve top credit for making a Batman that is, ironically, more human as an undead vampire than he ever was in life. May he rest in peace...Get this if such things interest you."},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"In a pitch meeting, this might sound like one of the dumbest ideas ever: What if Batman turned into a vampire? [A vampire *bat*, get it?!] But writer Doug Moench actually manages to create a powerful and affecting tale from this premise - one whose Edgar Allan Poe-like meditation on guilt and monstrousness ends up rivalling \\"Arkham Asylum\\" and \\"The Killing Joke\\" as one of the most penetrating psychological studies ever drawn of the Dark Knight. And if there has ever been more dynamic and expressive pencilling in a Batman story than Kelley Jones's outstanding work here, I haven't seen it."},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"As a follow-up to the awesome Red Rain, Bloodstorm succeeds. It is set prior to the time when, in modern continuity, Batman discovered Dick Grayson. Incidentally, there is no Robin, and it's a good thing, as Batman must struggle with his lust for blood, hating what he has become, but not wanting to leave Gotham unprotected. The iussue is: By sticking around in his present state, is Batman actually damning Gotham rather than saving it? Batman has to put that question on the backburner,however, when the Joker takes over the remnants of Dracula's undead legion. It's an awesome battle, believe me, and Catwoman is even along for the ride! Bloodstorm also succeeds quite nicely in creating a parallel universe; this story seems like it could be another storyline in a monthly comic. Of course, we know this isn't so because our Batman isn't a vampire, but it still has that feel to it. Finally, with the team of Doug Moench, Kelley Jones, and John Beatty, how can you lose?"},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"In many ways, Bloodstorm is superior to the book that is continues, Red Rain. Whereas Red Rain was bogged down by the need to introduce the concepts of vampire lore, character reaction and setup, and other formalities, this book can leap right into things and get to the important business of telling the story.In this Elseworld's tale, Batman is now a vampire. In many ways it is a vindication of his self image as a creature of the night apart from normal humans. At the same time, Batman is built on the one thing that separates him from the monsters he fights- he will not kill. As the vampiric urge to kill grows, however, he must go to extraordinary measures to fight it or lose all that he is.Great storytelling with an ending that even shocked the hell out of me. If you liked Red Rain, you'll love Bloodstorm."},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"4.5 Stars because I thought the Joker really made this story a little to silly/lame compared to Red Rain. That being said, this book is amazing!The first half is really silly and focuses more on the Joker then I'd like, half way through Selina enters the story and things get great. The ending is amazing and the whole second half of the book is one incredibly action packed and emotionally driven book. I do wish that the ink was by the same artist who did Red Rain because this doesn't have that really deep and depressing look like the first book did. This is a must buy/read for ANY batman fan!"},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"Batman Bloodstorm is well written and well plotted, Kelley Jones's art is fitting for the story lots of angular and grotesque pictures with more than enough teeth to make what it's supposed to be a vampire story worthy. Elseworlds stories take DC's characters out of their usual settings and put them in stories that take place outside of the continuity of their regular titles. Heroes put into strange times and places some that have existed or might have existed others that can't or couldn't or even shouldn't exist. Bloodstorm is a follow up from Red Rain where the Prince of Darkness comes to Gotham city and starts to raise an army of undead followers. Batman is the only one who can stop them, with the help of Tanya, who was Dracula's child she turned away from evil and developed a human blood substitute. Tanya gives Batman her blood, giving him vampiric powers without having died . In the climatic battle, Batman kills Dracula, but not before the Count puts the bite on Batman, transforming him into a full vampire, with bloodlust. Bloodstorm begins with the vampiric Batman hunting the few vampires he missed in Red Rain. By this stage the Joker has become the leader of these remaining vampires, he leads them on a rein of terror. As the story progresses the blood substitute Batman has been taking grows less and less useful Batman is now fighting a losing struggle against his rising bloodlust. He joins with Selina Kyle who was bitten by the Jokers lieutenant, this bite turns her into a cat being. She first attacks Batman thinking it was he who caused this he convinces her otherwise they join forces to defeat Gothams vampires and the Joker. This story is in many ways a vindication of his self image as a creature of the night. He also believes and is built on one thing that seperates him from the monsters he fights he will not kill. As the vampiric urge to kill grows, he goes to extraordinary measures to fight it or lose all that he is. Batman Bloodstorm is written by Doug Moench fantastic work fantastic writing he also co wrote Batman & Dracula Red Rain, Kelley Jones the artist has a unique style suited to horror. This was a great book a must read especially if you've read Red Rain Bloodstorm is an absolute essential."},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"\\"Batman: Bloodstorm\\" is so satisfying as a sequel it makes \\"Red Rain\\" a much more satisfying read. One review really hits the nail on the head when asserting that the vampire plot and characters such as Catwoman and the Joker are really device to explore Batman's struggle with his fallen condition. He is more powerful physically, but the inner struggle of his nature is a fight between the will and the \\"condition\\" of who he now is. The line of demarcation is the drinking of blood - it calls, but he wills against it for it is wrong.The dialogue is much cleverer in this book as well and helps the reader ask his or her own questions: \\"Are we looking for hope or answers?\\" Probably like Batman, we are looking for \\"both.\\""},{"Title":"Batman: Bloodstorm","review":"This book explores all the dark side of batman.

A simple house and a bunch of exercises on teapots, spheres and other built-in 3ds max objects. While I understand that the aim of these simple exercises is to showcase 3ds max features, he should have at least provided more challenging exercises (geared towards the architectural visualization industry) either at the end of each chapter or at the appendix section of the book. There were no tutorials on how to render an building structure using night-time settings, interior structure using both daytime and night-time settings, somehow the reader would have to figure-out the settings for himself/herself. There were no guidelines on a lot of topics that would be very helpful for people working in the architecture industry for instance there were no examples on how to superimpose a 3ds max building into a photograph (an important feature to showcase the proportion of a proposed building to adjacent existing structures) no examples on how to create lights using manufaturer's specs. and no examples on how to use third party plug-ins such as RPC from archvision to provide vegetation, trees, people, cars in your 3d building model. -Again these topics, you have to learn it on your own. The author has also a habit of applauding a particular 3ds max feature in architectural visualization but fails to provide exercises/tutorials on the other hand (eg. panorama exporter, hair & fur effect for 3d grass). If your local bookstore carries this product, find time browsing it before buying this book. Bottomline, this book is not a good reference for the architectural visualization industry and for people planning to study 3ds max 8."},{"Title":"Foundation 3ds Max 8 Architectural Visualization","review":"For people venturing into architectural visualization, this book is not for you. Not enough content for 3d modelling(building) and other architecture related stuff. I quite agree with the other guy that the title should be changed to 'Basic 3ds Max'. However, even this title is not appropriate since the author had not covered many important features of 3ds max. The exercises are so simple and won't help you very much in building up your confidence on 3ds max even after you finished reading this book. The book is expensive and lacks quality. I won't buy a book from 'friends of ed' publications anymore."},{"Title":"Foundation 3ds Max 8 Architectural Visualization","review":"To my knowledge, this is the first text written specifically for architectural visualization using 3D studio max.

The only complaint I have is that the book is black and white and sometimes difficult to see what he is referring to in the a few of the images. Although conceptually his explanations make up for this deficiency. Overall, this book is heads and shoulders above all over books on 3dmax if you're specifically looking for Architectural visualization."},{"Title":"Foundation 3ds Max 8 Architectural Visualization","review":"It is a good reference book for beginner.

While I used this book as part of a course, I do think that anyone really interested could at least teach themselves many of the basics of 3ds max with just the book alone.

One of the book's dissabpointments is that it doesn't have many examples of how to model or map buildings. It talks about lighting, basic modeling, and cameras but leaves a lot to be desired by a more experienced user.
