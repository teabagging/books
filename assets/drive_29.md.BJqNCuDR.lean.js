Skeptics may not like his obviously critical approach towards much of the scholarship that he presents; however, this is without a doubt the most conservative-friendly introduction there is out there. The greatest strength about Witherington's book is that it can appeal to conservative Christians and open many up to critical scholarship--I've seen this happen ot many friends to whom I've loaned the book. Thus, it is a great door through which to walk into the larger world of NT biblical criticism, which I believe has a great deal of potential in tempering some of the extreme, ridiculous tendencies present in conservative Christianity."},{"Title":"A Warm Moist Salty God: Women Journeying Towards Wisdom","review":"Ms Gateley seeks to redress the imbalance in our traditional Catholic / Christian view as God. The Judge, the stern Father, the remote.She shows God's &quot;warm, moist, salty&quot; side, Her feminine side. (Doesn't the title evoke incredible memories of freshly baked bread being taken from the oven, its fragrance and tastes lingering in memory for years!)The book is short and segmented. It can be taken in small easily digestable bites, or raced through with glee and delight.If you want a different view, a different approach to God, if you wonder why God seems so far off and unattuned to your wavelength, give this book a chance. It's on my gift list."},{"Title":"A Warm Moist Salty God: Women Journeying Towards Wisdom","review":"I enjoy Edwina Gateley's poetry and have many of her books.

In some ways, the ideas are sadly dated: His personal debate over what to do when a young tough flicked a cigarette onto his overcoat -- what is the proper non-violent response? -- may seem antique in the days of Dirty Harry but is a window on our lost ability to reason ethically.

Just as I was starting to think, hmmm, yeah, this could be a true story, BAM - somewhere around page 132 - Mercy, the prizefighter (LOL), drug toter becomes a scriptwriter!

After witnessing her father's corpse being desecrated at the funeral, Mercy's life starts on a roller-coaster ride from which she reaches the highest highs and lowest lows all while running drugs up and down Interstate 95. Turner's character names had me rolling (Cook'emup, Cleezy) and I had two endings in mind, one of which was right. I thought Cleezy was gonna turn out to be Mercy's brother! How did Cleezy manage to kill Paula in broad daylight and there be no witnesses?

A Hustler's Wife was her best work. The book began with the potential for greatness and ending leaving you feeling as is something was missing like 4 or 5 more chapters. Other parts of the story are left unanswered. She could have blended a hell of a story if she would have taken a little more time with this one. Oh well, Nikki has to come harder or she will lose me as a reader. She has the talent it just was not all there in this book. Don't believe the hype about this one being the best.

Turner put her foot into Riding Dirty on I-95. Mercy's life was a nightmare. The scene of Mercy's father's funeral was dreadful. My god, the poor man was already deceased. That scene was made for Hollywood. This is to John Singleton, The Hughes Brothers or Hype Williams ... get at my girl, Nikki. LOLMercy went from group homes to the red carpet. I was thankful that she finally found success as a writer/filmmaker and true love with Cleezy whom she was able to tame. He certainly needed it because he was a reckless fool.There were some characters in this book: Mercy's trifling mother, Cleezy's thieving mother, Jus the snitch, Raheem the playa playa (had to write it twice) and that punk Taymar.The way this book was written and ended, there's bound to be another installment.

The story was all over the place, and it just seemed like some of the changes with the characters didn't seem believable. I mean C-Note was portrayed as so cold blooded yet he was portrayed as so sweet and loving towards Mercy. It just seemed like he fell out of character. Some of the stuff with the Feds didn't make sense. They were a big deal at one point in the book and then it was like the characters just forgot about them and they no longer had an impact. At times it seemed like some of the twists in the book were thrown (ie, feds involvement, certain murders, etc) in just to add more drama, and I don't believe they were neccesary.Even though the plot didn't flow very well the book was still off the chain. It was a page turner that had plenty of twists. Nikki Turner is the best, she can describe the grind and the hustle like no other. Her words are like poetry and her style is off the chain."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"The book was awesome. It was real and it wasn't too fictitious.

She has really grown in my opinion as a writer from her first book. Riding Dirty was a bit slow. I don't need a whole lot of action, but when you are skipping pages to see what is going to happen next, then yhea, you may need a tad bit more action to get you through the book. The story line was unique, and it was very well established, but it was too long for no reason and it really did not get to the point quick enough. A plus in this book, 1. not too much violence and the characters were believable and 2. was the fact that the grammar/spelling was on point. I would recommend this book, it just did not do it for me."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"Riding Dirty on I-95 is a good book. For those who said and or think that this book is part two of 'The Glamorous Life' need to think and again and get their facts straight... its not even close to being part two of TGL. In this book they only mention Lynx because he's Cleeze\\"s older brother and never once have they said anything about Bambi. They do mention them both in 'Forever A Hustler's Wife' but not much.I read a few reviews before I got this book and one of them said she didnt like the book all because there was no riding dirty on I-95. I'm not sure of what book she read but Mercy did more on I-95 than Cleeze so she need to go a re-read this book.Another reviewer said that this was part two of 'The Glamorous Life' which was the main reason I bought the book in the first place.

Mercy pulled herself together and did what she had to do to take care of herself. I love how Mercy got movies out there even though there are some money hungry people out there that think they can step on your toes she still kept on moving ahead. Cleezy was the one I think needed a big change and after him and Paula got together I thought that was going to happen but, that didn't happened like I thought. I kind of figure that Cleezy dad and Mercy dad knew each other from way back but, never thought it was like that. C-Note became Cleezy he became a bullet no one couldn't stop after so many times he got stepped on I guess he needed to prove himself to the thug world that he can't be stepped on anymore. Jus' was a low downer mainly a big snitch I see what Cook'em-up put Jus's balls in his month. Tallya deserved what she got she needed that for real. Being money hungry don't get you know where.Mercy did her thang and showed off her stuff on the red carpet. Showed that she can make it even from life or death.Liked the book was hoping to see more to Cleezy and Mercy relationship as it grows after the baby.

Which kind of surprised me because I loved her other novels. Riding Dirty almost felt like she had a deadline to meet and rushed it. The things that Mercy did really didn't coincide with the character that Nikki had built her up to be. As a street smart hood saavy chick Mercy(in my opinion) wouldn't have done alot of things she did even if it was for love. I never skip pages in her books but found myself skipping ahead trying to get back to the interesting parts. The reason I bought the book was based off of Nikki's name alone. The beginning started off pretty good with the drama of her losing her dad on her birthday but towards the middle it tapered off and never picked back up.

Mercy was one bad sistah. And C-Note/Cleazy was a beast. I have to admit that I almost got emotional at the very end.

The combination of these two give it a bit more spice and flavor!My personal opinion is that this is her very best piece of work!

It was a nice effort but i just didn't do it for me, i found myself struggling to keep reading it. But to give my honest opinion this is a book you just have to read to determind how you feel about it. If you look at the reviews other then mine either people feel like it didn't capture them or they thought it was great. So i suggest borrow it before you buy it. To complete my review im going to give riding dirty on i-95 3 stars for effort."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"I HAVE READ MOST OF NIKKI TURNER'S BOOKS AND THIS WAS THE WORST.

I thought this book was very enjoyable, it kept me turning the page. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that some of the course of events were just not realistic to me. But, we are reading FICTION. The point that I took away from the book was that the main character just wanted to be loved and accepted for who she was. She was doing so much for others trying to get that acceptance, she learned that she wasn't honoring herself in the process. She learned that she had to look out for herself, and not rely on other people. This was a good read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"From the days of \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" to \\"A Project Chick\\" to \\"The Glamorous Life,\\" and now \\"Riding Dirty on I-95,\\" Nikki Turner has grown from princess to queen of hip-hop fiction. Her stories are fresh and innovative, keeping the reader wanting more.The main character of this book, Mercy, faces many challenges and struggles that add to the complexity of her character. Born to a street hustler with issues of abandonment, acceptance, and grief--to name a few--she is ever evolving making the reader root for her, and sometimes against her.I hope that this spin-off from \\"The Glamorous Life\\" is only the second part of a trilogy. A few secrets were revealed in the ending that left the door wide open for another intriguing storyline.I wish Nikki Turner continued success as she lives her dream. Keep turning out that wonderful urban hip-hop fiction that has become your trademark. All hail the Queen!"},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"On the lowdown, this book was real to me. Know what I'm saying! Ayight! I felt Nikki, you know.

Out!"},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"Nikki just keeps getting better and better. I was really feeling how she brought in character's from her other books. We get to see what Cook Em' Up is doing now and Lynx and his baby brother C-Note. Also when Nikki brings back Tressa and her twins for a cameo appearance my jaw just dropped to the floor. I grew to love and enjoy reading about Ms.Mercy Jiles and her family. I hope the author is going to come back with a sequel cause I sure would like to know the outcome of this story. Truly this is Ms.Turner's best work although to this writer none of her work has disappointed. Everytime I hear the song Riding Dirty On I 95 I think of this novel that had me entranced for four hours."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"The book grabbed me from the beginning because of the tragedy Mercy suffered when she lost her father on her 7th birthday. I really enjoyed how she hustled and constantly tried to make a better life for herself after bouncing from foster home to foster home. I was amazed at how she kept her composure and street smarts when she was transporting the drugs. I admired most of all how she raised her niece when her sister practically abandoned her. I just did not like how the story jumped around and how characters and subplots were introduced and never revisited. For instance the character \\"Herb\\" who turned out to be an FBI Agent and Raheem. In my opinion these were pivitol to the plot and FBI and police investigations just don't disappear.The whole fairy tale situation with Mercy's script writing was a complete joke to me. If she was so street saavy how in the world did she keep falling for the okey doke, be it her sister Tallya or getting played by a few others in the book. At some point you are supposed to learn from your mistakes. And Cleezy what a nut job! How are you going to change your name from C-Note to Cleezy and no one questions it. I get why he wanted to change his name but don't some street names have some type of significance. We learned early on why he was called C-Note so why not tell us what Cleezy meant. His name should have been Crazy instead. I have enjoyed all of Nikki Turner's books but she needed to come more correct then this! This read like a rough draft from a high school student, drama mixed with fairy tale. I could really slap Mercy and the rest of the characters in this book. I hope if there is a sequel there will be more attention paid to character development and making the plot flow from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"There has to be a sequel! The ending left me hanging. I definitely want to know what will happen...there are sooo many loose ends that Nikki will have to tie up. Although there was not a lot of drama or suspense in this book~it's not Nikki's best. It was a smooth read but it was not as intense and dramatic as i thought it would be and as many of her other stories have been.

Nikki Turner doesn't disappoint with this twister. Nikki Turner fans will see cameos from characters in other books \\"The Glamorous Life\\" and \\"A Project Chick\\". Cleezy aka C-Note is the brother of the notorious Lynx, Bambi's soul mate (The Glamorous Life). We also see Lolly again Cleezy and Lynx's scandelous mother who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Even if it means hurting her own sons. I like the way Ms. Turner puts a character in as a cameo in one book and then gives them their own storyline in another. I'm assuming there will be a possible storyline in the future for Tressa's twin boys (A Project Chick)because their gangsta style cameo in this book was a tease. This book was very interesting to read and it keeps you in suspense of what's to come next."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"I can't wait for the sequel this book!

All the characters seem real. Nikki Turner truly did her thang again."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"Because this book was too whack. There was no plot at all only a bunch of stupid incredible scenarios that made no sense. What hood girl like mErcy who supposedly had all these street smarts would go and do all these stupid things? Fall in love with a boxer after one phone call, never seen him. Had all these sisters and brothers she was raised to be close to and then we only find out two girls name and one boy, and they just pop in out the blue after never even hearing their names before. What nigga changes his clothes in front of his boys at his car after getting knocked out and becomes and instant killer with a new name? What brother you know can shoot his woman dead and nobody suspect him. Suddenly he just happens to go to his moms spot and happens to see her bank account with all his money in it? What sheisty mama in the hood puts her stolen money in the damn bank? Then out of nowhere Mercy is some big screen writer who sells movies and still lives in the projects in an apartment RIGHT NEXT DOOR to Miss Pat. Do you know how long and hard it is to get an apartment in the damn projects? And Miss Pat just happens to hook her up with one right next door? People you need to stop lying to these authors and telling them their books are so great when they don't even take the time to sit down and think of a plot that is worth your money. This is a story full of incredible crap that could not have happened and situations conveniently pulled out the air with no skill in building a story. Don't sell yourself so short by thinking this is a good book because it is amateur work. The only good twist was at the end when they learned who their fathers were. Cleazy, C-Note, that was the stupidest transformation of all. And where was all the riding dirty on I-95? She forgot all about that part which was supposed to be what the story was about. It ended up sounding like the author's well-known misadventure with Triple Crooks (Bermuda Triangle) Publications. I liked that there were very little mistakes in spelling and grammer in the book but that can be accomplished by having a good editor. The story itself was weak and whack and just plain old not creative and more like a fairy tale you tell a 13 year old to keep her in line. It is nothing she should try to sell to grown people who read more than 2 books a year so stop lying to this author and pretending this book is good. I am going to buy her next one but I want to see some real progress in her stories."},{"Title":"Riding Dirty on I-95: A Novel (Nikki Turner Original)","review":"Nikki My Girl!!!To me this one seem to be slow and to long time to get to the point I found my self skipping pages to get the action.

Turner created a wonderfully urban tale that pulls your heartstrings. What I really liked about this novel was the main character Mercy. I liked the fact that Mercy was always trying to build a better life for herself. I also liked how this author incorporated the issue of weight and self-image in this story which added to the realness of this novel. Readers will not be able to put this book down. There are some heart stopping moments in this book that will keep you glued to the pages. By the end of the book, you will wonder if there is room for a sequel.

I very rarely post reviews on novels I have read. However, this novel has moved me to write. This book effortlessly flows from one characters plight to the next character without making the transition seem choppy or unrealistic. It gives an in-depth view into the mind of the characthers and allows the reader to judge for him/herself the actions of the characthers. When I finished the novel I felt as though I had lived the life of Mercy and left wondering what would become of her and C-Note (Cleezy) when it was all said and done."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"I am well acquainted with the videos and DVD's of Bryan Kest and he is one of my favorite yoga teachers. His style is very warm and relaxing, not uptight. He concentrates in this CD on the breathing first and foremost, then the poses, stressing that you should follow what your own body needs and can do. That said, this is a really good, intense workout that makes muscles sore that you didn't even know that you had. I am not usually one to do ninety minutes of working out on a regular basis, but the time goes fast in this workout. None of the poses are especially difficult to do, although there are a few that I did in the modified format. Advanced power yoga refers, as Bryan says, to your body awareness. I am aware of mine - it is still sore! (but in a good way!) The workout leaves you relaxed yet invigorated and I feel that I can concentrate easier on the poses in this audio only format where I am not distracted with someone else's form. Another interesting aside is that this CD recording is of an actual class - you can hear Bryan interacting with the students, helping with poses, you can even hear the bus go by outside once or twice! It feels as if you are there ---and I find that his narrative is comforting, but also humorous sometimes and helps break up any tension you might be feeling going into the pose. A welcome Workout to anyone's collection.Namaste."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"Yes, new places are cooking! I thought I was in good shape until I tried this one! I never did so many chaturangas in one class! Yes, my muscles are sore also!The fact that there is no music on this CD did throw me at first, but I got used to it. Also, Brian's voice is not as soothing and melodious as Shiva Rea's or Rodney Yee's but he is quite entertaining! I also like the fact that he brings the true practice of Yoga to us in a down to earth way.In short, I loved every minute of it!"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"This a a great CD and booklet to have in your collection if you are an intermediate to advanced student. I really like to use it together with my practice at the studio. I quite like Bryan Kest's style of teaching because he is honest about what you have to do to achieve the routine. He's very motivating for me, despite what others have said in their reviews. I wish he'd come out with more of these sets, and I'd probably buy them all if they were at this advanced level. Bryan Kest does not have a typically soothing, meditative voice, yet he brings home the meaning behind the asana: keep the focus on your breath, even during the tough poses.My only complaint is that the CD abruptly ends, and yet there is only 15 minutes on the second CD. There is plenty of room for a nice meditation/relaxation sequence at the end of this, and I feel that its something that really SHOULD be done after investing 90 minutes in this routine. One can do it on their own, but why not have him fully complete the practice?"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"I am a stay at home mom that does not always have the time to make it to my yoga class.

This CD and booklet are very helpful, but sometimes I just don't have 90 minutes for yoga. I watch the shorter DVD practices more. However, after I'm done with this advanced yoga I feel completely at peace. It's intense and wonderful!"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"Coming out of cumulative injuries of over 30 years of running and cycling, I have developed my Yoga practice over the last 6 years, while utilizing several instructor-guided programs. During this time, I have used 4 of Bryan Kest's programs, starting with his 3-part Power Yoga video. His audio programs are my favorite (recorded during actual classes), since experience eventually makes photos/video unnecessary; his descriptions of asanas throughout each program/class are excellent reminders of the poses. If I may add, Bryan's voice is quite relaxing throughout most of each presentation.Yes, Mr. Kest has his \\"own way\\" of presenting his instructions, however I am easily able to get past these moments, for they do provide one with further insights into the human element of a Yoga practice. Bryan emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper breathing, while holding a smile on one's face. He and his manner tend to \\"grow\\" on one after a while.Thank you, Bryan Kest, for your years of dedication to Yoga practice and to promoting the healing principles of the Life process.Peace."},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet)","review":"As far as home yoga workouts go, this is a great one. It is a great workout, but keeps with the spirit of yoga. I am a Bryan Kest fan - so this was another addition of his to my collection.

I have also shared Freddie's story with the high schoolers as well. It was great to see their faces of curiosity and fun as the story unfolded. Some of the high schoolers commented that they might have learned the notes if they would have started with Freddie.

He is a brave little frog who learns to face up to his fears and wins a new friend in the bargain. Along the way readers are exposed to a clever variation on the note names of the music staff (treble clef). Freddie's home, Eli's vacation home, azaleas and Crocodile River are a few of the mnemonic devices employed to capture the reader's attention and make the line and space note names of the treble clef stick in the reader's mind.The authors use humor and melodrama to draw children into the story. The accompanying CD has catchy, enthusiastic music that the students really enjoy listening to (especially Freddie's singing voice!).This book is an excellent alternative to teaching the line and space notes of the treble clef (never has \\"Every Good Boy Does Fine\\" seemed so dull!).I use the flashcards and puppet along with the book and CD and my students (ages 8-9 years) beg to hear from Freddie."},{"Title":"Freddie the Frog and the Thump in the Night: 1st Adventure--Treble Clef Island (Freddie the Frog Books)","review":"Freddy the Frog is an awesome way to teach the Treble Clef.

I also thought that Heyer had stuffed too much 19th century slang into the dialogue - so much so that it made it hard to understand at times. Usually when she uses slang phrase its within a certain context or conversation that makes it obvious what is being said/talked about/ecc. But in this book I often felt like these phrases or words were piled on top of each other so that I had a hard time following the meaning. I think I'm generally pretty good at understanding the language from this period since I read so much based in the period, but I had hard make of it at times.Lastly, I wished the book didn't end so aprubtly after the misunderstading was cleared up. This seems to always be how Heyer ends her books, and while she remains one of my favorite authors, I always find myself wishing for a more developed ending.Other than that, the characters were typical Heyer - fun and fully developed. The two leads had that dry, satirical humor that Heyer does so well and the supporting characters were equally interesting and added to the action.All in all, it was an enjoyable read, but not one I will be keeping on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The Nonesuch has always been one of my favorite Heyer books, because Waldo is such a NICE man! (My absolute favorite Heyer book is Faro's Daughter, or maybe Devil's Cub or Venetia.) But, the audio version of The Nonesuch is really well done and makes the book even more enjoyable. Eve Matheson does a spectacular job of bringing each character to life, and making each character sound clearly different. Her characterization of Tiffany is much, much better than reading it and trying to hear her in one's mind. And Tiffany's Aunt has a great accent! I honestly appreciated the book more after listening to the tapes.I would recommend that anyone who likes the book, try to buy or borrow the audio version and listen to it on a road trip or two or three. My only complaint--and I could say the same thing about one of the paperback releases--is that the art work on this and other Heyer audio tapes is simply awful. Don't look at that picture, and instead visualize Pierce Brosnan or some other masculine prize!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Sir Waldo (the Nonesuch, for his sporting successes) is not one of Heyer's typical aloof male love objects; he's kind, charitable to a fault, and devoted to Ancillaalmost from their first meeting. Ancilla is also attracted to him, but convinced because she's a governess that he can't be seriously interested in her. The action, and humor, in the book comes from Ancilla's charge, Tiffany, an incorrigibly willful teenaged heiress who is beautiful, manipulative, and throws tantrums if she doesn't get her own way in all things. Other people don't really exist for her except as objects for her own pleasure -- she has no heart and no understanding at all of how her actions affect others or why other people might eventually reject her because of her horrible behavior, despite her wealth and beauty.I liked the very different hero a lot, and Ancilla is a wonderfully capable woman, able to deal with Tiffany pretty handily most of the time.While this book isn't my favorite Heyer (The Grand Sophy is one of my all-time favorite books -- it'sjust so funny!) it's an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"STORY BRIEF:Nonesuch is defined as a model of excellence or perfection. Sir Waldo is called the Nonesuch because of his sporting accomplishments and skill with horses. He is wealthy. He establishes and supports orphanages that care for, educate, and provide children with skills. He recently inherited Broom Hall, a rundown estate near the town of Oversett. Waldo stays there to oversee repairs and improvements. He plans to turn it into an orphanage. His cousin Julian accompanies him. While there, Waldo and Julian meet and interact with a number of people who live in Oversett.Ancilla had a season but didn't fall in love. Her family is low on money so she gets a job as a teacher in a girls' school. Tiffany attended this school and was so bad she got kicked out. Tiffany was sent to live with her aunt Mrs. Underhill in Oversett. Since Ancilla was the only person Tiffany would listen to, Mrs. Underhill hires Ancilla to be Tiffany's governess/companion. Tiffany's parents died leaving her wealthy. She is vain, selfish, narcissistic, irritating, obnoxious, spoiled, and extremely beautiful. She throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way. She expects all men to fall in love with her.REVIEWER'S OPINION:Like other Heyer books I love the various personalities, their interactions, and their conversations. I enjoyed watching Ancilla influence Tiffany. For example, Tiffany was upset that she wasn't invited to someone's party. Ancilla told her that the party would be held in a green room that would clash with Tiffany's blue dress and why it would be better to ... Tiffany accepted this. Tiffany's behavior throughout the book was bad which was fun reading.Julian is blinded by Tiffany's beauty. Waldo sees through Tiffany immediately. Tiffany is confused by Waldo's hot vs. cold treatment of her.Waldo falls in love with Ancilla, but she won't have him. The author used my pet peeve of a \\"big misunderstanding based on miscommunication.\\" When Waldo asked her what was wrong. I was angry that she would not tell him. This continued for much too long. For this reason I gave it 2 stars. If you don't mind the big misunderstanding and her refusal to answer questions, but you're a Heyer fan, then you should like it.As far as romance goes, this is typical Heyer with a friendship developing through the book, and a declaration of love at the very last moment. I would have liked more story between the couple after they declared their feelings. I also wanted to know what Waldo was going to do for Laurence at the end. Laurence wanted to borrow money for a business.The book description is somewhat misleading. It mentions \\"An impetuous flight\\" and \\"A Gallant rescue.\\" This happens at the very end of the book. Most of the story is about other things happening before that.I love the narrator Eve Matheson. I'd almost recommend this just to spend time with her. She has a lovely British accent and does all the voices well.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 10 hours 49 minutes. Narrator: Eve Matheson. Swearing language: mild. Sexual content: none. Setting: 1816-1817 England. Book Published: 1962. Genre: regency romance."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I adore Heyer - she is unbeatable when it comes to sharp, dry and witty dialogue so amusing it should be illegal. In Nonesuch, she delivers - I LOVED the hero and heroine, the dialogue was wonderful as always and surprisingly, I did not even tire of Ancilla's spoiled rotten ward.That said, Nonesuch is not one of my favorite Heyers because much of the plot in this book is supported by the malicious gossiping of the ruling dames of the small country parish (Oversett) in which the majority of this story takes place. Unfortunately, all of this gossiping is needed to support the much dreaded \\"misunderstanding\\" plot Heyer also implements towards the end of this book. To be fair, the \\"misunderstanding\\" plot line in general, is one I detest more than any other as it is all together too often and poorly used.Despite this criticism, even a disappointing Heyer (yes, there are maybe one or two others in addition to this one) deserves no poorer a rating than four stars, for a dull gem in her collection becomes a shiny diamond amongst drab pebbles when compared to the whole of the genre. My favorite Heyer? These Old Shades. :) If you've never read her, and love dry and witty dialogue as much as I do, I recommend starting there!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I just finished reading The Nonesuch and have enjoyed in immensely. Sir Waldo Hawkridge is the notorious \\"Nonesuch\\", handsome, wealthy, a noted Corinthian, admired by his skill as a whip and known to be quite eccentric due to his 'wasting' his wealth of creating homes for orphans. It is with this plan in mind that Sir Waldo travels to Broom Hall which was recently left to him to find it in a shocking state of disrepair. He decides that he will fix it before turning it into an orphanage.While there he is the talk of the town and invited to many dinners and balls. Lord Lindeth, his cousin, is also an eligible bachelor so all the girls in town are disappointed when he sets his sights on Tiffany Wield, a rare beauty, who is staying with her relatives, the Underhill's, and with her governess/companion, Ancilla Trent. The whole town has a lot of respect for Miss Trent because she comes from a respectable family and is familiar with London ways so they turn to her when Sir Waldo appears. What follows is a fun story of misunderstandings, love, and family!However, if I would nitpick I don't believe that the description of the book does it justice. There is no running away to London (only the attempt of it) perhaps in the last 50 pages of the book or so. I would certainly recommend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I enjoyed this one, though not a favorite. One thing detracted from my enjoyement- the Book Review is focused on the flight of Tiffany. That event does not occur until the last 45 pages of the book. Because of the way the Book Review was written, every time Tiffany acted up (which was often), I expected \\"the flight\\" to take place."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I'm a relatively new GH fan. In fact, I only discovered her this past summer. OMG - talk about addiction -- I'm so far gone that I might never get back. Nonesuch was so good that I almost went blind trying to finish it in one weekend. I try to take breaks with contemporary lit in between her books - but its just not the same. Anyway, I challenge anyone to fine a better author dedicated to this time period. And, if you do, please let us all know about it. I grabbed up most of her books last year when they were on sale for her birthday. Thank goodness I have a cache.Hooked in Charlotte Hall,Hardt2"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The \\"Nonesuch\\" is Sir Waldo Hawkridge, a leader of the athletic and sporting set of not-quite-dandies known during the English Regency as \\"Corinthians,\\" and no one can touch him when it comes to boxing or racing a curricle or riding in the hunt. He's also very wealthy and all his relatives are surprised when their tight-fisted Cousin Joseph Calver leaves Waldo his entire estate. (Largely because he was the only one of the family not to annoy the old man with all the reasons why he ought to be the heir.) Now Waldo is journeying up to Yorkshire to look the property over and see how much rehabilitation might be required (he might just add it to his string of homes for urban orphans, and his much younger favorite cousin, Lord Julian Lindeth, goes along for the ride. At the other end of the road is a community of country folk of the sort Heyer likes to stir together, just to see what pops up. Most notable among them is the job-droppingly beautiful, seventeen-year-old Tiffany Wield, a spoiled, headstrong, selfish, self-centered heiress who is convinced that (and behaves as if) the world revolves around her. Lindeth, of course, becomes her latest conquest, and Sir Waldo undertakes to keep him out of trouble, even though my lord is not a minor. Tiffany's governess-companion, Miss Ancilla Trent, is much more gently born than her position would indicate, as well as intelligent and straightforward, and Waldo himself is soon smitten. The narrative proceeds as you might expect -- there are no great surprises -- but the journey to the story's resolution is thoroughly entertaining. The characters, as almost always in Heyer's historical romances, are nicely developed and fully realized -- if only she would cut back a little on the period slang and cant. Or else include a glossary, because even with my background in history, there are words and phrases I don't know. Still, this one is at the upper end of the Heyer spectrum."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I began reading Georgette Heyer when I was about 15. My mother had them all by the time I was in Jr. High. One rainy day I had nothing else to do (In the early 70s, one found oneself in that situation more often than in these times of cable TV and the internet.), and I picked up my mom's copy of this book.Needless to say, I read it in a day, and by the end of the 3 day weekend I had devoured 3 more Heyer novels.This is less lighthearted than many of her books, but one of my favorites, for sure. I love that Heyer wrote about flawed people in extraordianry situations. Perhaps it makes me feel better about my own flaws, but I think it makes the characters more real, more believable.I was learning French at the time I first read \\"These Old Shades\\", and that added to my enjoyment, too.Heyer researched this historical era thoroughly. I've seen sketches she drew of the clothing, and many pages of facts about the time period. Her own life wasn't as lovely as the lives she gives her heroines...at least, they had problems, too, but all got happy endings. I'm not certain she ever got that.Years later I was in the library looking for a book to read while caring for my first newborn, and stumbled across a writer by the name of Jane Austen. I had no idea who she was, and found \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as enjoyable as a Heyer novel, to my utter surprise. These two ladies, above all, have written romances I can stand reading. No sexual situations, very little profanity (and none of it gratuitous, IMO), and sparkling, witty dialogue that's at times so droll!I can't recommend an author more. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The book was in excellent condition and arrived in good time. Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Moving out of her usual London Ton settings, Georgette Heyer takes us to the Country, and the social setting is that of the upper middle classes.This books moves quite well, and the characters are rather unique amongst the denizens of Heyer's books.You will enjoy your sojourn with the inhabitants of the town, and this book will rapidly become a favorite."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I've read her books before and have enjoyed them, but this one just wasn't as good. The verbage was too stilted. Some of the dialogue was funny but for the most part I got a headache from reading it and couldn't wait to finish the book."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I'd read several of Georgette Heyer's books before this one. While I loved the witty dialogue, the rich language, the attention to period detail, and the characterization, there was always something that kept those books at the 4-star level for me. An enjoyable light read, yes, but not a beloved must-have book. This was the first of her books to earn the 5-star rating from me.I think it's mainly because I like both of her main characters exceedingly well. Sir Waldo Hawkridge is known as The Nonesuch, a man without equal, one of the Corinthian set. But, he is exceedingly down-to-earth, a charitable man who doesn't think more highly of himself than he ought, and with a wonderful sense of humor to boot. Miss Ancilla Trent is a lady born, but when her family fell on difficult times, she became a teacher in a girls' school and is not ashamed of it, but has accepted her new place in society. Sir Waldo finds her as the companion to a spoiled rich girl used to turning everyone's head. But, it is Miss Trent who eventually turns his head. Both characters were very likeable, and well-developed, and it was a pleasure to see them end up together, with some obstacles along the way.As with Heyer's other books, this has the wit and dialogue and great characterization (including some minor characters). It also is \\"clean.\\" Her characters share no more than one or two kisses/embraces (even that not described that much), usually when they have come to be engaged, but the romance is still believable. And, in my book, it's much more pleasurable to read. There is a scattering of mild profanities and a very small number of casual uses of the Lord's name in exclamations, but not so much that I have a problem with just skipping over them.Overall, I would recommend this book as one of Georgette Heyer's best, and an excellent starting point for someone interested in trying her books."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"When you read a Georgette Heyer novel, you can be sure that you will enjoy a finely written book with nothing offensive in it, something that cannot be said of most romantic fiction of our day. Yet, her books are witty, fun, well plotted, full of atmosphere, and filled with a variety of terrific characters. The Nonesuch is no exception.The Nonesuch is one of my favorite Heyer books because of its characters. The Nonesuch, unsurpassed as a sportsman, thus the nickname, is really quite a nice fellow who is polite and caring of those around him. After coming across too many heroes who are haughty, rude, and just plain jerks, this is something I look for in a book. If I don't like the hero, why read bother reading it?So, we have a wonderful hero, and an equally lovely heroine. Ancilla, born to a respectable family, chooses to support herself rather than be dependent upon relatives. She is kind, confident, and clever along with a dash of wittiness. She stays calm when others about her are in a tizzy, but is not a dried up prude we cannot like or identify with.In addition, there are various young people that are very well written, particularly the spoiled young woman Ancilla is companion to. I find it refreshing to read stories where the young men are respectful and treat women politely.So, if you are in the mood for an old-fashioned style romance, The Nonesuch will do very nicely."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The Nonesuch is one of my all time favorite books. It is Georgette Heyer at her best. With a heroine that you can sympathize with and admire and a hero that you can fall in love with, it is a safe bet that this book will provide any reader with a very good experience. I have loved Georgette Heyer since I was a teenager and I greatly enjoyed introducing her to my daughters. All three of them are putting together their own collections of Georgette Heyer's books. We have many lively discussions over which of her books is our favorite. The Nonesuch is one of my favorites. My only problem is that I can't decide on 1 favorite. I have many. I highly recommend this book to people who love regency romance. If you have never read Georgette Heyer, then you have never really had a true regency romance experience. No one creates characters and portrays the regency world quite like Georgette Heyer."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I just finished reading this again.

You get a period romance a cut and a half above the rest in quality, way more fun and interesting, without losing any of the entertainment value or the quaintness of the historical setting. Great writing, great fun!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Instead of her more usual London or Bath settings, in this delightful novel - which is a comedy of manners every bit as much as a romance - Heyer takes her characters to the village of Oversett, in Yorkshire, close to Harrogate and Leeds. Sir Waldo Hawkridge has just inherited the run-down and ramshackle estate of Joseph Calver, purely on the basis that Sir Waldo was the only relative 'who paid as little notice of me as I did of him'. Naturally, there are relatives who are unhappy about this bequest, and these add a further element of humour to the tale, especially when one - Laurence Calver - follows Waldo to Oversett.Society in Oversett may not be what Sir Waldo is accustomed to, but the local residents are very quick to include him in their activities: balls, routs, simple country dinners, the ridotto that no-one came to, and quiet evening entertainments. It helps that Sir Waldo is known in London circles as 'The Nonesuch', a great Corinthian admired by many. And his nephew, Lord Lindeth, a charming and handsome young man, is of course the delight of the young unmarried girls.However, Sir Waldo appears to be most intrigued by Ancilla Trent, who is, she informs him, a most superior governess/companion. Her charge is the Beautiful Miss Tiffany Wield, quite the most lovely girl Sir Waldo has ever seen... but whose personality by no means matches her looks.This is where Heyer's talent for humour comes to the fore. Tiffany is an incredibly selfish and self-centred young woman, and Waldo and Ancilla frequently join forces in a hilarious manner in order to make her see the error of her ways - not to criticise her, for she would refuse to listen, but to persuade her that such behaviour would cause her to lose her looks, or to make the mythical Marquis she wishes to marry to have a disgust of her.Ancilla certainly finds Waldo's company congenial - and more than that, he makes her laugh. But it never occurs to her that his interest in her is any greater than the fact that she is intelligent and can actually make conversation - after all, one of these days he will return to London and forget all about the governess he knew briefly. However, she doesn't know Waldo...This is a lovely, entertaining read, full of deliciously entertaining character studies (Tiffany, Mrs Underhill, the Squire, Mrs Chartley, Laurie Calver and many more), witty dialogue, a gentle secondary romance and, of course, the main love story, between Ancilla and Waldo. This is another of Heyer's 'older heroine' novels, subtle, romantic and very enjoyable. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"What follows is not a review - just a few thoughts about The Nonesuch. I would think anyone looking at the reviews here probably knows the plot anyway!I really think that the whole of my adult reading life has been spent looking for something to fill in the gap left on Georgette Heyer's death. I first read Austen in high school and discovered Heyer in my freshman year at university when someone suggested to me that she was &quot;the next best thing to Austen&quot;. I guess that was a truth self-evident.I've read thousands of romances, sandwiched in between the serious history and biography I adore, on buses, trains, in the car, in waiting rooms, during hurried lunch hours and in bed at night to relax after another stressful, hectic day. But, really, if I am honest with myself, there are just a very, very few authors that are on my keeper shelf. Hundreds of authors have come and gone for me. Some I have dismissed after reading a chapter as too puerile, too facetious, too ill-researched, too derelict in the simple use of the English language.Heyer, however, rarely disappointed. I adore her later books, filled with characters of great wit, insight, morality and self-knowledge who mature and come together through real life experiences - all conveyed in prose of the very highest standard. I guess that's it - Heyer's exquisitely wrought prose telling stories of genuine human emotional experience, all carefully and perfectly set in the Regency world - immaculately researched and painted for the eager reader.The Nonesuch is, of course, one of my favourites - and I expect I would say that about most of her works. But Sir Waldo and Ancilla so perfectly epitomise adult love, good works and social constraints and decent moral standards that you have to love them. Village life is portrayed beautifully - so much remains the same!Rant, rant, rant. Every time I go back to Heyer, I am demoralised when I pick up a modern &quot;wanna be&quot;. What to do about that?"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"From memory The Nonesuch was one of the first Regency romances that I read, I was very impressed, certainly enough to find moreThe book is placed for the most part in Yorkshire, which at this point in time started to see the appearance of the Neuveau Riche, who had made their money from the wool or other trades that were happening in the area. As always Georette Heyer is accurate historically, I like the difference between what is acceptable at a private dance and a public dance for example. The language used is correct, the minor characters are interesting in themselves. Laurence Calver for example definitely has my sympathy.From the dust cover of the Heinemann edition....Old Joseph Calver's will is a surprise to all his relations and a disappointment to most of them. Its consequences also cause a great stir in the parish of Oversett in the West Riding when the news arrives that Sir Waldo Hawkridge is coming north to inspect his inheritance, the late Mr Calver's decaying residence, Broom Hill. For Sir Waldo is the most discussed man in London Society, wealthy, handsome, still a bachelor, the acknowledged leader of the Corinthian set, and known as the Nonesuch for his athletic prowess.At the Manor and the Rectory, and particularly at Staples, the home of Mrs Underhill, where her tempestuous, beautiful niece, Tiffany Wield, and her governess-companion, Miss Ancilla Trent, are also living, there is excited anticipation of the increase in social activity which the presence of the Nonesuch will bring. The young men of the neighbourhood look forward to learning from him all the latest refinements of dress and the most daring new tricks to be performed with well-bred horses, while their elders express their doubts about the expensive habits in which they expect the None-such to encourage their wives and children. Both excitement and doubts increase when it is heard that Sir Waldo is accompanied by his young cousin, Lord Lindeth.Miss Heyer writes with her usual wit and grace of the commotion which the arrival of the two fashionable strangers inspires, of Sir Waldo's real intentions and of the unexpected train of events to which they lead. The Nonesuch ranks amongst the most entertaining and accomplished of her Regency romances."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Even if you can't abide romances, read The Nonesuch anyway! I have only recently discovered the Heyer novels, and The Nonesuch is definitely my favorite. Ms. Heyer has created a memorable cast of characters with depths of personality not always seen in lighter romance novels. Tiffany Wield is one of the funniest and most realistic brats I've ever read about. It's worth reading just to laugh (or cry) at her. Though heaven help anyone who would tell her so, Tiffany isn't the heroine of this story. That honor belongs to Miss Ancilla Trent, practical, &quot;old-cattish&quot; (as she describes herself), and not in any way a victim of circumstance. But Miss Trent's self-designation as an old maid does not fool anyone, least of all the Nonesuch himself, Sir Waldo Hawkridge. As I said before, this isn't just a romance. In fact, as in most of Ms. Heyer's novels, the plot itself and the interactions among characters are the attractions of the book. The middle-aged Mrs. Underhill is just as entertaining as the handsome Sir Waldo or Lord Lindeth. I pick up the Nonesuch whenever I'm bored. It never becomes boring. Step into this magical summer of balls and parties in this quaint English village, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I love this book! This is my favorite Heyer novel by far. The dialogue is very funny and witty and the hero and heroine are both &quot;good&quot; people. (No rakes or schemers here). The dialogue between the hero and heroine reminds me a little of Darcy and Elizabeth in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The heroine, Ancilla, is a very intelligent, competent, nice woman- one you really can root for. Her counterpart Waldo is everything you would want him to be. I once read that Georgette Heyer actually didn't like this book. I'm not sure if that is true, but if it is I can't understand why. Perhaps some people prefer a more stormy heroine like Sophy in Heyer's &quot;The Grand Sophy&quot;, but that kind of obnoxiously outgoing character gets old. And the scene where Sophy is nursing her young relative in the presence of the hero and it dawns on him that he is in love with her is so cheesy. The Nonesuch has no chessy, contrived scenes because the attraction is totally natural and believable.By the way, this is a great book for younger readers as well. It isn't very heavy and totally clean. Perfect for a mother-daughter read!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This novel is different from Georgette Heyer's other work in two ways. First it is set in a small country town instead of London or Bath. Second, the hero and heroine are both ordinary people and not Lord or Duke. The hero (Sir Waldo Hawkridge) is uncomparable to any other man and hence, Nonesuch, and the heroine, Ancilla Trent is not just a governess but a 'most superior' governess.The dialogues are witty and funny, let it be between Sir Waldo and his cousin Laurence Calver, or between the hero and the heroine or ladies gossip and advices.The good thing about the whole book is that nowhere you feel that the hero/heroine dominate. There are many interesting characters like the beautiful Tiffany Wield (Ancilla's spoilt ward), Lord Lindeth (Sir Waldo's unofficial ward??), Laurence Calver and the ladies and young girls of the town, and every character has its own fair share of the book.Interesting parts of the stories are when Mr. Calver 'tries' to gain pity of his cousin, first by words and later by 'deeds', or Tiffany's rants and how Ancilla and Nonesuch join hands to deal with her and so on.This simply written book makes a delightful reading."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"A writing instructor suggested I read Heyer because I like mysteries and good characters. I picked up The Nonesuch and I must say that it is hard to find more immediately engaging characters that Heyer's. I don't want to give the story away at all -- but if you like good characters, so romance, and mystery - -this book wraps them all together neatly."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This is one of my favourite Georgette Heyer novels. I read it first as a teenager and it went completely over my head-the people involved seemed too old and too careful. but as I grew up I appreciated the subtle nature of the attraction between the dashing but cynical Sir Waldo and the ever so proper Miss Trent. Maybe it helps to remember the English obsession with class and position (much discussed by Jane Austen) to understand the difficult position our heroine is put in and how the story is resolved. It's not your standard regency romance but I've always preferred Heyer's later more intriguing novels (Venetia, A Civil Contract, an Infamous Army) I love Tiffany's shallowness and Miss Trent's way of managing her, I love the dialogue and I just love this book!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I'm currently going through a phase of reading Georgette Heyer novels (great fun) and of the fifteen or so that I've read to date, this is definitely my favourite.Once again, Heyer provides a quiet heroine who wins the hero through her intelligence and manner, rather than astonishing beauty. In this book, the Astonishing Beauty gets her come-uppance.Waldo Hawkridge is perhaps rather less flawed than most human beings, but the gentle romance between him and Ancilla Trent is lovely to read.The usual cast of amusing characters, great language and amusing escapades makes this book well worth reading. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The Nonesuch is a pleasant tale about a country neighborhood enlivened by the visit of a celebrity. This is much the same territory that Jane Austen covers, only with a more modern sense of comedy. Our heroine is well-bred, sensible and clever; our hero is affable and wealthy. The supporting characters in general are well drawn, but the standout is Tiffany Wield, the headstrong and completely spoiled heiress whose conniving ploys for attention and adulation frequently drive the plot. She's not in the least likeable, but oh boy, is she memorable. I would have enjoyed this more if the obstacle to romantic bliss for our Hero and Heroine was less contrived. Still, it's a pleasant visit with country society."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This is such a good story. The plot is thick, the characters well described.

While I'm a huge Austen fan, I've shied away from most other romances due to a low tolerance for melodrama, and I was presently surprised by how well the Nonesuch fit my personal criteria for beloved romance. (My preferences are idiosyncratic, so no offense to high drama lovers. :)) The other reviewers have done a wonderful job with the plot summaries, so I'm just going to list what I liked best about it. If you share my tastes, you'll like it too.1. Both the hero and heroine are totally lovable people. They are smart, sensible, funny, and kind individuals whom you like right away, and go on becoming fonder of them for the rest of the book. You can root for them without any reservations.2. The characters actually get to know one another before falling in love. Most of the book is dedicated to showing the hero and heroine talking, interacting, making each other laugh, and getting to know one another long before either one declares it a grand passion. By the time the characters realize they are in love, the reader has seen that their personalities and senses of humor complement each other perfectly.3. The tension, plot, and romantic resolution in no way depend on the hero or heroine acting stupid. The biggest hurdle for the romance is the legitimate problem of Ancilla's station. When she refuses to let herself believe that his emotions are serious, regardless of how earnest he seems, until he actually makes an official proposal, she's actually making a sensible decision considering the improbability of a man of Sir Waldo's position marrying a governess, even if he does like or even love her. It also makes sense that, having made this decision, she is unable to avoid him to prevent herself falling deeply in love: It's her job to chaperon Tiffany when she goes out with Sir Waldo's younger cousin, and she can't very well prevent her hero from coming along too. There is one Absurd Misunderstanding in their way, but it occurs at the end of the book and is cleared up in a chapter or two.4. The minor characters are interesting and endearing. We love the earnest Lord Lindeth, the vulgar but affectionate Mrs. Underhill, the entire sweet Rectory family, and most of the other people in the book. Tiffany and Laurie, if not lovable, are amusing and endlessly fun to watch.5. It's funny. The hero and heroine are genuinely witty and you find yourself laughing along as they joke around. Tiffany, the foolish and selfish beauty, is hilarious to watch and nasty enough that you never feel the least bit guilty for laughing at her humiliation. The scenes from the final portion in which she tries to escape to London are delightfully absurd, and have the effect of making our other spoiled and ridiculous character, Laurie, look sympathetic in comparison.This book reminded me of a lighter Jane Austen: none of her scything social and political satire, but brilliant style, lots of heart, and great good humor. I would recommend this to all her fans."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Well, no--but it is surely among the best! I suspect that the VERY best Heyer is the one you read first--in my case, Venetia. The Nonesuch has a fascinating cast of characters, from the \\"elderly\\" hero and heroine, to the vulgar but kindly Mrs. Underhill, the genial Rector and his family, the spoiled beauty and her counterpart the spoiled young man. As usual, Heyer's style matches the period of which she writes (no \\"scenarios\\" or modern slang here). The plot moves smoothly (again, as usual): the story unfolds as the natural result of the characters and their interactions (and sometimes the weather). Finally, The Nonesuch is humorous as well as witty.BUT. Don't buy the current Harlequin edition! There must be editions out there which have been better proofread. The first of several typos which I noticed was \\"hunger\\"--I finally decided that the intended word must have been \\"hunter,\\" which is a horse bred for hunting foxes (not pulling curricles or merely \\"hacking\\" about). Having enjoyed the introduction, there I was, savoring the well-loved story (for probably the third time), when these typos tripped me up. Of course, if this doesn't bother you--well, go ahead and buy this mass market edition. My own copy (from 1973 or so) may be physically bedraggled, but I'm not letting it go!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"In Regency England, a Nonesuch is the title given to a gentleman who excels in all of the manly sports such as riding, driving, boxing and fishing and the hero of this story, Sir Waldo Hawkridge, is just such a man. When he was bequeathed a huge, rundown house by a relative, he decided to rebuild it to house and educate orphans, a scheme which he had already executed in other parts of the country. Several of his relatives are not in favour of vast sums of money being spent on \\"dirty, scruffy brats\\" as they put it but as Waldo is already the possessor of an immense fortune, he does not hesitate to proceed with his plan. His young cousin Lord Lindeth who is bored with the repetition of town life, elects to accompany him to the West Riding to inspect the property and is noted by the unmarried young ladies of the district as a possible matrimonial catch, especially the superbly beautiful, very rich but thoroughly spoiled Tiffany Wield who is staying with her aunt until she officially comes out in the Spring. She is nominally under the control of her well born but penniless governess, Ancilla Trent who struggles daily to make the heiress conform to the rules of polite society, to little avail. This is a charming, pleasant and easy book to read with no filthy language, murders, blood letting or rough sex and is a delightful change of pace for this reader. When I feel that I need a mind wash, I always retreat to Georgette Heyer to feel clean again."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I discovered Georgette Heyer in Junior High (that should date me) and have been a huge fan of hers ever since. This is one of her more delightful romps, combining her humorous comedy of manners with a mystery. A rollicking good read!!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"An interesting twist on the \\"older heroine\\" story, The Nonesuch is a novel about Ancilla Trent, who is serving as a governess in the household of the Wield's and has taken on the enormous task of trying to tame the neighborhood beauty Tiffany Wield, mainly though a calming presence and quick thinking, not to mention running circles around her intellectually. Tiffany is stubborn, hot headed, spoiled and completely self absorbed and she is not helped in this by her doting family or legions of admirers. She is a beautiful girl, with nothing in her head but concerns about herself and has a fiery temper when provoked that results in huge temper tantrums and generally shocking behavior. This last fault ultimately lands her and her governess in a potentially devastating scandal.The Nonesuch, Sir Waldo Hawkridge (and who would have thought the hero of a romance novel could be named Waldo?), has inherited property in the neighborhood and has moved in to inspect an estate that has clearly fallen into shambles and isn't truly fit to be lived in by anyone. The neighborhood assumes he's moving in for good and, as they say, a man in possession of a fortune must be in want of a wife, or so the neighborhood thinks. If you think this story mildly resembles Pride and Prejudice, no surprise, it does.I liked the unique take on a Pride and Prejudice type of story and wasn't at all bored by some of the revisited themes since the story was told in a such a different way with very different characters. Also the wit and sparkle of Ancilla was often put to great use both in verbal sparring with Sir Waldo and with keeping Tiffany in line.Speaking of Tiffany, I have to say she turned out to be one of those characters you love to hate. Miss Wield is truly wild and her naivety, stupidity, purposeful ignorance and complete self absorption were major turn offs. Her complete beauty and dazzling presence were her main reason for her many beaus, but her temper sometimes gets the best of her and the fallout risks landing her and her governess in a socially devastating scandal.The reason this novel lost a star was because such a pairing between a member of the gentry and the working class would have excited much scandal. The novel The Nonesuch ended up being so wrapped up in Tiffany's scandal though there wasn't much time to worry about anything else."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The Nonesuch, one of the many Regency novels written by the master of that genre, Georgette Heyer, is as dull and uninspired as its title. The story centers on Sir Waldo Hawkridge (yes, she really did name her hero Waldo!!!!) who is so unparalleled in looks, fortune and conduct that he is known far and wide by his nickname of \\"Nonesuch.\\" The other main character is his love interest, Miss Ancilla Trent, a genteel-but-impoverished governess/companion who is herself as much a paragon of perfection as Sir Waldo.What makes the story so dull is that nothing much happens. It is comprised mostly of dialogue (so heavily dosed with Regency cant as to be almost indecipherable at times) and is simply the long and drawn-out story of Sir Waldo and Ancilla meeting, falling in love and finally becoming engaged. Their attraction begins early in the book, from the first moment they meet, and their union is a foregone conclusion since there are never any threats or even serious challenges to their relationship. Yes, Ancilla does suffer doubts, but they are not very strong and it is obvious to the reader that she is under a simple misunderstanding which will be nicely cleared up before the end of the book. 330 pages of a steady but uneventful attraction makes for slow and dull reading.What makes the book even more dull is that it is totally lacking in interesting characters. Both Waldo and Ancilla are perfect paragons from the first and remain so all throughout the book. Everyone else is dull and perfect, also. Except Tiffany, of course, who though bratty and insufferable at least is a bit interesting and unpredictable, which is more than can be said for anyone else. Heyer usually inserts one or two quirky, over-the-top characters (often a parent of one of the main characters) to lend a humorous element to her story, but no such character existed in The Nonesuch. There was humor and sarcasm here, but it was very subtle, very understated, very dull.This book reminds me of Jane Austen's novels, and fans of her works will probably enjoy this one. But I find Austen's works too boring for my taste, and so too is The Nonesuch. I'm giving it three stars only because Heyer's technical skill is so strong that I have to concede it is a well-written book even if it is a yawner."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This was not one of my favourites of Heyer's. I really disliked the leading character and found it hard at times to read on given that she was like nails down the blackboard for me. Also, I found there was quite the abrupt ending. I feel as though pages were missing? Maybe the Kindle version is a bit messed up?"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was ok but not one of her better stories."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Georgette Heyer is outstanding in The Nonesuch. She never fails to amuse and entertain. This book compares well to The Grand Sophy and Frederica which are favorites of mine. No one appears to have the grasp of Regency manners like Heyer."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"Well I must say that this was enjoyable. Predictable but likable. The characters are a treat though one could use a spanking. Just the ending was too abrupt for me. I wanted the announcement and wedding and descriptive dresses. Flipped the last page and went... no dont tell me thats it. Mark of a good book."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This is by far one of my favorite Heyer novels! There is no ridiculously dramatic plot, but two well-matched people falling in love amidst a host of ridiculously characters in a small country town. Makes me chuckle every time I read it!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I loved this novel. As I do most Heyer's works. Very witty dialog and the level of sarcasm by way of things thought but not necessarily said is just great. I loved how so many things were over the head of Tiffany our wayward, self-serving, thoughtless main character. Miss Trent is a gem. She has such an unusual first name and she is so patient and good natured tho' dealing with Tiffany. Miss Trent doesn't feel that Sir Waldo could have a legitimate interest in her after all he's flirting with Tiffany as well and is known as a man about town. So does he or doesn't he? Just who are Waldo's brats? He seems to have at least 50 of them. A surprise for many in the neighborhood. There are alot of characters in this novel. Neighbors, nosy old ladies, the rector and his family, Waldo's cousins, their parents, lots of young women & young men so be prepared."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"\\"The Nonesuc\\"h is a historical romance set in regency-era England. While the story was very funny, it was based on an excellent portrayal of human nature instead of outrageous but charming behavior by the heroine. The characters were engaging (except the spoiled heiress, and she wasn't supposed to be), and they acted realistically. I always understood why the characters acted like they did, and I enjoyed the romances.The story didn't have much suspense since there didn't seem to be much danger of anyone truly not ending up with the right person. The spoiled girl made for a bit of excitement near the end with her escapade, and I was always wondering what she would do next and how Waldo and Ancilla would cleverly handle it. Personally, I loved every minute of the story and didn't find any of it slow-paced. The historical details about their everyday lives were vivid and flowed naturally as a part of the story.There was a misunderstanding at the end that wouldn't have lasted long if they'd just discussed it (and it didn't last long in any case), but I had to laugh when it happened. The source of it had been worked into the story from the start, and the reasons why it didn't immediately get cleared up (including it being something that a woman with good manners wouldn't talk about) were convincing.There was some explicit bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I loved this novel and would highly recommend it to those who like slower, gently unfolding romances."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"The eponymous hero is in the countryside to fix up a tottering inherited mansion for his pet charity, housing orphans. The heroine is a woman of good birth who has fallen upon hard times and is employed in trying to rein in the excesses of a young, spoiled beauty. There is not much spark between them, but this is a charming book with a host of secondary characters, from a young cousin who is bedazzled by the gorgeous Tiffany, to another cousin who wants to wheedle a stake in a horse-selling business from the great Sir Waldo, to all the younger people in the neighborhood and their seniors. There isn't a complicated plot and the humor is gentle rather than uproarious. This is a low-key, enjoyable book, well-suited for lazy summertime reading."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"This is one the most light hearted of Georgette Heyer's Regency novels and one of my favourites. Sir Waldo Hawkridge inherits Broom Hall in Yorkshire. He visits the house with his cousin Julian Lindeth and both of them quickly become popular in the neighbourhood most especially with Miss Tiffany Weild and the other young ladies in the area. But Sir Waldo seems to be more interested in Tiffany's companion Miss Ancilla Trent.I loved the characters in this novel - Ancilla and Sir Waldo especially. Mrs Underhill, Tiffany's aunt, is also excellent with her down to earth practicality and common sense. Tiffany herself is a monster of selfishness and probably one of Heyer's most unpleasant female creations but she is so unaware of her behaviour that people soon realise what she's like even though they are impressed by her looks when they first meet her.The dialogue and the plot are as ever extremely well done and no one can match Heyer for her portrayal of the Regency period with its different manners and morals."},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I read ALL the Georgette Heyer novels when I was a teenager - now thatthey've republished them so beautifully I'm reading them again - andthey're still as fun as they always were!!

The Nonesuch is my favorite, and the one I have reread with great pleasure. For fans of Jane Austen, Heyer does give off a similar feeling in her writing. I loved this book, and highly recommend it to others!"},{"Title":"The Nonesuch","review":"I am reading Georgette Heyer's books again. I first read them when I was a teenager 50 years ago. I think Ms Heyer was still alive, or had only recently died then. The one thing I wish were in her books was the original date of publication. From memory The Nonesuch was one of the first books of Ms. Heyer's that I reread, I was suitably impressed, certainly enough to find more to read.The book is placed for the most part in Yorkshire, which at this point in time started to see the appearance of the Neuveau Riche, who had made their money from the wool or other trades that were happening in the area. As always Georette Heyer is accurate historically, I like the difference between what is acceptable at a private dance and a public dance for example. The language used is correct, the minor characters are interesting in themselves. Laurence Calver for example definitely has my sympathy.Old Joseph Calver's will is a surprise to all his relations and a disappointment to most of them. Its consequences also cause a great stir in the parish of Oversett in the West Riding when the news arrives that Sir Waldo Hawkridge is coming north to inspect his inheritance, having been tricked into going, the late Mr Calver's decaying residence, Broom Hill. For Sir Waldo is the most discussed man in London Society, wealthy, handsome, still a bachelor, the acknowledged leader of the Corinthian set, and known as the Nonesuch for his athletic prowess.At the Manor and the Rectory, and particularly at Staples, the home of Mrs Underhill, where her tempestuous, beautiful niece, Tiffany Wield, and her governess-companion, Miss Ancilla Trent, are also living, there is excited anticipation of the increase in social activity which the presence of the Nonesuch will bring. The young men of the neighbourhood look forward to learning from him all the latest refinements of dress and the most daring new tricks to be performed with well-bred horses, while their elders express their doubts about the expensive habits in which they expect the None-such to encourage their wives and children. Both excitement and doubts increase when it is heard that Sir Waldo is accompanied by his young cousin, Lord Lindeth.Miss Heyer writes with her usual wit and grace of the commotion which the arrival of the two fashionable strangers inspires, of Sir Waldo's real intentions and of the unexpected train of events to which they lead. The Nonesuch ranks amongst the most entertaining and accomplished of her Regency romances.Miss Ancilla Trent is a wonderful 'heroine', the governess/companion of the beautiful heiress Tiffany Wield quite the most beautiful girl Sir Waldo has ever seen but whose personality by no means matches her looks.This is where the author's writing shines...Tiffany is an incredibly selfish and self-centred young woman, and Waldo and Ancilla frequently join forces in a hilarious manner in order to make her see the error of her ways - not to criticise her, for she would refuse to listen, but to persuade her that such behaviour would cause her to lose her looks, or to make the mythical Marquis she deserves,a completely made up creation whom she is sure will wish to marry her,to have a disgust of her.That is what eventually happens,despite everything Ancilla does to prevent it. The crowning touch is when Lord Lindeth who initially was so taken with Miss Wield, proposes to another girl not half as beautiful.Ancilla certainly finds Waldo's company congenial, but more than that, he makes her laugh. But it never occurs to her that his interest in her is any greater than the fact that she is intelligent and can actually make conversation - after all,he will return to London and forget all about the governess he knew briefly. However, she doesn't know Waldo and his determination...The 'Nonesuch' is a truly satisfying 'Regency' novel and I enjoyed reading it a second time as much as I did the first."},{"Title":"Anthony, the Perfect Monster","review":"Angelo DeCesare validates feelings real kids have by allowing his main character, Anthony, to be angry, sad, lonesome and happy - whatever the appropriate emotion is at the time.As a reading specialist, I have read this book with elementary school children.

Now he has suddenly remerged, on a self-styled stalk-and-kill errand of vengeance. Eight C.I.A. men are already dead. And Alec Gunther has been reactivated for a last-chance mission. With memories of his beautiful wife, Judith, a botched job in Berlin, and a year of disgrace still haunting him he stalks a fanatical killer. Racing across two continents on a twisted trail of intrigue, he must hunt, and be hunted by THE TASKMASTER.\\"This is my second Harold King novel following on the heels of The Hahnemann Sequela, and I must admit, I didn't enjoy The Taskmaster nearly as much as Sequela. That being said, The Taskmaster has a sweet sadness about it. Old ways must yield for better or worse to new ways. For maximum pleasure, The Taskmaster should be read slowly to savor Alec Gunther's observations about the past, the present, and how they relate/impact each other. Is experience worth anything in the light of new, expanding technologies? Two-thirds of the book is about the old master spy trying to redeem himself after a major career failure in Berlin and a failed marriage. Gunther pursues The Taskmaster, who he personally trained, across the landscape of the US to South America and back again in an attempt at stopping him from murdering all the former spies involved in the C.I.A.'s Jupiter project. In the remaining one-third of the book, nearly everything that had gone on before must be disregarded to get at the truth. I'm not sure I liked such a radial about face. However, given the developments in the last third of the book, in my opinion, the reader would have had must greater pleasure if Gunther had discussed in greater detail throughout the novel his love for Judith (his former wife) and the particulars about their failed marriage, and just what hurtles prevented their eventual reunion.A particularly interesting part of the book for me was the time Gunther spends in the mountains awaiting the murderous Taskmaster to strike. I would have liked the narrator/voice to have changed back and forth more than it did, with more information conveyed from The Taskmaster/murderer's point of view than Gunther's, because it was very obvious to me that my energy levels spiked when the murderer spoke. The time spent in the woods waiting for The Taskmaster to strike reminded me of Burt Hirschfeld's Father Pig where the hero waits in the woods preparing for the arrival of his murderous son."},{"Title":"Overcoming the Overwhelming","review":"Here is a booklet that takes you from a catastrophe that might be happening in your own life, and shows you how to interpret it in light of Scripture, in light of God's perspective for your life.You'll learn here how God knows what's happened, and is going to happen, in your life, and is in control, even of the \\"bad\\" things, to drive you to His comfort and conformity - for your good, and those in the future who'll be comforted by your intimate understanding of what's happening in their life.As the former Dean of Behavioral Science at Southern California Seminary, Dr. Ken Nichols now heads-up A.L.I.V.E.

While he gives an almost day-by-day blow of some of these films as they travel from film festival circuit to deal making to publicity tours - the real value is are the details about the process that one can expect as an independent film maker.Now, a decade later, many things have changed (especially the financing numbers and studio/distribution situation today versus the 1990s) - what hasn't changed is the overall process of what you might encounter and expect. Here's a great opportunity to read what they encountered and what lessons you might learn from them.The detailed summary on a deal-memo and points that they negotiated regarding the distribution contract and revenues from distribution and home video - are worth the price of a USC Film School class (not the whole education - the books not that great - just a excellent class :-)If you are a film fanatic and want to learn a portion of the nuts and bolts of the process of film festivals and independent distribution - you should find this book of interest.Why only three stars?

Who cares?!? What we really want is the inside story of all these independent films and filmmakers. Pierson seemed to lose track of who the stars of his book should be. I also found the author's writing and his overall knowledge of movies to be lacking. A much better book on the same broad topic is &quot;Celluloid Mavericks&quot; by Greg Merritt, which covers the entire history of American independent film from a much more literate and balanced perspective."},{"Title":"Spike, Mike, Slackers and Dykes: A Guided Tour Across a Decade of American Independent Cinema","review":"this is a long history of indie films. One thing the reader must know before reading this: if you are not interested in the aspects of filmmaking or an indie film buff, DO NOT READ THIS!

I did learn a lot (and I'm happy about that), but I was also confused much of the time. It would have certainly helped if I would have seen the movies he was detailing. He didn't write the book for people like me. He probably wrote it for people with already strong backgrounds in independent film.I predict it's a really good read if . . . you have seen loads (i mean loads!) of indie films since the \\"Stranger Than Paradise\\" (1984) and you already know about the directors and distributors of the post-1984 indie scene.If you don't feel like your an industry expert just yet, trying reading \\"Shooting to Kill\\" or \\"Down and Dirty Pictures.\\" They assume much less about the reader.

Not that I'm looking for a typical Hollywood put on the glitz and glamour type of book, but the book basically deals with how the author put together financing and got distribution for some indie films. It definitely could have been told in a more exciting way. The best thing about it is the interviews with Kevin Smith that are interspersed through the first half or so of the book. Then, they drop off, and I did as well. The author is definitely a huge fan of Kevin Smith, which is great, as there are a lot of Kevin's journal entries included about when Clerks was at Sundance. If you like Kevin Smith, this is a good read, if only for the interviews and the chapter about Clerks. If not, then well...you might like it, but it's a little dull.

And, true to the name, the book takes place in the heart of New England blueblood congregation spots in (presumably, given an offhand Falmouth reference) Massachusetts. And while the text generally reads as if William Makepeace Thackeray were trying his hand at a horror novel, the book does work on some levels as a sort of odd mix of drawing-room satire and existentialist suspense work.Hugh Murray, a man who married into money, is destined to spend a few weeks over the upcoming summer of 1976 at the house of his wife's aunt and uncle. The uncle's all right, but the aunt makes Hyacinthe Bucket (of Keeping Up Appearances fame) look like an unprincipled ninny in a housedress. Thankfully, we learn pretty early on, the rich aren't that much different, and the first few days go rather well, considering. The only really odd parts are the disturbing aunt and a strange, echoless screaming that occurs on foggy nights. One night, while Hugh is out walking, the fog rolls in, the screaming starts, and Hugh is in a place where he can investigate. He does, and as the result of his actions, he comes into possession of an odd little dog named Waffles. And that's when things start to get really weird.Brady's got a lot to say about such topics as emotional diseases, the horrors of inbreeding, the Roman Catholic Church, and other such things that are (at least, according to Brady) shunned on the surface by New England bluebloods while they turn around and indulge in them when they thing nobody's looking. He also seems to have a lot to say about pastoral life and whether it's worth living. Unfortunately, not enough of it comes together to really get his message across, and thus while the drawing-room satire bit does make for a few chuckles along the way, it never really coheres. We're left with the horror of existence. Here, flipping the coin, it seems almost as if Brady were trying too hard to make this into a bona fide horror novel while still wanting to keep his allegiance to Sartre intact, and instead of blending the two as he was seemingly attempting, he ends up getting about three-quarters of the way to the meeting point on each side. There's a gap in the middle, but the reader should have little problem figuring out where everything was supposed to come together.This novel is the literary equivalent of the rock and roll bootleg tape. If you can listen to a bootleg of your favorite band and visualize what the music would have sounded like had it been recorded from the board and put through extensive post-production, you'll probably be able to puzzle out what this novel should have been and appreciate it for that. Otherwise, it'll probably leave you wishing Brady had gone those extra steps. **"},{"Title":"Instar","review":"This book arrived in very good condition for an old (1976, I think) paperback, and, having read half of it, I would say it makes for a lively read.

What makes me wonder about whether I want to read it or not is a glaring error I noticed in an excerpt found on the PC Flank website where the author states:\\"While it did not carry a damaging payload, it did prove the concept that cross-platform Java viruses could be written. Strange Brew, however, affects only Java applications, not Java applets (the small Java scripts) that typically run inside a Web browser. Because the Java Virtual Machine has built-in security measures, it does not allow Java applets direct access to the hard disk nor the ability to modify applications. This prevented Strange Brew from reaching other Java code and causing harm.In January of 1999, the second known Java virus, called Java.BeanHive, was discovered. This virus was designed to infect both Java applets as well as Java applications. Remember, Java applets are small Java programs (written in Java Script) that are often used on Web sites that are downloaded and run by Web browsers while users surf the Internet.\\"While the author is probably correct about the particular Java viruses he mentioned, he is totally wrong about what Java is. Java != JavaScript. While Java and JS share a similar syntax on the basic language level (along with C++), they are not the same language at all. Java is not a scripting language and it is not JavaScript. They are two completely different languages and APIs.This makes me wonder what other uncaught mistakes are in the book and just how correct the author's facts, and therefore how correct his conclusions are."},{"Title":"I Saw the Sky Catch Fire (Plume Contemporary Fiction)","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read- and I read a lot of books!

I consider myself pretty informed about political and social topics, yet I had little idea that Title IX does not just cover equality in sporting opportunities. Title IX, the brainchild of late Congresswoman Edith Green, actually mandates that schools may not limit the educational opportunities of students based on gender--and that includes admissions policies and access to classes. Title IX is the reason that half of all law students and medical students today are women.What a huge change from the early 1960s, the era in which Blumenthal opens the book with a description of swimmer Donna De Verona. The 13-year-old swimmer, long denied opportunities to participate in other sports she loved, finally decided to become a swimmer. Not only did she excel, but she became the most decorated high school swimmer in the United States. She won two Olympic gold medals and the adoration of the press. Then she graduated, and...nothing. No scholarships, no endorsements, no interest. Here was an 18-year-old brimming with talent and she hit a dead end because there simply were no rewards for women athletes.At the time De Verona was facing her bleak future, women all over the country were confounded by colleges that had strict admissions quotas. Many schools refused to enroll women in science and math classes. And legislators could get away with citing the need for \\"delicate\\" females to leave educational spaces open for men, who would be the \\"breadwinners.\\"Things changed, and they changed quickly. A little too quickly for institutions such as Harvard University, which comes off poorly in this book. These stodgy and hidebound schools tried their hardest to keep women from upsetting their little alumni-donation applecart (women alumni were said not to give money to the colleges). Coaches went ballistic when they realized they'd have to share space and dollars with female athletes. And shrill voices predicted shared locker rooms and the end of the feminine mystique.But then came Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs and the famous \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" tennis match. It captured the imagination of the nation and a generation was galvanized to not allow women second-class status any longer.Now, here we are in 2005 and the world has changed for the better. Title IX is still controversial with football coaches and a few other macho types who'd like all the money and attention focused on men. But America has taken to female soccer players (Mia Hamm), tennis favorites (the Williams sisters), basketball players (too many to mention) and also with female doctors and lawyers. It's all part of the current cultural landscape and there's no going back.Blumenthal does a great job bringing the law to life by providing mamny break-out boxes with stories of female athletes and legislators that made a difference. Would you believe Caspar Weinberger, Richard Nixon's conservative head of the old department of Health, Education and Welfare, was instrumental in getting Title IX signed and implemented? Can you believe that Nixon signed it? All these stories are true and come to vivid life in Blumenthal's straightforward style of storytelling.She doesn't pull any punches and she shouldn't have to. What was unfair needed to be rectified. Today's kids who are growing up in a nearly egalitarian society need to know that they are standing on the shoulders of some pretty courageous and forward-thinking human beings.I recommend that if you have a daughter, niece, grandchild, little sister, or just that cute neighbor girl down the street, this book would make an excellent addition to her library."},{"Title":"Let Me Play: The Story of Title IX: The Law That Changed the Future of Girls in America","review":"I consider myself quite well informed about current women's issues, but had always wondered what the impetus was behind Title IX. I had no idea that the law we hear about that applies to women's equal access to sports, was aimed at equal access to college admissions and financial assistance. I cried several time while reading this book; I was mad at the earlier treatment of women, I was saddened by the personal stories of disappointment suffered by the women who were shut out of playing games they loved only because they were girls. I was also proud of the triumphs of the recent past, but mostly I was moved to buy another copy and pass it around to as many women as I can.

Laurie in Utah"},{"Title":"Let Me Play: The Story of Title IX: The Law That Changed the Future of Girls in America","review":"\\"Female admissions to colleges and graduate programs picked up speed, driven by female ambition, the law, and a growing acceptance that it was simply wrong to reject someone just for being a girl. Between 1971 and 1976 the number of women attending college jumped 40 percent. By the fall of 1976 one in every four law students was a woman, up from fewer than one in ten in 1971; likewise, a quarter of first-year medical students were female, up from about one in seven just five years before.\\"Recently at this year's Book Expo in New York City, I had the pleasure of meeting and conversing with Patricia Macias. At publishing conventions, Patricia is known as the wife of author Ben Saenz. But back home in El Paso, she is more frequently referred to as \\"Your Honor.\\"As I wandered the exhibition halls at Book Expo, I frequently got the chance to catch up with old friends in the publishing industry. Many of the women I've known for years who are employed by the large publishing houses now have titles like \\"President & Publisher\\" or \\"Vice President and Associate Publisher.\\" They not only have the positions; they have the power that accompanies those titles.I also had the opportunity at Book Expo to chat briefly with my favorite member of the United States Senate. I feel so fortunate to be represented by Barbara Boxer who, like me, grew up in New York and moved westward. When we first elected Barbara to the US Senate in 1992, having her join Diane Feinstein there in representing California, it was the first time in US history that two women Senators were representing the same state at the same time.Myra Bradwell would have though that it was long past time.\\"In 1869, Mrs. Bradwell passed the Illinois bar exam with high honors and turned in her application to practice law. Though she easily qualified, she was turned down because she was a married woman. She filed a lawsuit, but the Illinois Supreme Court turned her down too, saying that her sex was 'a sufficient reason for not granting this license.'\\"In one of the nation's first sex discrimination cases she appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. But America's top court had a different view than she did. 'Man is, or should be, woman's protector and defender,' the Court wrote in 1873. 'The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life.' It concluded: 'The paramount destiny and mission of woman [is] to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.' \\"It does not require looking back a hundred and something years to the life of Myra Bradwell (who, we learn, persevered to become America's first female lawyer) in order to recall when things were really unfair for women in America. I grew up a youngster not all THAT long ago, in a world where women didn't have the same opportunities as men to go to college, didn't have the same opportunities as men to work in many fields, to attain the highest positions in business, government, or education, to get paid the same money for the same work, and sure as heck didn't have the same athletic opportunities as their male counterparts.As recalled in LET ME PLAY by Karen Blumenthal, it was in 1964 (when I turned nine, the same year the Beatles first came to America), that a Southern segregationist in Congress unintentionally played an important role in promoting women's rights when he \\"proposed adding the word 'sex' to the section [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964], so that it would forbid job discrimination against women as well as blacks.\\" Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia was figuring that adding such an amendment would cause the male-dominated Congress to quickly sink the entire Act including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the historic Civil Rights legislation would create. That Smith's plan backfired and the legislation passed meant for the first time in our history that it was illegal to pay a woman differently than a man employed in the same position as she.\\"State universities in Virginia had turned away 21,000 women in the early 1960s; during the same time not a single man was turned away.\\"While the author takes us back to the 1800s and forward to the 1960s in setting the stage, the overwhelming focus of her fascinating and important book about women in America is on the fight for passage of and subsequent fights over enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as well as the far-reaching changes in our country that resulted from that landmark legislation.Blumenthal's well-documented story of Title IX is interspersed with illuminating profiles and photos of notable twentieth century female athletes who got badly cheated by being born in the backward days of the earlier 1900s, along with great profiles of the federal legislative heroes responsible for Title IX passage, and a terrific assortment of strips from Doonsbury, Tank McNamara, Peanuts and other daily comics and political cartoons that shed light on the legislation and the issues behind it.\\"At the University of Georgia the budget for women's sports grew to $120,000 in 1978 from $1,000 in 1973, but the men received $2.5 million. Among the differences: The men on the golf team got all the golf balls they needed. Women golfers got one for each competitive round they played.\\"If the words of the \\"stupid white men\\" on the Supreme Court in the 1870s seem like something from the Dark Ages, readers will discover that the ignorance of those words is easily matched by what Ronald Reagan and his minions did to try and destroy Title IX in the 1980s. I can't imagine any woman who's aware of what Reagan and Bush One carried out in those years not gagging over the current President's recent words that \\"We are blessed to live in a Nation, and a world, that have been shaped by the will, the leadership, and the vision of Ronald Reagan.\\" I'd say there's a serious lack of vision when you've got your head in the place that Reagan obviously had his when it came to women's rights.But now the question is, is the battle finally won?When we consider what portion of Congress and Senate seats are currently filled by the majority gender in America, when we look at what portion of the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations are female, or when we look at the gender of the Presidents of the nation's most distinguished universities, we must conclude that there is a long way to go.A report released by the AAUW back when this week's high school graduates were in kindergarten found that \\"boys' expectations were built up while girls' were whittled back.\\" That's THIS generation, not mine or a previous generation.And lest anyone suggest the glass half-filled attitude, I'd hasten to suggest that they consider trading places and then claim that things are moving along quickly enough.Edith Green, a major figure in the story, was fond of the saying: \\"The trouble with every generation is that they haven't read the minutes of the last meeting.\\" Thanks to Karen Blumenthal, we now have an accurate set of minutes available from a pivotal episode in recent American history."},{"Title":"Let Me Play: The Story of Title IX: The Law That Changed the Future of Girls in America","review":"I'm so glad to see a history for today's young women about what it was like before Title 9 - which, while it wasn't that long ago, seems unreal to my daughter's generation.

(and instructional time was used to move the tables and chairs aside)In a day when feminism is facing a hostile backlash, Ms. Blumenthal's book is a valuable reminder that \\"what used to be\\" wasn't as rosy as some claim, a reminder of the gains made in sports by talented girls, and of what we DON'T want to return to!

There are some more interesting side bars, and I really enjoyed the charts of statistics showing how the numbers of girls and women in different areas of sports and education increased every year following passage of the law.

Author Karen Blumenthal presents her work in a format targeted to a young audience, making this easily manageable book appealing to people of all ages that appreciate the continuing battle for equal rights.Let Me Play is not simply the history of Title IX, part of the 1972 education amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but an outline of the ongoing fight women have endured in demanding equal treatment. It tells the stories of women all over the country fighting for recognition as something more than homemakers. Let Me Play fervently depicts, through narration, anecdotes, pictures and cartoons, the ways women fought, and still fight, for status as equal humans of equal worth.In her book, Blumenthal vividly profiles the lives of many empowered women from soccer superstar Mia Hamm, who grew up playing on boys' soccer and American football teams, to 1993 University of Louisville Medical School graduate Dot Richardson, Olympic softball gold medalist and orthopedic surgeon. The stories of these women are heartening and relatable. No matter their field or occupation, each of them was once a girl growing up in a boy's world.Let Me Play is a powerful addition to the unique genre of children's books adopted by Blumenthal, celebrated author and Wall Street Journal reporter. She has a way of capturing the meaning and relative application of a major historical event and conveying it in a way that is straightforward and dynamic, educational and entertaining.Let Me Play is, essentially, the very recent, very true and very shocking story of girls being denied the right to not only participate in school-sanctioned sports and activities but also to take top-level math and science classes and be admitted to top universities, solely because of their gender.The underlying message of Let Me Play is this: Know the words of Title IX and remember that, by law, no one can deny you the right to play, learn, advance and win.A fiery and well examined recounting of the road to equality for women peppered with fun political cartoons and unforgettable quotes, this book is a necessity for any girl who plays ball in a once strictly male park."},{"Title":"THE STREET SPARROWS","review":"I bumped into this book in my high school library and have loved it ever scince.

Also included is Angle who is so called \\"because e' aint one\\" and \\"Laird Charles\\", Megs beloved; and a finer man I don't think ever realy existed. Of course there is Gordie, the seemingly unstopable intelegent criminal in whos claws Meg and Jamie find themselvs. The book is told from the standpoint of Meg during her first 17 and 1/2 years and, as you would hope, the author (Rose Ayers) truly captures the innocent wanderings and notions of a young inquisitive mind.I have read this book to my mother (of 53, i hope she doesnt know i told!) and some of my young friends around 13 to 15 and EVERYONE Beged to borrow the book! My mother was entranced by the beauty and charm of the language style Rose Ayers uses and it was more fun to read it out loud that i would have ever imagined. Here is a small excerpt:\\"at once I was conscious of being the centre of a circumference of observation. Wherever I succeeded in piercing the general gloom, there appeared the outline of a man in ragged coat, torn vest, or ripped shirt, dirty cap askew, pipe or mug in hand, and alert animal-like eyes inspecting me. Without the massive hulk of Mr. William Higginbottom at my side, I might have found the situation alarming. As it was, I was rather intrigued: I had never attracted so much attention before...... He was still examining me. So was the other man. So was another who had sauntered up to the end of the table. So were two more, farther down our table. So, I felt, was every man in the room, far too many of them were decidedly large, and all of them seemed to be coming closer. this was too much of a good thing, and i felt my cheeks getting hot and my backbone quivery.At last Robbie spoke out of the depths of his consideration. \\"Bloody small, ain't she, Will?\\"This was too much. Wasn't I taller than that pudgy little shrimp of a betty, and she a good year older than I? Was I ALWAYS to be called too small? \\"I am NOT bloody small,\\" I exclaimed. \\"It's just that you're all bloody big.\\" The whoops and shouts of laughter that resulted left me greatly insulted. What were they all howling about? I'D said nothing funny, only the exact truth, and as for the word \\"bloody,\\" which admittedly was not current at Miss Godfrey's (though I had once or twice heart it uttered on the pavement in front of the shops where I sometimes had gone with Em), THEY had used it first and therefore hadn't the right to be so particular. I was blushing hotly, though in that redolent gloom I don't suppose anyone noticed, and my bottom lip was beginning to tremble when one rough voice boomed out of the chaos. \\"Yer the right kind of girr-el, yer are, an' I drinks to yer, I does.\\" ....This is the most entrancing book I have EVER read, and I've read a Good Many. I recomend it to EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"THE STREET SPARROWS","review":"It has been some time since I have read this book, however I will endevor to recall the material in order to supply anyone wishing to read it with an unbiased and hopefully helpful judgment of its worth. The story is charming, the plot is passable, but in true Dickens' fashion it is the characters that give the book life and mystery. Set in London in the nineteenth century (most resembling the period in which Dickens' characters lived) this is the tale of an unlikely girl and her growing melange of friends and family as they survive in the squalid, corrupt and underhanded London streets.Truly reminiscint of Oliver Twist and other of Dickens' works, it supplies such characters as the spunky but reserved heroine, her amazing lad who may not be all he seems to be and the mysterious but captivating \\"Angel\\", a young man who works as a chimney sweep but harbors an obsession with the sea. If you are a fan of Dickens but don't quite have the patience or fortitude to make it through his classics you may enjoy The Street Sparrows as modern and faster paced alternative."},{"Title":"THE STREET SPARROWS","review":"I was very impressed with the quality of this book.

It also came shortly after the order was placed."},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"Jesus said that the religious leaders of his day made the word of God ineffective by incorporating it with the traditions of men. In this book Rory Moore takes aim at perhaps the most sacred tradition in the modern church, the tradition of tithing.In most churches today tithing is taught as if it were the first commandment. Moore meticulously debunks the myth of New Testament tithing by using the pure word of God. This book is full of scriptural truth. Point by point, line upon line, precept upon precept the author refutes every argument used by todays church leaders for extracting the tithe from the people.If you are satisfied with the traditions of men do not read this book. But if you want to truth from the word of God free of mens traditions this is a great place to start"},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"If you can't handle truth, avoid this book. But if you are willing to study a very scriptural case in regard to tithing, this is a must read. When I first heard about this book, I was 100% a sceptic a doubter that anyone could prove tithing different from my church teaching. About halfway through the book, I began to realize how deeply we had been committed to something that had not a single verse in the New Covenant given to any church or Christian telling them to tithe. I was in shock. Then other related subjects in regard to what the storehouse is, church buildings which cost so much and have little or nothing to do with Christianity yet that is what takes the majority of church income, along with salaries. A little more documentation would have been helpful in regard to financial abuse, and some points were a bit redundant. The real shocker was after reading this, the following Sunday the pastor taught on tithing from Abraham to Melchizedek. Clearly seeing he was propping up a false teaching that benefitted him personally, I never went back."},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"I belonged to a church for over 10 years where over 80% of the sermons preached were about tithing and you were cursed if you didn't tithe. The tithe was God's and then you were blessed on what you gave beyond the tithe. They even went as far as to say that you wouldn't go in the rapture if you didn't tithe! Most of the members were middle class to poor but were told that's how they would get out of poverty was by giving their way out. When the pastor left after selling off the property that he spent 10 years fund raising for, it left what was left of the church scraping by. Many members left disgruntled and the dream of this great mega church in shambles.This book was a refreshing revelation of what God expects of the church in our giving as oppposed to what was drilled into us all those years. I never questioned it before, but after reading this book and researching scripture, it couldn't be more true."},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"Very informative and the truth of the scriptures out in the open! Mr. Moore places the challenge right on the table that everyone should study for themselves what the bible says, about giving. I first heard about this book via an internet radio interview that Mr. Moore was on. The interview was VERY informative but to get the information in book form is even better."},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"This book is written (in my opinion)as a testimony of the light that God has shown the author. The reader is to be aware that the author is from a Pentacostal background, and as such, is hampered by that groups doctrinal errors (such as possibly losing his salvation, page 102). However, his message on the abusivness of the current, popular teaching on tithing is very good. This book is a good read. I only gave it 4 stars because of the doctrinal errors and the authors misunderstanding of Malachi. He is correct on how it is abused, but he missed the truth of Malachi chapter 3. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"Rory takes scripture from the Bible and uses it well to blast out of the water the \\"methods\\" many churches use to get their members to tithe. Of course there is much more dialogue in the book about money and seeing the Lord provide through faith and what He has and hasn't said regarding finances of the church and it's people. This was an eye opener for me and even though I wanted to.....I couldn't debate any points because it would have been totally going against scripture. Just let go of your preconceived ideas and openly let the Lord Jesus speak to you through Rory's book. It's anointed of God."},{"Title":"The Tithe That Binds","review":"This book is powerful, scriptural, every pastor and every member of every church should read this book.

Each new subject that the author would talk about would be scattered throughout the chapter instead of being in the near paragraphs to follow.

By the way the software it comes with is not all that. It's just a review with cheap graphics.

The study guide has an overview of the book, with pictures and video clips of computer animated sequences of cell function, muscle function, and many other things. It also has activities in which you click and drag answers for study sheets. At the end of each section there is a quiz, with randomly selected questions from the study material, and at the end of a chapter a unit exam. This helped me tremendously in preparing for tests.

It's original and main intent is aimed at high school teachers who are preparing students for college. In this vein it addresses what should be tought to students and how they should be taught.The second goal is how to take whatever high school education a young person has and from this foundation prepare the student for what college is going to be like.Unfortunately the taking of the college preparatory curriculum in most high schools does a fairly poor job of actually preparing students for surviving in the college environment. Perhaps the knowledge the student has in math, english, or whatever is adequate. But there is still the lack of involvement on the teachers part, particularly in the large survey type classes of a hundred plus students with a TA doing the teaching. Combine this with the faster pace, the increased requirements for homework, and the outside influences away from home and the potential is there for significant problems.This book is a more basic guide than many of the college review type books that merely list some attributes of dozens of colleges. This is a guide on how to succeed rather than how to pick a college."},{"Title":"College Knowledge: What It Really Takes for Students to Succeed and What We Can Do to Get Them Ready","review":"Because I work with underserved students and their college counselors, I bought this book to do research.

His \\"Poet in New York\\" is quite different. It contains surrealist impressions of his time in the titular city. Both exhibit the quality of \\"duende\\" for which Lorca is justly acclaimed. If you are not already familiar with these two world-famous works, you might want to look for editions that have English translations on facing pages. \\"Poet in New York\\" can get especially involved.This book looks like the type used in high school classrooms. It is hardback, but the pages are cheap and pulpy. Oh well. I plan to write English glosses in all the margins anyway. It's great to get two of Lorca's masterpieces together and at this price. Beware: it took two months for them to ship this. I think they have to order it special because it is printed in Madrid. The book also contains a prologue by Carlos Bousono-- also (por supuesto) in Spanish."},{"Title":"Chinese Enterprise, Transnationalism and Identity (Chinese Worlds)","review":"Taking a culturalist view in my research and teaching, this anti-culturalist book caught my eye. It starts from the premise that culture has no influence on business and management, and fails to prove it, sometimes attempting to prove the thesis by ignoring culture. All competent researchers are aware that outcomes from data analyses can be tailored to support a premise by what you measure, what results you choose to report, and what you say about them. I pass on the Book Review by Gordon Redding, Euro-Asia and Comparative Research Centre, INSEAD, in 'The China Journal', Jul 2005., Iss. 54; pg. 186, 4 pgs: Redding notes that 'this book flows from commissioned research designed to provide the evidence that culture and common ethnic identity do not determine decision-making in business. The aim and the tone are set unambiguously in the statement that \\"the assertion we make in this volume is precisely the opposite to the argument adopted in the 'culturalist perspective', i.e. that culture is a determining factor in how ethnic Chinese undertake business ventures and develop their firms\\" (p. xiv). Note: it is not just that culture is challenged for being proposed as the determining factor; it is not even going to be allowed to be a determining factor. From the outset, we are in the hands of people with a mission, so the warning in the preface is valuable.''Overall, the problem with the book is that instead of asking modestly how much of the explanation is economic, how much political, how much cultural, and so on, an absolutist cultural argument is erected as a straw man and savagely bayoneted. I know of almost no culturalists who make the claims of explanatory dominance which are assumed here at the outset and that go back to the original Weberian account. What is needed is not an opposite and clearly announced bias, but a search for fusion, for genuine socio-economics. This book fails to provide it.'Somewhat similar comments are made by Henry Wai-chung Yeung, in Journal of Contemporary Asia; 2005; 35, 2; ProQuest Asian Business and Referencepg. 272-273."},{"Title":"Underground Clinical Vignettes: Pharmacology: Classic Clinical Cases for USMLE Step 1 Review","review":"This is the worst book of the series and is a waste of time.

The reader of Sewall's life of Emily Dickinson will find himself in that mortal's place.This is a book to buy and keep and turn to again and again. Whenever you need to remind yourself what the English language can do, open a page at random and ED will show you. On her own confusion: &quot;I am out with lanterns, looking for myself.&quot; On youth: &quot;when I was but an unsifted girl, and you so scholarly.&quot; On Shakespearean partings: &quot;I read them in the garret and the rafters wept.&quot;Sewall's scholarship is impeccable, his writing graceful, his sympathy and critical engagement exemplary. If you don't own any volumes of Dickinson's poetry, this biography can serve as a &quot;selected works&quot; since it contains many of the poems and letters in their entirety. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of possessing this book."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"I have just read this book and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, the title is somewhat misleading, as this is not a conventional biography. Other than a few chapters on her childhood and early education, the book is arranged in \\"theme\\" chapters, each focussing on a particular person or aspect of her life, illustrated, and heavily annotated, with letters and poems related to that theme.I ended the book with more questions about her life than I had at the beginning. Many of them are barely addressed in the book, or just hinted at. Perhaps the book was intended for readers who are already very familiar with the biographical details.Just as one example, the author mentions several times the eye problem that led to one of Emily's rare trips away from her home for treatement in Boston. I kept thinking that sooner or later some further details about this eye problem would be revealed, but there was never more than a few widely scattered sentences about it. Perhaps there isn't enough evidence to be able to conjecture as to the nature of the problem, but the author doesn't even seem to think it's an important enough detail to require a weighing of the evidence.Likewise her mother's long illness, which played a role in Emily's withdrawal from the world, is mentioned but its nature is not discussed, other than a mention that she was paralyzed near the end of her life. Did she suffer a stroke? Was she lucid? Since Emily was her primary caregiver, it would seem that these details might bear on her own emotional state during the years of this illness and would warrant at least some speculation.Even Emily's own final illness remains a mystery. We learn that her sister blamed it on the ill treatment received from her sister-in-law, and that her doctor attributed it to \\"nerves\\". However, from other hints, it seems to be a progessively debilitating illness. There is never as much as a paragraph in the entire book which speculates on the nature of this fatal illness or how much she might have been incapacitated between the first attack in June 1884 and her death in May 1885. \\"Nerves\\" seems to me to be an insufficient explanation for the death of the poet after an illness of eleven months. Are we sure the fainting spell was related to the final illness? Was she ill for the entire eleven months? For how long was she bedridden? The author doesn't even pose these questions.In a book of 821 pages, there is no index entry for \\"illness\\". \\"Death [of ED]\\" has 7 widely scattered and brief entries, one of which is a footnote, one of which is a 13-sentence entry on how her death affected her brother, one of which is the text of her obituary and three of which describe her funeral(on pages 273, 575 and 667, to show how scattered they are). The seventh entry refers to her obituary, but seems to be a mistake, as I find no mention of her death or obituary on the page cited.The book is especially good on the life of her brother Austin, and is also good on her father. Her mother and sister remain mysterious, probably because they were not much more exposed to public scrutiny than Emily herself was. It is obvious that her sister was nearly as much of a recluse as Emily, or at least was perceived as such by their neighbors.In such a scattered book, there is inevitably a good deal of repetition of details. The three mentions of Emily's funeral cited above, for example, are mostly identical. Poems are also quoted in part or in their entirety multiple times.There is an index of the poems and the pages on which they are discussed, which is useful for understanding the context of some of these, although the author acknowledges that the dating of the poems presents many problems.There is a chronology at the beginning of the book, which really is the closest there is to a temporal ordering of the poet's life. I would suggest photocopying it and using it as a bookmark, because there is little chronological ordering, even within chapters at times. I found myself asking such things as, \\"Was this before her brother's marriage or after? Was her father still alive when this happened?\\" As a matter of fact, because I didn't have the chronology in front of me, I was surprised to realize, when I had almost finished the book, that Emily's father was still alive during the period of her most intense literary activity. After the early chapter devoted to her father's life, he is not often mentioned again, and I had somehow remained with the impression that he had died much earlier in her life.Much as I enjoyed this book, I am left wanting another book to fill in the gaps. However, I learned enough about the partisanal nature of her biographers to be wary of choosing one."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"THE LIFE OF EMILY DICKINSON. By Richard B. Sewall. 821 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press. First Harvard University Press paperback edition, 1994. ISBN 0-674-53080-2Although I haven't yet finished reading Richard B. Sewalls mammoth saga, I fully expect to one day, and I've certainly read enough to realize that this is the single most important biography of Dickinson that we have, and unlikely ever to be bettered.One thing that strikes me is Sewall's wonderful knack of bringing the various actors in this strange domestic drama vividly before us, and making them real and believable. The marvelous collection of illustrations in this book also help make the world of Amherst real to us.The book is comprehensive and a mine of interesting facts about anything and everything to do with Emily Dickinson, and is happily free of the unctuousness of Thomas H. Johnson's earlier biography. Besides being richly illustrated with an abundance of photographs, it is also well-written, incredibly well-researched, and is a pleasure to read, being well-printed on excellent smooth paper.In other words, Sewall's prize-winning biography is essential reading for all students of Dickinson, and is no doubt destined for a wide readership in its compact new paperback format which conveniently gives us Sewall's two volumes in one."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"Professor Sewall spent about 20 years getting this massive and beautifully presented biography put together, and his scholarship, devotion, persistence and talent shine in every chapter. He used original source material, much of it for the first time anywhere. He describes the lives of many Dickinsons, ancestors and descendants, of the mysterious poet...and getting to know these people helps us comprehend her art and her life. This book came out about l974, and was the first to reveal the now-famous adultery of Emily's brother Austin and Mable Loomis Todd, wife of the Amherst College astronomy professor. This doomed and illicit love lasted 13 years and was a key factor in how and when Emily's poems got published. We didn't get ALL of them until 69 years after the writer died, and Sewall's book tells us why. Professor Sewall hews to common sense in examining Emily's love life, her reclusiveness, and her probable sexual orientation. While he admits that abuse in childhood is possible as a factor in Emily's later choices or limitations, he clearly shows that it is also improbable. I have depended on this work in my own E.D. researches over a 20-year period, and corresponded with the author on and off for about ten years, although I never met him. In my opinion, any study of Emily BEGINS with this book if one wants to do it right. Buy it before it finally goes out of print or you will be sorry. It is a complex and magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"Somewhere among the 800 pages of this tome is a great 250-page biography. Mr. Sewall has assembled a massively detailed account of ED's life. I know presenting myriad detail of a subject's life is the biographer's method for removing themselves from the reader's relationship and experience of the subject, but I find this current trend of unleashing 800 to 1200 page biographies very taxing on the general reader. Although I wasn't completely disappointed in Mr. Sewall's biography, I was hoping for a tighter depiction of ED's life. I'm a general reader, not an academician. I was simply looking for an account of ED's life that would help me better understand her sublime poetry. This book delivered too much matter and not enough essence for me. However, the final chapter of the book entitled \\"The Poet\\" was very enlightening and poignantly written. This last chapter deserves 5 stars, the rest of the book 2."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"I was surprised to find this book so highly rated by other reviewers. I found it frustrating--Mr. Sewell spends a great deal of time and effort telling about different theories for events in Emily Dickinson's life, and then telling the reader that \\"I don't think that can be true\\". However, he never seemed to give any of his own answers to this enigmatic life. This is the first biography I have read about ED, and I come away greatly puzzled . . ."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"Poor misunderstood Emily Dickinson! I too said \\"What?\\" when I started reading her poems in earnest a few weeks ago. But thanks to this biography, I'm far less bewildered than I was at first.Richard Sewell clued me in to Dickinson's metaphors, cadence, passions, obsessions, sense of humor - and her unconventional approach to cosmic questions. And he taught me to ignore the titles of her poems, all affixed by editors, and all limiting.This biography is a combination of critical help with reading Dickinson's poetry -- and a picture of her life and personality.Sewall's approach to actual biography is highly original. He maintains that, \\"The whole truth about Emily Dickinson will elude us always.\\" There is too much myth. There are not enough verifiable facts. She was too protective of her privacy, and well-meaning relatives destroyed too many papers. So Sewall gets at the poet by describing her family, her friends, her mentors, the men she loved - and the intense relationships she had with them all. He effectively squashes the myth that she went into seclusion because of a love disaster. He portrays her as a confident artist with a strong sense of vocation who never let anything (love included) interfere with the poetry. To me, the portrait he paints is far more appealing than the tragic Emily Dickinson we meet elsewhere.So this is a wonderful book, but be warned: it's almost overwhelmingly detailed. It's obvious that Sewall had trouble leaving anything out from his vast stores of knowledge about the poet. The biographer delivers Dickinson's life circuitously, perhaps following the poet's advice to \\"Tell the truth, but tell it slant -- / Success in Circuit lies.\\" While most Dickinson scholars grope for certainties, Sewall is comfortable with probabilities and cautious scholarly deductions.Still, despite the heavy scholarship of this book, it does include all the juicy doings in Dickinson's inner circle: her brother's unhappy marriage, his extramarital affair, her sister's romantic disappointment, and her own repeated losses in friendship and love.I got this book from a university library, but I'd recommend buying it if you're serious about Dickinson. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"The Life of Emily Dickinson","review":"If you are looking to buy just one biography of this great poet, this is the one to buy.

The author's analysis of some poems can be questioned (whose cannot?), but the wealth of material presented is incredible. This is THE reference book about her life.

Although, the book is a rainbow of jokes, its author tenderly imbibed it with wit, tragicomic wisdom and heart felt expressions. Most certainly, country clubs members, tennis players and Waintrup's father enjoyed the stories told in the book and Waintrup's entertaining style. But this is the beginning of the enjoyment, for the \\"humanistic\\" humour, and delightful narrative style of \\"It's Not My Fault\\" will appeal to a wider and multi-layered audience, Jews and non-Jews, tennis lovers and Mercedes owners, martini mixers, Bernard Shaw's fanatics and Donald Trump's groupies.\\"It's Not My Fault\\" is fun, fun, fun....and entertainingly informative. The book is an umbrella for a stormy weather and a rod in an arid Sahara. It encompasses various and unexpected portraiture of life, usually un-depicted on the tennis court, such as growing up in a rabbi's house, getting paid to play tennis, celebrity correspondence, mingling with pretty girls on\\" the set\\", the ex-wife who begs to differ, how old pros never die, instead, they go to business school, a shrink's book and notebook, the art of winning, justice or lack of justice in the world. You name it and you will find it in Waintrup's tragicomic book. Of course, you will see the world according to Waintrup.Waintrup has a lot of imagination. But he candidly admits that thousands of unique, often crazy students and friends provided him with \\"the inspiration for much of the material\\" of his book. This is a plus. For certainly, unique and crazy enthusiasts who believed in Waintrup could and would add an extra mile of laughter and excitement to this most wonderful \\"crazy and captivating\\" book.

You will get a kick out of the many humerous stories he tells, lists of excuses, and funny quirks about the people who take tennis lessons from Mr. Country Club Tennis Pro.

And without realizing it perhaps you'll learn a few things about life even if your serve never improves. Mr. Waintrup pokes gentle fun at the Jewish country club set, setting himself up as the target of a joke more often than not.Take for example, the Definitive List of Country Club Drills, number thirteen. \\"The 'Hit the Pro\\"' drill, or as it's commonly known 'Maim that Pro' \\". Variations are \\"Aim for the Pickle\\" (nose) and \\"Mash the Matzah Ball\\". Daniel Waintrup offers himself up as a moving target for his student, relatives, and occasionally, even for his wife. Nothing is sacred - not even the cars in the parking lot as outlined in drill seventeen : \\"Hit the Mercedes, Hit the Porsche\\" drill. A junior student in this drill can also make points creatively by hitting a passing golf cart or setting off a car alarm.Buy this book, read it, laugh, then read it all over again.

Daniel I. Waintrup employs a tongue and cheek approach to the telling of his life as a Rabbi's son, tennis pro, husband, and father.No one is safe from his quick wit, to include himself.As an instructor at a New England country club, Waintrup had a unique way of teaching. Throughout the story he introduces his readers to his various clients (whose only common ground seemed to be that they were rich) with a selection of letters. Reader beware he doesn't answer in Dear Abby style.His life makes a full circle as he takes the reader from high school to college to the country club, and then back to college again.Waintrup's style is all his own. His humor is at times biting, often sarcastic, but always entertaining. The reader need not be into tennis to enjoy this novel -- just being into life works.

This book is the life of one of St Francis' earliest companions, Giles. Giles was well known during the Middle Ages for being a mystic and for his pithy sayings about God.Giles was in many ways the opposite of Francis. He was tall and enduring, and came from poverty, whereas Francis was frail and charming and raised in wealth.They both embraced Lady Poverty with determination. They slept out doors, had no money, rags for clothes, and begged for food. At first they were viewed with hostility and were as likely to be beaten as given a crust of bread.For his first decades as a Franciscan Giles tramped through much of Europe and even made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Many of the other early Franciscans lived short lives. Some were martyrs. Eventually his friend Francis, by then blind, starved, and suffering from the stigmata, died.But Giles, always sturdy, lived another twenty years as a monk, spending most of his time in prayer. He began to have visions. And there were miracles, and prophecies.By the time he was finally ready to die, he was so famous that a delegation arrived to make sure they could claim his body as a relic. Giles' reaction will make you smile.What a pity this book is no longer easily available."},{"Title":"Franciscan mystic;: The life of Blessed Brother Giles of Assisi, companion of St. Francis,","review":"This is a really well written book about Blessed Brother Giles, a Franciscan Brother that lived and traveled with Saint Francis.

Book arrived in on time and in very good condition."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I have to start by saying that I'm a big fan of most of Nora Roberts' trilogies and other groupings of books about families. That said, some are definitely better than others, and for me, this one was one of the best.&quot;Daring to Dream&quot; is the first of this trilogy about &quot;sisters of the heart&quot; -- three women who grew up together in the same household. Margo Sullivan is the heroine of this tale, and she has spent most of her life trying to shed the &quot;housekeeper's daughter&quot; mantle that she wears with no small chip on her shoulder. She has made a name for herself in modeling and has traveled the world, but when her career falls apart she knows there's only one place she can go, and that's &quot;home&quot;.Many readers who didn't care for this book seem to have felt that Margo was selfish and self-centered. While I agree on the latter, I wouldn't say that she was selfish at all. It was very clear that while she's very &quot;me&quot; oriented, she would have dropped anything at any time to help her friends if they needed her. She's an extremely realistic character, and that means that she is, of course, flawed. Those closest to her are always quick to point out her flaws -- in fact, she often refers to them herself. But her best trait, they agree, is her loyalty, and this makes her the kind of person most people would want as a friend.I also really enjoyed the love story in this book. Josh Templeton, the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to a hotel fortune and her best friend's brother to boot, isn't at all the spoiled jet-setting playboy that some have said. In fact, he works ultra-hard during the course of the book to prove his own worth, to show that he deserves his success and is not just a trust-fund baby. He was the perfect match for Margo and it was sweeter (and all the more realistic) that he has loved her all his life.A wonderful beginning to the &quot;Dream&quot; trilogy."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"DARING TO DREAM is the first book in the Dream trilogy. An interesting tale about Margo Sullivan who had visions of grandeur but wouldn't let her dreams die. She grew up in Monterey, California in a mansion. She was treated like a family member, but was actually the daughter of the housekeeper. Her mother tried to keep Margo's feet on the ground, but it didn't work. She went on to have a successful modeling career until scandal ruined it and caused her to go bankrupt, but she continued to dream. She retreats to her hometown and back into the friendship with Kate and Laura, her two childhood friends who grew up in the same house with her.Sound like a normal romance - it is up until the first few pages, then it has jumps and turns that are very unexpected. Margo ends up talking her buddies into a business venture that saves each of them from the ghosts that hound them.One thing that is interesting is that the running of the business is not glamorized and is shown as very hard work, but still enjoyable. This runs more along the real lines of actual life than fantasy, but has a dose of \\"real life\\" now and then for good measure.DARING TO DREAM is a very enjoyable book. The only trilogy that I liked better than this one was the Born In series!"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I love this book. From trilogy, this is my favorite. Ever since I bought it a couple of years ago, I've gone back to it again and again. I just can't get enough of it!While it's true that Margo seems a bit too spoiled and selfish at the beginning, you also come to understand her motivation for using her body--which is her only asset--to create a world for herself. Margo is not all bad. She's caring about her friends, and in her own way, she does things for them. She gives them support, and is there when they need her.I liked Josh from the beginning. He could easily have been a very snobbish, spoiled person, but he wasn't. He cared very much about his sister and nieces. The good relationship between him and his family was evident, and that clearly says something about him.Although we don't see much interaction between Margo and Josh, the reader does believe that there is a caring, loving relationship developing between them. Although Josh is a bit too possessive, it's reasonable since he's had to do without Margo for a very long time. Personally, I like them and think that they would be great people to know.If you like the DREAM series, you may also want to try the MacGregors, the BORN IN trilogy, the Stanislaskis, and the O'Hurleys."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Daring to Dream is the first story in the Dream Trilogy. It focuses on Margo Sullivan, the daughter of the Templeton's housekeeper. Margo's best friends are her two \\"sisters\\" whose stories are told in the other books. Margo is beautiful and has always had plans to see the world and be famous.Margo gets her wish, becoming a famous model in Europe, but a scandal involving her agent takes it all away. With nothing left, she returns home to Templeton House. Josh Templeton, the heir of the fortune, has had a crush on Margo since they were kids. He jokingly gives her the idea of opening a store, which of course, she takes seriously. With the help of her sisters, she finds a building near Fisherman's Wharf and opens Pretenses, a store that customers can purchase high-end second hand items. Margo sells a lot of her own things that are no longer needed to get things going.Josh and Margo go the usual route in a romance relationship, but I enjoyed reading it tremendously. Josh is not the spoiled heir, he's a lawyer for the Templeton Hotel chain, and actually goes to work. He sees a new side of Margo when she starts her store, which draws him to her even more.Intertwined in this story is the one of Seraphina, a young girl who killed herself when the love of her life died. She left behind a treasure buried somewhere in the cliffs by Templeton House, and the girls hope to someday find it.This is also a great story of the love and friendship between Margo, Kate and Laura. They have completely different personalities, but together, they make a great team. They are there for each other no matter what, no questions asked. We should all be that lucky in our lives.This was a great start to the series. I recommend it to anyone. If you've read Nora Roberts before, you know you won't be disappointed. If you've never read one of her books, this is a great one to start with."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Model, Margo Sullivan, is trying to patch her life back together after her career is shattered by a dirty scandal. She heads back home to heal her wounds and to help out an old friend going through an emotionally trying time and falls in love with the friend's brother, an old childhood crush, Josh now a rich playboy and sometimes Attorney.This is the first book by Nora Roberts that I could easily put down. Her beautiful knack for description was there as was her easily readable style but I didn't like the two lead. Margo, the gorgeous model heroine, was whiny and spoiled and used her looks to get whatever she wanted out of life. She did grow up a little bit towards the end and realized that the world didn't revolve around her but I still didn't like her much. The hero was just plain spoiled and wasn't present for a huge part of the book so I never grew to care for him. I found Daring To Dream to be more effective as a story about a woman's struggle to rebuild her life after devastation, and her attempts to reestablish caring and loving relationships with her childhood friends.Although I didn't click with either main character in this story, and wasn't excited by the romance, Nora Roberts kept me entertained with the strong interaction between the friends. Their love, devotion and banter came through as very believable and I am looking forward to the two sequels about Margo's friends' Laura and Kate. They appear to be sensible and compassionate (and less self-centered) women."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I finished the entire Dreams trilogy in less than a week. Her books never fail to engage and keep my attention. When I finish one of her books I often find myself missing the characters I have just spent so much time reading about. The characters of the Templeton family were no exception. I think Kate's story was my favorite as it was the most realistic of the three. But I loved them all. I would love to see more books in the future - perhaps written in a similar fashion to the McGregor family series of books. I would like to see books written about Ali, Kayla, and JT's journeys into adulthood. Keep writing Nora - I'll always be a great fan."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Nora Roberts is a great story teller, she knows how to keep you interested in her books. This triology makes you want to buy all the books. Its a great tale of three friends that were all from totally different families and who became the best of friends who were there whenever they were in trouble. No matter what family crisis arose, they could always count on each other. You show them as they were growing up and all the problems that each encountered. It was nice seeing them search for a hidden treasure all their lives and finally find it when they least expected it. It was a great finish to the books.

I wonder how authors like this can write one great book after another. I just finished reading the Quinn Brothers trilogy and thought that it was a marvellous set of books. Until I started reading the Dream trilogy which is impossibly just as good if not better.Margo, Kate and Laura are three best friends brought up in the Templeton household. In Daring to Dream, the author focuses on Margo, the daughter of the housekeeper in the household. Margo dreams to be rich and famous and she made it...until a scandal forces her back home. There, she has to set her life straight once again and she does that by setting up a shop with her best friends to help get herself out of debt.Along the way, she manages to fall in love with Josh Templeton, Laura's brother and heir apparent. Josh has loved Margo forever and has waited for her to be ready to settle down and come home. Their love is hot and steamy, but yet so extremely sweet and tender. It's not often that authors show heroes wearing their hearts on their sleeves from the very beginning but Nora Roberts does that and so successfully as well.I started reading this book at midnight on a work night and did not finish until three in the morning. Instead of going to sleep, I started on the second book instead and had to force myself to stop after an hour because I would not have gotten any sleep otherwise. This trilogy is so good and I'm halfway through the second book which is so far just as exciting, though I still prefer Margo's story.Read this trilogy - it's got everything.

I have also read a couple of other books by this author and have really enjoyed them.What I did like: I liked the theme behind this book. Once again we have a series of book by Nora the centers around the close friendship of three friends and we one friend that is the main character in this story, which I enjoy.What I didn't like: I did not like the way that the main character Margo was such a \\"flighty\\" person. It seemed like no matter what Josh or anyone would do for her should would push away the chance to be happy. This book seemed to have a kind of depressing feel to it at times because of Margo always looking for more.Overall Impression: I enjoyed this book as was hoping for a happy ending but at times I was wondering if this would happen. I liked how Josh was always trying to make things better for Margo. It seems Margo wanted to leave a life that would have been \\"normal\\" and good for her to replace something she was missing. She was always missing having a dad and due to this she was making reckless decisions which ended putting her in a bad situation. In the background we learn a little about her friends who are considered her sisters and some of their problems.

She probably encapsulates everything most women dislike about gorgeous model types, however as I stayed with the story, I found that Margo did get into my heart. Yes, she's brash, cocky and totally beautiful but when you get past her facade, to me she is a woman that I would be proud to call a friend.I loved her spats with Josh and her vulnerability at times got to to me. Her desire to be someone, to be a success because she thinks it's the only way the people around her will really think anything of her reminds me of a lot of people and I enjoyed the ride I took with Margo.

The story is about three sisters, and what they go through in their lifetime in high society. I really enjoyed all three books in this series.

I'll even read a Harlequin (or Silhouette) if her name is on it. This one is fun to read, however, being from the Monterey Bay area, the only criticism is she should have done her research....a house by the sea in Big Sur goes for millions, not a paltry $300K.

I read it twice and I read the rest of the series just so I could see what happened to Margo and Josh. These two characters were made for each other, their temperaments are very much a like and yet different enough to fit together like two peices of a puzzel. I can still laugh just thinking about some of the scenes in the novel. Another great Robert's novel is Honest Illusions. Both books are beautifully written with eccentric characters that will make you feel love at times and hate at others. Please e-mail me if you liked this book and I will give you other suggestions.

It draws you in from the first moment. Though, the plot has its ups and downs, there are shallow moments, there are moments that drag so slowly, and then there are too fast paced events, and then you also question the almost- friends- sibling- love relationship that Margo and Josh have. All of these give you some doubts and drawbacks, which unfortunately take away something from the appeal of the story. Nevertheless, Nora Roberts succeeds, as usual, to steal you away into a journey that you want to see where it takes you, and you can't help but enjoy that..."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Yet another wonderful story from the queen of romance.....I can never put your books down, I buy and resale books as a side business BUT none of my Nora's are for Sale......Oh...... and the JD ROBB series really NEEDS to be a TV mini series or a even a new weekly drama...

Love and loyatly will always stand the test of time. Margo makes you want to root for her to survive."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Nora Roberts is deservedly famous for her trilogies and longer series, usually embracing families or friends. But there's a problem with writing so many series - after a while, she becomes derivative of her own work. There are always three heroines, so one is blond, one brunette, one either raven-haired or redheaded. One will be tall, one petite, one of medium height. One will be lush, one lanky...it's almost as if she tosses a pair of dice to see how to combine the characteristics. In \\"Daring to Dream\\", the heroine has nothing going for her except staggering beauty and loyalty to her friends. She's shallow, selfish, greedy and thoughtless. She leaves home with hardly a word at age 18 and miraculously finds fame and fortune, which is pulled from under her feet years later, causing her to return home and rethink her life strategy. She's had numerous affairs with married men, making her even more obnoxious in my eyes. I can't tell why the hero falls for her, since she has so little to offer. The plot device of three friends opening a shop together was done to much better effect in her Key trilogy. The hero is fairly generic: powerful, wealthy, handsome. This book is not a keeper; in fact, it's hardly worth reading. For quality heroines, I'd recommend the Chesapeake Bay quartet, the Mackade Brothers trilogy, or the Three Sisters Island trilogy instead."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I LOVE Nora Roberts. Anything by her is great. Having said that, this trilogy is one of the better ones by her, I think.Each book can stand alone and this one about Margo does just that. This book is about starting over, taking the bad and turning it into something wonderful. This book reminds readers that money is not everything important and that there are other more important parts of life: family, love, friendsip, respect, and a positive attitude are some of thesee.If you like reading a book about families, sisters and friends, this is a great book to read. If you enjoy reading books about how one strong woman can turn around a bad situation into something positive, this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts trilogies. And Daring to Dream is a wonderful beginning.Margo Sullivan, a supermodel, finds herself involved in a career damaging scandal that leaves her with virtually nothing left but her family, and home is were she runs...Josh Templeton, heir to one of the largest hotel chains in the world, has been in love with Margo for as long as he can remember. And he sees this as the perfect opportunity to step back into her life...Nora Roberts has created a story full of hope, romance, practicality and magic. One of her best."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"This book was a total disappointment.

I thought this was one of the best books of hers that I've read - and I've read a LOT of them! (I'm also a big J.D. Robb fan). The three women who are the main characters are so different from each other but also very close to one another. The matriarch of the family is the exact right combination of strength and softness and the soft-hearted (but don't tell her we know) housekeeper adds a good balance to the household. It was hard to watch the way she and her daughter never seemed to understand one another but oh so lovely when they finally worked it all out. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"This book is really well written and is an easy read.

I went to her bookstore a few years ago, while on vacation. Lucky for me, she was doing a signing of her new book, that day. But no, I had to have a brand new hardcover of this trilogy signed. This was one of my first books on my kindle. Love with a twist of fun, really makes it for me. The dialogue between Josh and Margo and the relationship of the heroines of this trilogy has such a uniqueness that makes this book, my favorite go to book; for a plane ride of lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"After reading a few chapters in this book, I found out that I did not really like Margo as a person. This book also reminded me of the movie &quot;Sabrina&quot;. Margo was not very appreciative of what she had, and did not treat her mum very well, (of course her mum did not treat Margo very well either) She straightens out her life after her glamorous world she created for herself in Europe came crashing down, and she found out that family loyality was the best gift. Her dream ended up helping her and her two sisters grow. This is a good book, but number 2 is the best, and number 3 the second best of the triology."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I have not been a reader of Nora Roberts for very long. I work the grave shift, and as most other women have a house and family to look after. I normally read romance novels with short stories, so that I can get my daily dose of romance and not have to spend alot of time doing it. I must say though that after my first Nora Roberts novel I was hooked line and sinker. I have read all three of the novels in this series along with the Born in series, I liked this series the best. With Daring to Dream, I also could not put it down even though my family insisted at dinner time. I laughed, cried, and laughed again. I really enjoyed the sister relationship of the three women, and felt that this is how it should be between sisters blood or otherwise. I also wished there was a fourth in the series. I would have loved to have meet the character Ms. Roberts would have found for Margo's mother. I would definately recommend this series to anyone, and I am very greatful to my cowo! ! rker for her reviews. I say keep it Ms Roberts you are doing an excellent job.

I loved this book and am ready to start on her next!"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I'm not familiar with the Romance genre. I thought I'd try something new, recognized Roberts' name from the bestseller lists, and bought this thing. Mistake. I only got to page 256, so read my review with that in mind.This book features: poor writing (unsignalled point of view shifts happen multiple times), shallow and unlikeable characters with little or no actual emotional attachment to one another, and a control freak hero who constantly demeans and belittles the heroine. During arguments he also grabs her, slings her around like a caveman, topples her into a full bathtub and holds her head under the water.But its not violence because he looooves her? It's okay because it just shows how passionate and out of control he is over her? Or maybe its okay because he's being playful. As long as he doesn't *intend* to hurt her that makes it all right, right? Seriously, I cannot imagine in what world anyone would find this behavior romantic. It certainly isn't legal.Anyway, I threw the book in the trash."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again! I enjoyed this story so much.

Nora Roberts just makes you feel as though you know the characters so well. It is a wonderful 3 part story of 3 sisters of the heart. It takes you through each of their lives and their evolution into the women they are today. This first book is focused on Margo, a maid's daughter. She has huge dreams and sets out to find them and make them come true. Read this book to see her set out, find and lose her self and then come full circle back to the place she started out."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Daring to Dream is the first book in this must read series.

Nora what happened. None of the main characters in these 3 books were sympathetic. Between whining and complaining and dumping on the men these women deserved to stay single. Please Nora don't write books like these anymore."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars rather than one is the HILARIOUS scene where Peter and Josh play tennis. Otherwise... yuck!! First of all, I found it very unrealistic that Margo would simply be able to channel all of her love for modeling into love for her store. You aren't forced out of a high-profile career like that without a LOT of emotional fallout. Second of all, Josh treated her like dirt! Always being the one with the control, making snide little comments about how she brought it on herself. I wonder how well HE would have done without the Templeton family name and fortune behind him. Margo may have been whiny, but she built her career from the ground from scratch and had a lot more inner strength than I saw from Josh. Not that I liked either one all that much."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I read this book in 6 hours. I couldn't put it down! It starts out with this sad moment in a woman named seraphina's life when she kills herself. Then the author takes you a century later to see3 10-year-old girls fantasizing about it! it sets up the trilogy very well.then you focus on margo and you really sympathize with her over all her trouble. If you buy this you won't be able to put it down. I dare you!"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I really like the Characters in this book 3 girls raised as sisters Laura- Rich Girl parents own several hotels around the world. Katie- Parents Died and is a cousin of Laura's parents take her in after her parents traggic death. Then there is Margo- the daughter of the house keeper her father died in a boating accident lost at sea when she was 4 and they moved to America from Ireland. Laura, Katie, and Margo were raised as sisters and were best friends and they each have their own struggles and dreams. Laura marries young in life to a man whom both of her friends and her brother Josh dislike. Katie goes to Harvard After she graduates a year early. And Margo's mom is pressuring her to go to Harvard with Katie but instead runs off to hollywood and Europe to become a model against her moms and Josh's wishes.

This is a great book I read it in 24 hours."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I am going to read the whole dream trilogy just so I can find out what happens to Josh and Margo. I thought that &quot; Daring to Dream&quot; was an excellent book, but the ending was slightly unrealistic. Why would Josh forgive her when she was kissing another man? Overall, the book was good, though."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I thought that the plot and storyline was good and worth reading. I liked how Margo turned a bad situation into a life learning experience. This is the same reason why I like some classics that I have read where they make the most of the hard times and grow from their trials. The one thing that I despised about this book was all the foul language including a lot of the \\"f\\" word, taking Jesus Christ's name in vain and others. Some mild language is tolerable in my opinion, but all the severely foul language was not necessary to make a good story or book. In fact it took away from the quality of the book just to say those foul words. There are miriad of \\"classic\\" literature through the ages that NEVER put in one swear word and they are never to be forgotten stories that changeS a person who reads them. THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS GOOD WTHOUT ANY OF THE POTTY MOUTH WORDS IN IT. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO EXPRESS ONESELF WITHOUT ALL THE FILTH. My respect for this author has diminished greatly and I will not read another book by her unless I ever find that she has some cleaner novels. Even the many more modern romance books I have read have not put this kind of offensive language in them."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I have to agree with another review that didn't like the heroine.

I got lost in the books so much that when they were over I felt like I knew each character peronally!"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I loved this book and am so impressed with it as an entree to a trilogy. It all leads up to chemistry of the two romantic leads and they absolutely have this in spades, as well as the chemistry and deep friendship between three women. Dreamer, Margo Sullivan, moves as a young girl with her mother from Ireland when her mother takes a housekeeping job with a wealthy, Hotel Chain owning, Templeton family. Margo is essentially welcomed as a member of the family and sister to young Laura and Josh Templeton, as well as an orphaned cousin Kate who also grows up with them in the lap of luxury. Although Margo has always been treated as an equal, she's always aware that the dream is not hers and she grows up with goals that one day she'll have what the Templetons have. To help her obtain that dream, headstrong Margo grows into a stunning young woman and when she turns eighteen, she decides to move to LA to try her hand as a model. She ends up becoming fairly successful in the European market and during a vacation with one of her lovers, she ends up arrested, discovering that said lover is married and a criminal. Due to her lavish lifestyle and her lack of attention to where her money has been syphoned, Margo hits rock bottom and has to figure out what to do next.Hotel attorney and owner, Josh Templeton, practically Margo's brother with absolutely no blood relation, doesn't know when it happened, but growing up with Margo, he can't help but admit that he's hopelessly in love with her. Josh has watched Margo traipse around the world with her lovers and modeling gigs for 10 years while he secretly watches and waits for his opportunity to sweep her off her feet. He's been an integral part of her life, but he's never found the right time to introduce the concept of anything outside of their platonic relationship.As Margo is trying to straighten out her life, she ends up rushing home to California to help support Laura Templeton through an ugly divorce and she leans on her two best friends Kate, an accountant, and Laura, a mother and heiress, for support of her own. With no liquid assets and rooms full of luxury stuff she's accumluated over the past ten years, Margo, Laura and Kate, with a little push from Josh, decide to go into the consignment business to sell her things. This provides a career opportunity for Margo, a distraction for Laura, and an investment for Kate.Throughout the trials and tribulations of starting a new business, Josh is there every step of the way to provide encouragement as well as a reality check for some of Margo's wild ideas but it's the perfect opportunity for them to get together. The sparks absolutely fly between the two and the \\"girl time\\" between Margo, Kate and Laura is absolutely precious. This is truly a wonderful story of love and friendship without the misunderstandings and catty backstabbing that can come along with very human emotions. You can connect with Margo's envy of everyone around her, yet it doesn't turn into ugly jealousy and her growth from spoiled princess to, well, spoiled mature woman, is totally believable. It was a great journey and when I find myself needing a little pick me up, I can always turn back to rereading Daring to Dream. The best part is, there's two additional books, Kate and Laura's stories, to follow this one that provide a peak into this happily ever after."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"Nora Roberts is just one of the finest writers in history. Her writing, character development, plot, structure, archetypal Everything moves the story forward flawlessly. There is NO wasted motion and NO wasted space, or words with Nora.

I have never read nora roberts but this book will keep me coming back for more. It is very seductive and has alot of very sensual scenes in the book. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"&quot;Daring to Dream&quot; is the first book in the &quot;Dream&quot; trilogy and it is an exceptional piece of writing. The story is compelling and well written. The friendship of these three &quot;sisters of the heart&quot; is touching and the romance is exciting and fulfilling.Margo Sullivan has lived in a house of wealth and privilege all her life, but she has always been one step back from it, being the housekeeper's daughter. She has lived with Laura Templeton, the daughter of the wealthy and powerful Templetons and Kate, Laura's orphaned cousin nearly all of her life. Margo manages to make a name for herself, using her stunning good looks, in the modeling world, but she returns home after a scandal destroys her career.Many reviewers have criticized Margo for being a selfish and unlikeable character. I have to disagree. Although she does have quite an ego, she is also an excellent and loyal friend who would do ANYTHING for Laura and Kate. This book is about Margo's growth as a person and her self-discovery. A character without flaws is just plain unrealistic, and Margo's faults only make her seem more human.The romance that blooms between Margo and Laura's brother Josh is truly lovely. Margo and Josh have been in love with each other for the better part of both of their lives, although neither of them was aware of the others feelings. The tale of these two finally finding each other was quite captivating.Despite Josh's riches and trust funds, he is a generous, hard-working man and a very likeable hero. Margo and Josh are really great together and the reader is treated to some wonderfully sexy scenes.This book starts an absolutely fabulous trilogy, and it is most definitely worth reading. So don't listen to the negative reviews, just enjoy these characters for who they are and join them on their journey to find true love!"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"This book is great Margo and her best friends plus the gorgeous Josh Templeton make a dynamyte team you really live what's hapening in the book you feel it and it's great"},{"Title":"Daring to Dream (Dream Series)","review":"I usually only read Historical Romances, but when I read Daring to Dream by Nora Roberts, I was so impressed.

The history of tulip itself is intresting; Central Asia high land origin, Ottoman Empire palace, Clusius and Rudolf the second. Furthermore the author's analysis of why tulip bulbes dealt by such a high price is persuasive; the forerunner of futre market. This book is worth reading, not only by intellectuals but also by business people."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"This was an odd book. When I had first read the description I had pictured one of those larger books that went into the history of the tulip and probably many detailed drawings or photographs of different varieties. That is not what this book is about.This book covers the history of the great Tulipomania in which the Dutch people paid exorbitant prices for certain varieties of tulips due to a mania of wanting to possess the most rare and beautiful bulbs. For a modern day reference think Beanie Babies. At least I was reminded of that craze while reading this book.It starts with the Tulips origination on the border of Russian and China, and its slow movement westward towards Europe. Also included in this beginning of the novel is its possession and use by the Turkish people who would eventually trade it west. It detailed their magnificent garden and their use of flowers as wild abandon, and not straight cultivated rows.Once it hit Europe it experienced a short craze in France and then moved northward to the Dutch people. Here the genetics of the flowers were played with and new varieties formed. Dash gives the names of the varieties and the colors, but this can become quite confusing at times as he expects you to remember what the varieties are later in the book. Something that to me was impossible to do.He also introduces throughout the book some historical figures that helped launched the Tulip's success. One of these such people was Carolus Clusius. Clusius was an avid lover of Tulips and spent much time cultivating different varieties. He was hired on to design gardens for many noble people and his study was actually as a Doctor, but only so he could study Botany which at the time was only offered to doctors. While there were other important figures, the most time was spent on Clusius while the others remained people with impressive collections or certain traders who sold individual bulbs at astronomical prices.The book details the height of the craze and then its crash, compared to the stock market crash we are familiar with. It explains what happened to the debts and merchants who dabbled in the trade. Then it returns us back to the Turkish people, who form their own mini-tulip craze before it seems to die out completely. Dash also at this point elaborates on a few minor Flower crazes that could seem like Tulipomania.There were a few things that I didn't particularly like with this book. It read much like a reference and w hile that's not always a bad thing, it made it slow reading in this case. Dash also seems to repeat himself and a few times I felt myself looking at the page number as I had experienced deja vu when reading a particular paragraph. Turns out the same thing was being said, the items were just in different order. He also spends a lot of time on the money system of Guilders. While some reference is needed to understand the reading, he kept repeating and doing the figuring for you.One redeeming quality of his writing style however, is that he put the small notes at the bottom of the page instead of back in the notes section. This makes it an easier read as you are not constantly flipping back and forth for clarification.While it was an intriguing book its not one that I'd buy for anyone or probably read again unless needing to do a report on the happenings of the Tulip.TulipomaniaCopyright 1999220 Pages, plus more for notes and bibliography"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Tulipomania has been on the market for a few years, and I heard of it quite awhile back and finally got around to reading it. Anyone who loves tulips (and does not know why) needs to read this fascinating book.While living in Amsterdam (1999-2001) weekly I would buy a bunch of 50 tulips for $10 and split the bunch up with friends, I always had them in my apartment, and only now can I identify which ones I was buying. These same friends also shared with me that during WWII, the Dutch were forced to boil and eat tulip bulbs left in warehouses. That's post-modern history of tulips...their origins in the foothills of the Himalayas was a surprise, as was the biological explanation that it is a virus that causes certain tulips to \\"break\\" and change colors from one season to the next. These are the flower bulbs that were worth more than their weight in gold, and fortunes were exchanged over possessing the rarest of the rare.The history of the Dutch is also wrapped up in this very well-researched and written book. Their \\"economic mindedness\\" from the the butcher to the banker explains how many everyday people got caught up in \\"Tulipomania\\" by buying and selling shares in rare bulbs. As a tulip bulb usually grows larger during the season, it weighs more when dug up in the fall. The Dutch wagered the weight would be higher, and when sold, the extra weight was their profit.All mania ends in sadness, and when the market for bulbs collapsed, many were left bankrupt, and tulipmania became, once again, only a rich man's game."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I just finished reading this wonderful book. Dash is a master story teller whose light tone and style make history come alive. The topic of economic bubbles is still very relevant today and this book describes how one of the very first documented bubbles started, peaked and abruptly burst.The book covers the history of the Tulip - from its origins in Eastern Asia, through its journeys to the court of the Turkish Sultan and its brief popularity with the French elite. The focus then shifts to the main and most exciting subject of the book - the Tulipomania that gripped the Dutch provinces in the closing months of 1636 and the early months of 1637.The author opens for the reader a window into the 17th century Dutch provinces. In addition to the discussion about the rise and fall of the Tulip as a valuable commodity the book also provides the reader with an understanding of the day to day life of local citizens, contemporary culture and political climate.My only (minor) complaint about the book is that while the author tries to provide specific, documented examples of the Tulipomania, he sometimes gets bogged down in tiresome detail and at other times draws conclusions from what appears to be insufficient information.Overall, this is a wonderful book that both enlightens and entertains. I would recommend this book to any reader interested in history, economics or human nature in general. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"This book arrived quickly and was in great shape.I thoroughly enjoyed the history of Tulipmania in the early 1600s of the Netherlands. It is amaxing when we realize that there were many more burst bubbles long before the recent dotcom bubble of 2000. Who would have thought that people would have gone to such lengths to obtain a tulip bulb. During this era, the right bulb could be traded for a person's estate. What amazing history. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone intreested in history in general, or to the individual fascinated by our more recent business booms."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Anybody who has read anything about \\"bubbles\\" in economic theory has probably come across the 17th century Dutch example of Tulipomania. However, most of what is written about this frenzy for tulips has come from a single English-language source written in the 19th century. Mike Dash has gone back to Dutch sources for this account of this remarkable episode of Dutch history when in an act seemingly out of character for the Netherlands some parts of the country simply went mad for profit in tulips of all things.This book deals with the introduction of tulips to Holland and the growth and methods of trading tulips along with what normally happened on the Dutch stock market at the time as a comparison. This is important because the methods of trading tulips and the introduction of futures trading in tulips are one of the main reasons that the craze grew so quickly.Fortunately, this book also deals with the aftermath of the craze, so you get to see how the Dutch government of the time dealt with mass outstanding debts that had no hope of being paid and it also touches upon other botanical crazes that happened in other countries in the following centuries. If you are interested in this earliest of economic bubbles and some of the extremes of human behaviour that can occur when crowds of people think there's an easy profit to be had then I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting read."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"In 1562, most of the first tulip bulbs ever to enter Holland were mistaken for a type of onion and were promptly roasted and eaten. The few that were actually planted in the ground popped up the following spring, to the utter astonishment of Dutchmen (and -women). But it took almost another century for the flowers to drive them crazy.Why would pious, hard-working Calvinist merchants spend fortunes (few won, most lost) on a flower? The story of Holland's infatuation with tulips in the 1630s is as much a story of the temperate Dutch merchants' uncomfortableness with their own wealth. (The Catholics--they could flaunt their money. Calvinists--they had to repress it.)The Dutch East India Company was founded in 1602. After a few decades of Dutch ships plying distant seas and returning home laden with exotic goods, the merchants with a stake in the game became staggeringly wealthy. Yet even with their newfound wealth, they were still Calvinists: severe and restrained. They didn't decorate themselves (like those Catholics), so they decorated their surroundings. And what to buy with all that wealth? How about a commissioned portrait of wife and kids (looking severe and restrained)? Check. Nice house? Check. Manicured garden behind house? Check. And to fill that garden?An exotic flower, first introduced from the Orient, became the object of a national obsession. Entire markets were created just to trade tulips, and the markets were soon swamped with speculators. It was the first-ever futures market. At the height of the tulip-mania, in 1636 and 1637, single bulbs could be sold for 3,000 guilders: enough to buy you one ship, eight pigs, four oxen, sundry other animals, a year's worth of food (good food, mind you), a set of clothes, some furniture and some nice silver cutlery to boot.So why the tulip? Perhaps it was the Calvinist equivalent of the five-carat diamond ring: an acceptable treasure, neither flashy nor ostentatious, but delicate and natural, created by God. (And perhaps the fact that it bloomed only a few weeks every year meant the neighbors couldn't accuse you of constantly showing off your wealth--another sign of God's own temperance.)The story of any 'mania' offers insight into the aspirations and anxieties of the culture it affects. And even though Mike Dash's 'Tulipomania' focuses primarily on the short-lived craze for a single flower, it opens a window on the social economics of the Dutch \\"Golden Age\\": how Holland's merchant class struggled with its strict faith, its new-found wealth, and its place at the center of a burgeoning world power."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I read this book years ago - and it's still with me.

I, being a bit naive, was intrigued that the author, Dr. Mike Dash, would write a book suggesting the Tulip was center to such passion, greed and, to this day-world history. Shallow thinker that I am, I presumed the coveted Rose would be more relevant. I bought the book. I read the book. I lent the book to a friend, who read the book. And while I forgive them their shared enthusiasm, they still have not returned my book! What to do, but get another copy. I also bought two additional copies, for lending purposes. I re-read the book, too. More than a handful who have received 'Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused' from me, have had the same experience. \\"Who knew?\\" One of my more learned friends called to comment, \\"A Tulip! I'll never see them as ordinary, ever again.\\" He said to me.Indeed."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"A story of the speculation in tulips that became a near hysteria in the United Provinces in 1636-1637. This is an in-depth section through a particular period in Dutch history that includes most aspects of economic life, the wealthy and the poor. The book is thus a notable work of social history that I found to be extremely entertaining and informative. I took off one star because a few color plates, or even a good cover plate, showing some of the tulips in question would have been nice, especially because the more desirable tulips of that time may no longer exist. (Maybe there are some pictures in the hard cover edition). Also, as a scientist, I would have been interested in more details about the 'mosaic virus' that infected the 'superbly fine' tulips and caused their unique colorations. These quibbles aside, I would strongly recommend this interesting book to anyone."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"As a history buff, there is nothing more exciting than finding a well-written book on an aspect of history that I know nothing about. This book on the tulip wars or mania of the Netherlands is written with wit, style and surprising depth for such a short work. I read Tulipomania after reading Longitude, which I found rather disappointing with its extremely narrow focus, and its inability to make Harrison come alive as a human being (although I understand the author was hampered by lack of primary sources). Tulipomania makes these 16th and 17th century people come alive and seem relevant to our day (I'm thinking about the stock market fascination with all the dotcoms of the Internet). I would give the book 5 stars, except for it would have really benefited by some drawings of those wonderous flowers."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Mike Dash's Tulipomania is not quite a book for the pocket, although it would fit well enough into a roomy, gusseted, waxed-jacket one. But why stow it in a pocket when, so nicely hand-sized, it invites you to read it in bed, or curl up by the fire with it? You might as well make yourself comfortable at the outset, because you will not want to put it down. The is tulip-mania-as-ripping-yarn. I can't remember the last time I read a plant book or gardening book that was such a page turner. On the evidence, Mike Dash could probably make train-spotting into a riveting read. Give him the tulip craze and there's no holding him. From the opening lines of the preface (and who among us ALWAYS reads the introduction? On no account miss this one), you are caught up and magicked away -to the beery taverns of Haarlem, the Celestial Mountains (the Tien Shan, the backbone of Asia), and the 'Abode of Bliss', the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. When considered coldly, analytically, the amount of history you are being fed is, like the cast of characters, prodigious; but such is the artistry of the writing that you will simply mop it all up, sponge-like, and absorb it, as you pursue the twists and turns of the story. And you don't HAVE to read the Notes, but you will probably enjoy them almost as much, for they are everything that Notes should be. Comparing this book to Anna Pavord's equally acclaimed The Tulip is rather like trying to decide whether you want cheese or a pudding at the end of dinner. Each has its own allure, and the greedy among us will probably opt for both. But let me tell you one thing: in this case, if you choose the pudding only, it will be at the expense of the BEST bit of cheese you'll encounter for a long time. Connoisseurs please take note."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Whether you are a history or a plant buff, the history of the tulip is unquestionably a fascinating topic. If you are both a history and plant buff, like me, this topic is absolutely intoxicating. So deep and thought provoking are the moral and philosophical questions surrounding the tulip craze, it would seem nearly impossible to write a boring book on the subject. Nevertheless, I have read, or attempted to read, some books on this fascinating period of history that have nearly put me to sleep. Tulipomania by Mike Dash captures the essence of what makes the history of this plant so irresistible. Unlike a history book, he doesn't get overly bogged down with dates and names. Unlike a horticulture or botany book, he presents some of the technical details of the plant without using technical terms the average reader wouldn't appreciate. Rather, Mike Dash tells a story, which just happens to be about a plant, that spans over several hundred years. He paints a colorful picture of personalities, historical towns and, palaces that reads like a novel. However, unlike many novels, this book leaves the reader with many thought provoking questions. The reader is left pondering human social behavior, values, and the prostitution of nature. While enjoyable, this is anything but an empty, pass the time, light reading book. This book should be mandatory reading for all high school students. Mike Dash relays this fascinating saga so clearly; virtually everyone who reads this book will be forever touched. Our society could learn so much from the history of this plant, yet most American schools never even mention this fabulous saga. I know I will make sure my children read this book when they are older."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I'm not particularly interested in the business/economic angle of Tulipomania (although it certainly calls up some interesting questions about today's stock market).

This is a must-read for any history buff or armchair historian!"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I loved this book and thought I'd add a review as I suspect that some of the other reviewers may be comparing it a littlke unfairly to the works of Mr Schama or Ms Pavord (both of which I liked). As the title suggests this is a book about the tulipomania which gripped Holland between 1634 and 1637 - not about the history of Holland as a whole in that period or indeed about the tulip itself - and it is so elegantly written that it properly supplies a distant mirror to a period which increasingly reflects the dot.bomb phenomenon going on here. All I can say is that this is a lovely, salutary book - a rare pleasure in my view - and Mr Dash is also to be commended for making the lives of the people in it so real that I almost felt I knew them. This is also not the sort of book I usually read so the pleasure I found in it was unexpected. Great start to my New Year, anyway. Thank you Mr Dash!"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Well, although I am American, my mother liked to remind me that four of my great-grandparents sailed from the Netherlands in the 1870s--two from Groningen and two from Zealand. I am happy to see the tulip craze did not begin in either of those places. I can understand the craze for tulips however. Yesterday, I bought $200 worth of tulip bulbs--never mind whether I have the discretionary funds for this mania.&quot;Tulipomania&quot; is an interesting little book on the order of the recently released tale about William Bligh's 4,000 mile sea journey after he involuntarily disembarked the Bounty (&quot;Portable Nightmare&quot; by John Toohey). &quot;Tulipomania&quot; is just as narrowly focused. It excerpts the story of the frenzied tulip buying, selling and subsequent financial crash in the 17th Century Netherlands from a larger context covered extensively in the &quot;Embarrassment of Riches&quot; by Simom Schama. Can one really understand the Dutch and their tulips from this little book? Well, if you're just getting started reading Dutch history this is a good place to begin, but for heaven's sake don't make it your last book on the subject.&quot;Tulipomania&quot; really isn't for those gardners or botonists who want to know more about tulips. Anna Pavord's lavishly illustrated &quot;Tulip&quot; is much more useful for learning about the almost infinite varieties of this plant. &quot;Tulipomania&quot; should appeal more to readers with an interest in political-economics and the dynamics of group mania buying by the public (bought any &quot;beanie babies&quot; lately?).I learned a few things from &quot;Tulipomania&quot; or maybe I had read them elsewhere and remembered them when I read this book. For example, I did not recall that tulip mania was concentrated among a small group of relatively poor people, and that it had little impact on the Dutch economy. Also, I was reminded the government tried to deal with the problems following the drop in tulip prices.Their are many anecdotal bits in this book including the story of the orphans of one Wouter Winkle. These children lost both parents and all they had left in the world were the tulip bulbs their unfortunate father left them. How the market saved them is heart-rending.Dash uses much secondary material and he cites Schma, Pavord, Israel, Norwhich, and other bona fide historians who have dealt with various aspects of the Dutch, their tulips and how the Ottoman Turks blew the chance to be the tulip kings of the world. The Ottoman rulers rivaled the old Roman Emperors for nastiness -- Caligula to name one. They were too busy being despicable to women and white Christian slaves to get serious about their tulip bulbs. When a Turk minister finally took a keen interest in breeding tulip bulbs that could have helped Turkey corner the market, his ruler had him killed."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"As someone who has seen each of his shares in glorious Nortel plunge to penny stock levels in less than two years, I was hoping that there would not be too many parallels between the famous Dutch tulip craze of the 17th Century and today's deflated high-tech market to depress me even more. Mike Dash's \\"Tulipomania\\" is a fascinating, well-researched and most enjoyable account of a strange episode that must still embarrass the hard-working citizens of the Netherlands.The author traces the movement of this exotic but hardy plant from the Ottoman Empire to the heart of Europe. He covers not only the natural history and characteristics of the plant, but also the weird habits of its fanciers. For example, the Ottoman sultans delighted in gorgeous gardens as much as in cruelty. They employed their palace gardeners both to spruce the place up and as executioners. Senior officials condemned to death had the opportunity to have their sentences commuted to banishment if they could outrun the head gardener to the southern end of the Topkapi Palace grounds. The Dutch, on the other hand, at first appear as sobersided, dully-dressed folk when, it turns out, during the Golden Age they were obsessive gamblers and enthusiastic drunkards.From a tight circle of botanists and connoisseurs, the interest in tulips exploded as it became apparent that money could be made. Big money. A class of traders arose that first dealt in plants and bulbs and then, over time, into trading the rights to bulbs they did not own. This early form of futures trading was disparaged as \\"Windhandel,\\" as ephemeral as the wind.The prices brought by bulbs when the mania was at its height can barely be imagined. A flower worth 3,000 guilders in December 1636 would have bought 8 pigs, 4 oxen, 12 sheep, 24 tons of wheat, 48 tons of rye, 2 hogsheads of wine, 4 barrels of beer, 2 tons of butter, a thousand pounds of cheese, a silver cup a pack of clothes, a bed with mattress, and a ship. Probably a small ship. The highest authenticated price for a bulb was 5,200 guilders.Of course, it was not to last. Within two months, prices had collapsed, everyone looked foolish and the lawsuits began. This sounds familiar. There were a few subsequent outbursts of flower mania but nothing to match the Dutch excesses. But in the same way the collapse in the prices of Barbie dolls or Beanie Babies or breeding lamas did not have much of an impact on the American economy, so too was tulipomania limited in its impact.This short book is equal parts entertainment and education. Mike Dash has combed original sources diligently and even the notes are worth browsing. You will probably never think about tulips (let alone Nortel shares) in the same way again."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Wow.

The author writes pretty well but there are only so many descriptions of tulips you can read without wanting to see the real thing."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I bought this book a few months ago, after reading the six-page paeon to it that appeared in Harper's, and it has been a revelation to me. It must be about 25 years now since I first heard of the tulip mania, and it struck me then as one of the most amazing historical stories I had heard. At that time I tried to find out as much as I could about it, and scoured libraries here and in Europe whenever I got the chance. Then I visited Holland and took the opportunity to look for information there. And the astonishing thing was, there wasn't any, at least for those who don't read Dutch. Charles Mackay's journalistic essay, written 150 years ago, was practically the only source in English. In fact, even the Dutch had only one book and a few ancient articles.All credit, then, to Dr Dash, who has done an impressively thorough job of research in compiling everything that is known about some of the most remarkable events in modern history. The author has gone to Dutch archives, read the Dutch texts, and exhumed more English language sources than I believed could possibly exist - his bibliography runs to nearly 200 items - making this a genuinely authoritative study. But he has also managed to tell his story concisely and well. Tulipomania is not a particularly long book (274 pages), but it covers a huge amount of ground. The story begins in the mountains of Tien Shan (on China's border with central Asia) and moves from there to the Ottoman Empire, India, Vienna and finally the Netherlands. By giving his book such a broad focus, Dash is able to put the Dutch tulip mania, which forms the central part of the book and covers about two thirds of its pages, into its proper context. The contrasts between Turkish sultans (rich men who loved the flower for its beauty) and Dutch tulip traders (poor men who loved it for its rarity, and hence monetary value) are particularly well done.Once the story moves to the Netherlands, we are introduced first to Carolus Clusius, the pioneer botanist who was largely responsible for spreading the flower widely throughout western Europe, and then to a succession of ever poorer tulip fanatics, starting with men such as Guillelmo Bartelotti (the second richest man in Holland) and ending with impoverished weavers by the names of Waermondt and Gaergodt. Dash's ability to exhume at least the basic details of these people's lives is particularly impressive, as the majority of them lived at the periphery of contemporary Dutch society and went unnoticed by contemporary chroniclers and record-keepers. The author goes on to explain the manner in which tulips affected all their lives and then to discuss the tulip mania itself, illustrating the amazing rise in prices (which often rose several hundred fold over the course of a year or two, and in some cases reached levels where single bulbs were more valuable than a house). Perhaps the most affecting section of the book is the central chapter titled 'The Orphans of Wouter Winckel', which tells how the seven orphaned children of an innkeeper from Alkmaar were saved from the workhouse by the sale of their dead father's hugely valuable collection of flower bulbs.Really I thought that this book had something for everyone. Those who are interested in business and stock markets will find its examination of an early market bubble very interesting. Those who like narrative non-fiction will find it a very engaging read (witty, too). Those who are gardeners will enjoy the botanical background the and the descriptions of some of the most ravishing flowers ever grown. Those who, lile me, have a sneaking love for the more colourful pages of the history books will particularly treasure the author's coverage of the Ottoman Turks, and relish his tales of imperial circumcision ceremonies and the opulance of life in the palace called The Abode of Bliss. In conclusion, I would recommend this book very highly to anybody with more than a passing interest in history, botany or economics."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"I like my history in bite-sized chunks; focused on one event but written broadly enough that it gives a decent feeling for the precedential value of the subject. Of course, we all know the relevance of the tulipmania, having lived through the internet boom--but it is particuarly fascinating to discover the parallels that teach, again, that history repeats itself.Is the lesson that market bubbles are the result of the destruction of barriers to entry? Do bubbles result when those who previously could not afford to enter the established futures/equity markets are suddenly granted the ability to profit from speculation? (One thinks immediately of the contemporary refinancing craze) Are there parallels to the Roaring Twenties, to the skyrocketing price of land at the present time? Most certainly. Are we too dumb to see it coming? Probably.I found that Mr. Dash strikes an excellent balance between telling the story and providing ancillary history, between depth and breadth. I'm no Doctor of Economics, but I felt that the work went into sufficient detail to allow parallels to be appropriately drawn from the event. And, it was a fun read. I'm going to plant tulips."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Tulips are one of my favorite flowers and wanted to learn more about the history of the flower.

It is interesting that the most coveted tulips were the &quot;diseased&quot; variety and one that we will never see in our lifetime. I think it would be interesting to see a &quot;Semper Augustus&quot; today.Dash tries to explain the reasons for the tulip mania in both Netherlands and Turkey and he succeeds with the little evidence he could muster.

The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house.Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair.This is the history of the tulip, from its origins on the barren, windswept steppes of central Asia to its place of honor in the lush imperial gardens of Constantinople, to its starring moment as the most coveted--and beautiful--commodity in Europe. Historian Mike Dash vividly narrates the story of this amazing flower and the colorful cast of characters--Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers--who were centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but who all had one thing in common: tulipomania"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"The Dutch Tulip Craze of 1636-37 is one of the most overworked stories in the world of business, yet historian and author Mike Dash presents a detailed description of Holland's economic conditions, and develops the plot in such an intriguing style the reader never gets bogged down in detail. The book is a page-turner. If you have an interest in tulips, history, or the futures market you will find this a remarkable read.Meticulous research is obvious as the author traces the bizarre history of the tulip. Dash starts in ancient Turkey where the blooms became an important symbol. The earliest known drawings of tulips are found on tiles excavated from a thirteenth-century palace in eastern Anatolia. Pious Muslims treated the flowers almost as holy relics and often wore blooms in their turbans and on their underwear. They said that when in full bloom, the tulip, called tulipan by the Turks, bows its head in modesty before God. When the Ottoman Turks took Constantinople and made it Istanbul, they built a myriad of gardens filled with tulips, the most beautiful next to the Hagia Sophia Mosque. Later, the sultan planted tulips in great profusion at his Topkapi palace within the Abode of Bliss beside the harbor known as the Golden Horn. The Hagia Sophia and Topkapi are still standing, but the tulips are gone.Dash says no one knows exactly how or where or when the flower first left Asia. A French botanist named Carolus Clusius actually sparked the Dutch mania by bringing his collection of the then-unknown bulbs with him when he accepted a post at Leiden in 1593.Dash uses anecdotal stories of the famous and common people whose lives become affected by the obsession for the delicate flower. There's the lowly tavern owner Wouter Winkel, whose death in 1633 left his seven children destitute --- until they dug up his bed of tulip bulbs and sold them at auction during the height of the tulip mania. The children, as wards of the court, lived in the public children's home. This auction transformed Winkel's heirs from penniless orphans to wealthy young men and women who would never have to work a day in their lives.This was the year that a wealthy buyer purchased a single bulb for the record breaking price of 5,200 guilders, more than the cost of a large house in the most fashionable neighborhood in Amsterdam. This precious flower created the first futures market in history and sparked the first boom and bust in economic history.Dash describes the colors and shapes of the most highly prized bulbs and explains the most desired flowers, referred to as \\"broken\\" colors, were actually infected with the mosaic virus. Dutch nurserymen hired artists to paint catalogs with page after page of watercolored Rosen, Violetten and Bizarden tulips. Potential bidders inspected the special tulip books.The book explains how tulips evolved from intense red flowers to the brightly colored and varied forms they reached under Dutch cultivation. \\"Somewhere in the center of this ruined town (Hoorn), in the first half of the seventeenth century, stood a house with three stone tulips carved into its facade.\\" Dash says there wasn't anything else outstanding about the house, but this is where the tulip mania began.\\"For three decades flower lovers had used money to buy tulips. Now --- for the first time --- tulips were being used as money.\\" Dash says that by the winter of 1636, the value of some bulbs could double in little more than a week. At first the buying and selling of bulbs occurred only when the tulips were out of the ground and could be physically exchanged, but gradually in spite of warnings from professional traders, the bulb trade changed to buying and selling flowers still in the ground. The only thing changing hands, a promissory note which could be resold several times at escalating prices before digging season. Flowers once valued for beauty now became nothing but commodities for profit. First the bidding took place only in the auction house but within a short time taverns across the Netherlands offered their own brand of Las Vegas style entertainment. Dash describes the cold dark smoky atmosphere of the taverns and the sophistication of the Dutch traders.One day the auction opened and no one made a bid. It was all over. Flowers that had been worth thousands a day before could not be sold for any price. People were ruined, debts went unpaidMike Dash, a professional historian and full-time writer, lives in London. This is his third book. He is a Cambridge-educated writer and magazine publisher."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"My fiance bought this book for me at Tulip Time 2005 in Holland Michigan. He was born there and spent his whole life there and I have fallen in love with everything Dutch. I just got to start the book a couple of weeks ago but it has been amazing! It conveys everything about the tulip (which I love)! This book is absolutely great!"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Perhaps a better title would be \\"A few episodes in the long history of the tulip.\\" This book is worth reading although I felt that a lot of pages were spent making the same point over and over. But for me it provided a nice introduction to Dutch history (of which I am completely ignorant) as well an explanation of how an economic \\"bubble\\" works. (Alas, I see a parallel to some current economic situations.) But Dash deals with more than the Dutch mania. He also provides a fairly clear intro into workings of the Ottoman Empire, where the tulip originated and where it later had a renaissance of fashion. He ends the book with a brief discussion of modern developments in tulip breeding and how the world-dominating Holland bulb industry owes its current state to the Tulipomania of the 17th Century. There is also an amusing story at the end of a Chinese \\"Spider Lily\\" mania that occurred at the end of Maoism. This is an informative little book that I would recommend to those with an interest in history, gardening or economics and who don't want to start reading a long book just now."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"This is a fascinating view of the impact of trade on the development of culture, of the limitless capacity of humans to be petty and avaricious, of the naive and inventive efforts of gardeners who knew almost nothing about the biology of plants, and much, much more. Starting with the earliest interest in tulips in (and giving a wonderful overview of the cultural values of) ancient Turkey, the author tracks the rise in European interest, brings the tulip to the Netherlands, introduces us to the individual who all but invented gardening, explains how tulips evolved from intense red flowers to the brightly colored and varied forms they reached under Dutch cultivation, and shows how the social structure of the Netherlands (most particularly Amsterdam) set the stage for one of the great booms and busts in economic history. This ground-breaking work (no pun intended)explores this infamous event in new depth and reads like an adventure novel. Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in almost anything -- it's that eclectic in its narrative scope."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. It is beautifully written, well-researched and it grabs your attention right away and holds it until the very end. I think Mr. Dash realized that even though the book is relatively short, most people would have been bored if the book had only stayed with a narrow focus on tulip varieties and the economic dynamics of the brief period during which the mania flourished. The author made a wise choice by going off into little interesting peripheral areas, such as the origins of the tulip in central Asia, the cultivation of the flower by the Ottoman Turks, and some aspects of social life in 17th century Holland. Did you know that when the flower was popular in Turkey some of the Ottoman soldiers went around with tulips embroidered on their underwear? Due to the Islamic prohibition concerning the artistic depiction of people and real life objects the embroidery of the flower had to be kept &quot;undercover&quot;, so they placed it on the underwear! I don't want to give the impression that the book is a bunch of fluff. Mr. Dash never veers too far from the tulip mania and some of the best chapters in the book concern the botanical, economic and social reasons for the stratospheric heights tulip prices reached. Due to the way tulips reproduce it took a long time for new varieties (which were the most coveted) to be produced in quantity. Trading methods that we use today, such as buying on margin and trading in futures, also helped to fuel the craze, as did the tendency of the people involved to do their trading in taverns while consuming vast quantities of beer! Oh, by the way, I do want to explain the title of this review: In 1562 a shipment of cloth which had been sent from Istanbul arrived in Antwerp. The Flemish merchant who had ordered the cloth also noticed that the shipment contained some type of bulbs. They were tulip bulbs, but the merchant didn't know that. He assumed they were some type of Turkish onion, so he had most of them roasted and he ate them for supper, seasoned with some oil and vinegar!"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Mike Dash's &quot;Tulipomania&quot; is typical of the current crop of &quot;popular&quot; history books. Much like Dava Sobel's &quot;Longitude&quot;, Mr. Dash takes a narrow topic/event and dissects it in great detail, while presenting his findings in a manner that is palatable to the academic and non-academic alike. The Dutch Tulip Craze of 1636-37 is one of the most overworked stories in the world of business, but Mr. Dash does well in interweaving his narrative of the Craze with anecdotal stories of the famous and common people whose lives were affected. The description of economic conditions and everyday life are rich and detailed. (Anyone in the brewing industry will salivate at the beer-consumption figures for Haarlem in 1636!) But the book does not get bogged down in detail and keeps a fast pace. Though not as strong as &quot;Longitude&quot;, &quot;Tulipomania&quot; is a worthy addition to the canon of microhistorical works."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Whether you are a history or a plant buff, the history of the tulip is unquestionably a fascinating topic. If you are both a history and plant buff, like me, this topic is absolutely intoxicating. So deep and thought provoking are the moral and philosophical questions surrounding the tulip craze, it would seem nearly impossible to write a boring book on the subject. Nevertheless, I have read, or attempted to read, some books on this fascinating period of history that have nearly put me to sleep. Tulipomania by Mike Dash captures the essence of what makes the history of this plant so irresistible. Unlike a history book, he doesn&#65533;t get overly bogged down with dates and names. Unlike a horticulture or botany book, he presents some of the technical details of the plant without using technical terms the average reader wouldn&#65533;t appreciate. Rather, Mike Dash tells a story, which just happens to be about a plant, that spans over several hundred years. He paints a colorful picture of personalities, historical towns and, palaces that reads like a novel. However, unlike many novels, this book leaves the reader with many thought provoking questions. The reader is left pondering human social behavior, values, and the prostitution of nature. While enjoyable, this is anything but an empty, pass the time, light reading book. This book should be mandatory reading for all high school students. Mike Dash relays this fascinating saga so clearly; virtually everyone who reads this book will be forever touched. Our society could learn so much from the history of this plant, yet most American schools never even mention this fabulous saga. I know I will make sure my children read this book when they are older."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"The tulip mania of the Dutch Golden Age has been recounted in a number of business, historical and botanical texts, but this was the first book I've read that pulled all the strands together in a concise, well-informed narrative.Mr. Dash's background as a historian surely helped him compile the anecdotes, facts, figures and personal histories that created this book, but his skill as a writer and storyteller turn a worthwhile and informative read into a downright entertaining one. A very successful look back at history that informs without sacrificing the style, fun and detail that the readers look for. Because of this, TULIPOMANIA stands out from the pack. Well done!"},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Many gardeners may believe that the Dutch \\"created\\" the tulip, or that, at the very least, it was native to the region. The truth is, as we can learn from Mike Dash, that botanists introduced tulips to the Dutch after discovering them growing wild in the valleys and oases of the Pamir Mountains in Russia and the Tien Shan that border China. Out of these harsh mountains in Asia, tulips flourished and were held in high esteem by the Ottoman's and are considered sacred in the religion of Islam. By the 16th century, tulips were already being cultivated in Turkish gardens, and in the 1530s, it is rumored, Lopo Vaz de Sampayo brought the tulip to Western Europe for the first time. Over the span of another hundred years of discovery and cultivation, the tulips we know today as \\"Dutch\\" tulips were being sought after with vigor. Beautiful varieties (created, in part, by a mosaic virus) were being bought for a small fortune - and the most rare bulbs could command sums of several years' salary. More a book of incredible sociological and economic history than botanical information, Dash gives an interesting glimpse of the importance of taverns to the tulip trade and explains with detail that tulip mania is one of the earliest cases of futures trading. Although Dash's writing is occasionally repetitive, his study is a quick, easy and interesting read that can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the history of the Netherlands in the 17th century, gardening, economy or sociology."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Looking at history from the particular rather than the general point of view often seems to lead the reader easily into quite interesting perspectives on our past. This engaging, readable, fast paced book adds to my short list of history someone can read even if they don't think they like the genre.Mr. Dash does a great job dragging the reader quickly along a clear path from rare Turkish flower to Dutch icon. Along the way, without much considering it, the reader will learn quite a bit about Europe in the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire, aspects of economics, and how the activities of individuals much like ourselves created trends and offered their nation a new way to trade with the world.There are dot com parallels which add to the historical perpective -- anyone who follows recent economic trends will see parallels in the ways that individuals can follow the leaders into a new market and find their own fortunes."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Tulipomania is an amazing story, wonderfully told. Author Mike Dash has an easy, natural writing style, but he's also a gifted historian - Cambridge-educated, and with a PhD to boot, which makes him among the best qualified of all the writers in the narrative non-fiction genre. And, boy, can he write. To assemble, as Dash has done, more information on the tulip mania than any previous writer (comparing his account to the jejeune and utterly uniformed speculations of Mackay is like comparing a gourmet dinner to a tin of spaghetti) would be an achievement in itself. But the author has not only scoured not only the literature in English, Dutch and German, but also dredged through Dutch archives that have remained untouched for literally centuries - and still managed to turn out a book that is fast-paced, enticingly written and an example of how to move along a history that spans two continents and several decades. Very highly recommended indeed, to all lovers of good history."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"Mike Dash has produced a highly engaging and entertaining account of the great Dutch tulip mania. Indeed, he has done much more than that. What distinguishes this book from other accounts of irrational bubbles and their burst s--of which the Dutch Tulip bubble is often cited as the classic example - is a concentration on tulips themselves - where they came from, whom they enchanted, and how their real connoisseurs were willing to pay fantastic sums for bulbs quite apart from the speculative mania that gripped Holland in 1636-7. The tale is well told, moving at a rapid clip, introducing a variety of captivating characters and proceeding without claiming more knowledge than the somewhat spotty records allow and without taking a high moral tone. Furthermore, the book relates not only the Dutch case of tulip enthusiasm, but also the Turkish one. In a well done afterword, Dash brings the story of flower manias up to the present - or at least to 1985 when a boom in spider lilies occurred in China. A very pleasant read that I found most engaging."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"This slim volume is a remarkably entertaining cultural history of the tulip, focusing its particular attention on the Tulip Bubble of the Netherlands in the 1630s. Dash, however, back up and provides a very readable history of the flower and how it first made its way west to Europe, why it took root, so to speak, in the United Provinces, and how the sale of this flower evolved from the passion of a few dedicated botanists to a financial mania that swept the entire nation. Dash has done his research remarkably well (and I very much like the way he organizes his notes thematically), and he conveys his research in a way that is both erudite and charming. I heartily recommend for fans of popular history, financial history and gardening buffs."},{"Title":"Tulipomania : The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused","review":"A meticulously researched book, but not one I found terribly interesting.

The Tulipomania, as the craze is called, is an oft-cited example of a financial mania, one that has recently been brought up many times to be compared with the internet stock rage. In fact, that is one of the book's main obstacles to overcome, with the Tulipomania such a frequent topic of discussion, the book needed to provide more than a greater re-telling of the event. The book needed to describe in greater depth the true cause of the mania. It fails on both accounts. The book reads as if it was quickly (and poorly) written to capitalize on the resurgence of Tulipomania references in popular media.From the get go the story is loosely ordered, a rambling tale that seems light on research and still heavy on facts. The story never hits its stride, and for the one or two chapters that there is a true story to read, the story that is told fails to do anything more than talk about facts that are already common knowledge. The author chooses not to identify any key characters in the mania, nor does Mr. Dash ever create a feeling that he has systematically thought of how to craft his tale. The words are thrust together, the facts ramble along and at no point does it feel as if a real book has ever been written. As an example, if this review were to be written as the book is, there would be no mention of the author, no talk about the book, no introduction of how the reviewer got to their opinion, etc. etc. The review would read, \\"Books have been written for many years. Recently there was one about the Tulipomania. It didn't seem very good.\\" And then off I'd go. The style of prose is so difficult and taxing that it is problematic to describe in sufficient detail the way that it hinders the few facts that Mr. Dash bothered to dig up.The facts, as I just mentioned, seem few and far between. \\"Tulipomania\\" falls into a genre I think of as \`Topical Histories' (good examples are \\"Cod\\" by M. Kurlansky, \\"The Professor and the Madman\\" by S. Winchester, \\"The Code Book\\" and \\"Fermat's Enigma\\" both by Singh). All of these take topics and present a quick-paced well-researched all-encompassing view of a particular area of history and/or science. \\"Tulipomania\\" never really does this. The facts that are presented are not pursued very deeply, and instead seem to be repeated often and frequently. The repetition begins to appear as an attempt to make up for the number of facts that are introduced, or possibly an attempt to get the reader just to accept them and move on. Mr. Dash repeatedly introduces historical figures with their proper name, giving no further detail of who they are, or even elaborating on their relevance to the text. The lengthy index records numerous proper names with a single reference, inserted and discarded without benefiting the story either factually or by bettering the human interest angle.If you want to learn more about the Tulipomania go read the financial histories, \\"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\\" and \\"Confusi&oacute;n de Confusiones\\" which both treat the episode very well. The only three tidbits that Mr. Dash adds are (I include them here to save you time): (i) the tulip originated in Asia, in Turkish provinces; (ii) the Ottoman Turks were important in the spreading of the flower, and (iii) there were other tulip manias, including one in France preceding the Dutch and others in Turkish areas afterwards.

The author clearly disagrees with himself in different parts of the story (when he discusses the fall of the trade he mentions the demise as being both instantaneous, and not happening immediately), and seems as if he read a few historical documents and then pieces together the story on his own. He spends too much time on insignificant examples or individual tulip purchases (they are not used as supporting information, but used to drive the story), and seems to impress himself with his ability to convert Guilders into Stuivers.

I felt enraged, crazy and bereft, but I couldn't really explain what happened to make me feel the way I felt. I could deal with the abandonment and adultery, but I could not deal with the preplanning that went in to the actual divorce.

I didn't know what I'd seen but it so shook me that I felt weak and sick and went home early. Once at home, I had to lie down even though I was scolding myself for being irrational - it was just a marital argument etc. But it wasn't. I would eventually come to believe that the co-worker's husband was psychologically abused in such a way that the only word I could attach to it was 'rape'. She 'raped' her husband; the idea seemed so preposterous. There was no actual violence. They had two small boys and a girl - he wouldn't leave the marriage under the circumstances and perhaps this emboldened her to do as much damage as she could. His manner during the event suggested that he had been through this stripping of dignity and violation before and that they both knew that she was purposefully adding to his emotional scars, and that she would never let him forget this day.For what crime was she punishing him? He failed to estimate (and schedule) the correct number of moving vans needed to move them out of state on a certain date - now there would be delays. I could not bear to listen to her brag about how she 'taught him' etc.About a year later, I began trying to locate a book that would solve the mystery of what I had witnessed. 'Emotional Rape' is not written by a psychologist or someone in the mental health field; I was both hopeful (because formally science did not recognize this particular 'rape') and worried (what if it was personal pop psychology?)Initially reading through the scenarios at the front of the book, I was disappointed because I believed the book had not captured 'it' and that I would have to keep looking or write about it myself.I gave up on the book for a few weeks and the next time I picked it up again, I started reading further into the book, starting with the description of H.A.L.F factors. Quietly the pieces began to assemble until the painful moment when I 'saw' it; yes the author has defined the crime correctly; I just couldn't see it in the scenarios.The man I saw abused by his wife was indeed emotionally raped. There was such a vile repulsive and evil grimace (almost a smile) on her face as she emotionally raped him - it is the stuff of nightmares. The book is positive and supportive and I owe a debt of gratitude to the author. I believe that among the personality disorders, those strong in sociopaths traits are more likely to emotionally rape, followed closely by narcissistic personality disorder."},{"Title":"The Emotional Rape Syndrome: How to Survive and Avoid It","review":"I always thought That there was some good in everybody despite having been sodomized as a child. Until I met Glen. A little while ago I heard in a movie that beware, evil can find it's way thru a crack in the wall. Boy is that ever true. Almost 40 I'm sure he was happy to have almost destroyed me."},{"Title":"The Emotional Rape Syndrome: How to Survive and Avoid It","review":"This book is quick and easy to read. It really is about various people exploiting others to their own ends without having any regard to the emotional damage they cause.It conveys that victims need to realise that their unbalanced emotional state is not their fault and that they should not punish themselves for not realising that they had been duped or deliberately misled, despite the fact that some of them did have niggly misgivings at the beginning of their relationships.What I don't agree with in the book is that people should have prenuptial agreements. The author thinks that this would not destroy romantic feelings. In most cases, romantic feelings are not the only reason for getting married. The ordinary man on the street seeks, in reality, to fulfill his domestic and emotional needs and gives rewards when these are met. Love may or may not be one of the rewards. Often it may be only material things. It seems that most rich men seek beautiful women to adorn their side and have their children. Only a few men marry for romance and love. So for this author to expect women to agree to prenuptial agreements does seems strange for a psychoanalyst who believes in fairness. This would be unfair because women do not live in a fair society and most women have to give up their jobs to stay at home and look after their children. Therefore, to leave the marriage with nothing would be extremely unfair when men have continued access to earning money. As for Donald Trump, with his brain and eye for business he may have seen his wife as a commodity and a worthy adornment at his side. Therefore, it only seems fair that she should be given alimony to continue the lifestyle she had become accustomed to for a very long period of time. He obviously had not been exploited and went on to marry another beautiful woman. The author using their divorce proceedings as an example was not in my view helpful to his case.If prenuptials were to take effect, it would be best for women not to marry at all because they can gain more wealth through being single than if they got married and only took back what they had put in at the start of the marriage. It is during the marriage a women gives up a lot of herself while most men continue doing what they did before they got married.Therefore, in my view, the author failed to be realistic about how people could avoid being hurt and face some devasting fall-outs. However, he attempts to make people aware of the pitfalls of getting married without really knowing their potential spouses and how this can be detrimental to their well-being and their ablilty to trust and love again. What he should have mentioned is that romantic love is not enough in itself a good reason for getting married but that people need be aware, sexual attraction aside, that mutual respect and kindness plus mutual tolerance and a good sense of humour is the best basis for a successful and happy marriage."},{"Title":"GURPS Technomancer (GURPS: Generic Universal Role Playing System)","review":"The stated intent of GURPS: TECHNOMANCER was to create a world where high-tech and magic co-existed WITHOUT it being cyberpunk. TECHNOMANCER accomplishes this intent very well. The book posits a world where the Trinity nuclear test ripped open the fabric of space and produced a Hellstorm that &quot;irradiated&quot; a good portion of the United States, producing areas of high mana where magic could be worked by anyone with the genes to be a mage. Magical mutation produced more and more mages over time to the modern day. Now set in the present, the world of TECHNOMANCER has been indelibly stamped with the workings of magic. This has resulted in such oddities as industrial-line mages, magical spies, dragons as part of the U.S. Forces in Vietnam, flying sports carpets, and Departments of Magic in certain universities. Although it is written for the GURPS game system (you must have a copy of the GURPS Main Rules to use the mechanics in this book), the wealth of ideas in this book can be adapted to any game system. Steve Jackson Games spoke of supporting TECHNOMANCER with future supplements. I hope they do!

It really was a turning point for me in many ways.It offers many ideas you might find in other places, but some I have not seen elsewhere.

That is not necessarily as easy as it sounds, since having too many plan B's or not having a REAL plan can swallow you up and you get nowhere.Wish I had read this a long time ago!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"One day, a student of Socrates asked his venerable teacher how to become wise. Socrates led the student to a nearby lake and the two entered the water. Then, he held the student's head under the surface as the frantic young man fought wildly. Finally, Socrates freed him. The young man gasped and gulped. Socrates watched calmly and said, \\"When you desire wisdom with the same intensity that you desire to breathe, then nothing will stop you from getting it.\\" Brian Tracy uses this graphic anecdote to discuss the intensity of thought and feeling that should accompany the work of setting your goals, a potentially life-changing exercise. Every chapter of Tracy's well-written book contains counsel about achieving your dreams as well as practical advice on perfecting your life. Tracy uses plenty of illustrative examples, such as the Socrates story. He reviews many classic motivational tools and techniques. Some self-help authors lure people into wasting hard-earned time and money on books that don't motivate or inspire. However, getAbstract recommends Tracy as a genuine teacher with much to convey about using the power of your mind for personal growth. And if the message here echoes his other books, it is no less valuable for that."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I want to underline every word so that I don't forget it.

His message in simple & obvious, but with this book Brian shows you why & how so many of us don't or can't succeed in our ambitions to be happy & successful, when it is the right of everyone to enjoy life to the full.If you've read his other book \\"GOALS!\\" first, then don't despair. This book has exactly the same message but goes much deeper into the workings of how health, wealth, happiness & peace of mind can all be achieved, providing you with a dearth of inspiration & motivation to try it out instantly & get going straight way.This book is a little larger & a little harder going than \\"Goals!\\", only in that the chapters aren't broken down into convenient sections where you can pause & take a breath/ Nonetheless, it is written in such an enthusiastic way that keeps you interested all the way.This ought to be the very last book you buy on the subject, but before you read (& more importantly re-read) it, please make sure you have a fresh note-book (preferably A4) & pen to hand. The book is jam packed with all the essential information to kick you off in the right direction the minute you start reading.If you've got this far already then you need this book, look no further, your intuition was right in looking here.

And his practical tools and techniques are very simple to use.Brian has a unique way to say and explain things that goes straight into your heart and you feel the power of each word to be true.The mental laws he talks about have generated wealth and wisdom to every person that applied them. The law of attraction, the law of correspondance, the law of cause and effect are only three of the laws that will catapult you to success.His way of programming your mind for success is great. Autogenic conditioning, all the affirmation and vizualisation tools will teach you the power of positive focus.I've even used the power of superconscious mind to find parking spots during peak traffic hours and it surprisingly works.

His books are easy to read and easy to digest. He has a way with words that makes it easily accessible and interesting to read his insights.His Best SellerMaximum Achievement is his best selling book (he has written about 40) and the one he strongest recommends.After reading Million Dollar Habits and Goals! I decided I should read his best work.I was not disappointedIt is a comprehensive guide to success covering everything from The laws of success too parenting.Below I have given a short overview of each chapter and their contents.The Laws of Success - For example the law of control, the law of cause and effect, the law of belief, the law of expectations, the law of attraction, the law of correspondence, the law of mental equivalency and many more scattered throughout the book.Your Master Program - How your mind controls everything and if you feed it the right messages (program) it will set you on the course to success.The Master Mind - Pushing knowledge into the subconscious and getting your mental computer to work 24 hours/day on your goals.The Master Skill - In this chapter Brian shares his views on goal setting, my article \\"How to set goals that will make you rich\\" is closely related to Brian's views on this subject, he discusses how you need clarity to your goals, putting them on paper in the positive present tense and the importance of deadlines.The Master Power - The superconscious mind, what the psychologist Carl Jung calls the collective unconscious, this is something you might or might not believe in, but the examples in the chapter are interesting all the same, it is a chapter worth reading, if nothing else for the insights you might receive.The Master Decision - The most important part of success is understanding and accepting that it is completely up to you. If you succeed it is thanks to you, if you do not, it is your fault.This is hard for many to accept, that everything that has happened to them up to this point is because of decisions they have made.The Master Goal - Your highest goal must be happiness, clarity and the ability to relax and love yourself and others. This will open the doors for all other successes. But putting this ahead of everything else is difficult and short term gains can often lure us to not put our happiness first, but if we don't, all our other relationships and opportunities will deteriorate in the long run.Human Relationships - Your relationships with others are what will mark your successes and your failures. By learning to be a better listener, conversationalist and person, you will quickly improve your chances of success.Personal Relationships - The difference between friendship and loving relationships is how much you are together and how dependent your are on each other. You need to master personal relationships to be able to truly become a complete person.The Art of Parenting - The most important endeavour we ever undertake is parenthood, I have not yet myself but it is what I consider the most important thing I will ever do, if I fail all else that is what I hope to accomplish. What you do as a parent will affect your children, their children and the children of generations to come.Love - You aren't complete without love. You need to love yourself to love others and you need to feel love to be able to function. This is probably the most important part of your life, do not do it half heartily.He gives credit to his resourcesI really like that Brian Tracy freely shares credit where credit is due. Whenever he takes an idea or principal from someone else (even if they could be considered a competitor) he says so, he writes \\"As X says in his book Y ...\\"This shows great character and that he himself practices what he preaches.The use of the advice has helped me a lotI have followed Brian's teachings for a long time and I have always had great results with his techniques. This time was no difference. Simple tips to focus, such as \\"the quick affirmation technique\\" - you close your eyes, visualize the result you are hoping for, load it with emotions and then release it - has helped me improve my confidence before a meeting and have helped me become a more skilled salesman and coach.I have used his advice and many of my articles use his work for inspirationMy article about Planning for your success is very much based on Brian Tracy's ideas and insights.He repeats himself a lot!The reason the book is 350 pages instead of 280 is because he repeats himself constantly. This helps you remember it but once in a while it feels as though he copied one paragraph and put it in 4 different places.Everything will not fit youAll the advice might not be suited especially to you and since Brian Tracy is a very religious man there are some parts that you might not be interested in following, if you aren't religious yourself, if so, skip those parts and move on to the advice that makes sense to you and will help you succeed.Shorter ways to succeedBrian Tracy gives a complete guide to success in Maximum Achievement. If you are looking for a shorter guide to riches and fame I recommend you read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" By Napoleon Hill instead.Value vs. Cost, a no brainerThe tips and advice given in the book more than warrants the 10 dollars + shipping that is asked for. If you implement only a few of the techniques you can double, triple and even quadruple your income.Most of it can be implemented today for instant resultsWhat is great is that most of the advice can be used at once, you can start to use the techniques today and already tomorrow you will start to see a difference.Who should read itIf you are looking to quickly put your career on the fast track, are willing to work hard to succeed, willing to believe in the laws that determine success and start thinking about your overall goals and dreams you are in the right place for this book.It will help you go from where you are today to where you want to go, faster than you can even imagine."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Mark F.

But \\"Maximum Achievement\\" is always my first choice whenever I need to brush up on personal success lessons.*Easy to read. No complicated psycho-babble. Just down-to earth, easily applicable tools you can use to adopt the mindsets and habits of a successful person.*Brian Tracy lays success out in such a simple, obvious way that you find yourself going \\"well, duh! I should have known that all along!\\" These are simple, common-sense truths, but ones that the majority of people just aren't aware of or choose to ignore. He lays them out for you and helps you find the motivation to integrate them into your life.*The section on the \\"self-concept\\" was mind-blowing for me personally. Particularly how it relates to \\"success-barriers\\" and how people rarely, if ever experience a level of success that's not consistent with how they see themselves. He talks about how people who come into a sudden windfall of money will actually do things to SCREW THINGS UP, so that they can get back into a financial situation that's more familiar to them. After reading that, the behavior of some suddenly famous celebrities almost starts to make sense...well almost, lol.It was actually reading about the self-concept in Tracy's \\"The Psychology of Selling\\" that led me to this book, since it's such a fascinating concept. I've since explored it further in books like \\"Psycho Cybernetics\\" by Maxwell Maltz, which I also recommend.All in all, this book is gold in the right hands, and in others it'll end up collecting dust on the shelf.

However this is not in fact the truth. Brian Tracy's book is a pseudo-uplifting read that leaves you with the nice warm fuzzy feeling that we can all be millionaires tomorrow if we just write it down and &quot;visualize&quot; the desired outcome, and anything else is just cynicism. But in fact there is almost nothing of practical value in this entire phone-book length text. Tracy tells us repeatedly about his own life story, and offers list after list of the &quot;7 most important things in life&quot; followed by &quot;the 7 biggest priorities in life&quot; and the &quot;7 things in life that have the most value&quot; etc. The intrusively repetitive nature of this book is a major credibility alert - if each point were only made once the whole thing would be about ten pages long; so obviously the remainder is junk. Secondly, the examples used are very thin on substance, even to those who want to believe - like Tracy's claim that he wrote down all the things he and his wife desired in their dream home and forgot about it, then a year later they bought a house with every feature on the list except for a central vacuum system. Sure, lets assume this is true - but how much does that proove when he was already a millionaire from selling his books and seminars? Couldn't he have afforded just about any kind of house anyway?

It helped me to resolve some long-standing issues.I have lent it to friends and they always share my enthusiasm, often commenting that one may open it randomly to anywhere in the book, and just start learning."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I just bought and finished this book and I can tell that it will be referenced often and a big part of my library. The \\"laws\\" mentioned in this book are great to read over and over again. The last 100 pages, however, are filler. He seems to repeat himself over and over about relationships, parenting and other issues. If he would have left that stuff out, I'd give it five stars. I would recommend Eat that Frog or The Ultimate Goals Program on audio instead."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book covers an array of subjects but in essence it's a book for anyone looking at achieving success in life."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"My aunt is very successful &amp; once recommended this book to me. She told me she made a list of goals she wanted in life &amp; forgot about it. Later on, she stumbled across the list &amp; she had attained most of her goals without realizing it. Because I respect her so much, I bought it &amp; read it enthusiastically.I consider myself to be a very successful person (i.e. I'm very happy in life &amp; with my career). I read this book a couple of years ago &amp; attribute it to my current success. I'm re-reading it now to get further ahead in life (a house &amp; money!). I bought copies for all my family last Christmas &amp; have recommended it to all my friends too.My favorite thing it states is that your subconsious mind can't tell if your conscious mind is telling the truth. Ever have a dream so vivid you can't remember if it really happened? If you keep telling yourself you're thin, rich, a non-smoker, or whatever your goal is, eventually your subconsious mind believes it &amp; works to make it happen. Obviously it is not that simple, so go read the book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I read every word of this book.

Your bright future unfolds as you take action with Brian Tracy as your coach through this excellent book."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I have a library of over 100 self helpbooks plus tapes and have attended allthe seminars. Clearly, Brian Tracy is the best. If you only have the time to read one book, this should be that one book. The techniques work and work fast. You will learn how to enhance all areas of your life. Most other books repeat the same things, not Brian. I also highly recommend the audio tape program, Pyschology of Achievement and the Pyschology of Selling by Brian and SuperSelf by Charles Givens, probably one of the most under rated books out there on personal development."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Brian Tracy has been one of my success mentors for years. His wisdom is clear and eloquent - but more than that it is right on! Even before you finish reading Maximum Achievement for the first time, you will be a changed person - it's that incredible. I say first time because you will want to read it again and again.Brian Tracy covers all of the proactive bases: smart thinking, system thinking, futuristic thinking, and positive thinking. If you are truly seeking the kind of success and abundance that makes your life 100% livable - you must read this book. Many of his ideas are found in SUCCESS BOUND, another book built on learning how to be responsible and live proactively.Everything that I have put into practice that he has recommended has worked. The laws of success in this book will bring you success. Read it and you will believe that you can do anything that you set your mind to. My copy is well worn with highliter and pen marks all through it from the numerous times that I've returned to it in order to study it again.You will find that this exciting book becomes a part of you. Don't hold back - let it happen. In fact, you should spend 10 to 15 minutes every morning focusing your thoughts on the truths of this book, thereby allowing them to seep deep into your subconscious mind. If you do this I guarantee this wisdom will most assuredly bring you the success and abundance you deserve.Enjoy the book and your new proactive life!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This is a remarkable work by Brian Tracy who is indeed a remarkable man. As Tracy tells us, he was quite a problem in his younger years, dropped out of high school and with no education was relegated to low paying deadend jobs.But then something changed in Tracy. He went into straight commission selling seeing an opportunity to write his own paycheck and met some very successful salesmen. He learned how to sell and sell well, but more importantly, he learned the miracle of personal development. He went to work on himself and the rest as they say is history.In MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT, Brian Tracy will show you everything you need to make rapid advances in your life. Personally, socially, with your career, in relationships and more.I remember when Amazon used to give ten stars. If they were still doing that MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT would be a true 10 star book.

I couldn't put it down. I took notes while I read it, doing the practice exercises. I've read a bunch of books on self-improvement, and this one is the best so far. You won't need another self-imrovement book (at least until you read this one about five times). It is written in a friendly and concise language.It is truly an inspiring and uplifting book. After reading even a few pages, you can't help but ponder over it and imagine yourself in a world you'd ultimately want to be in, the goals you'd want to have achieved, and the plan to do it all. You'll think, &quot;This works for me. He (Brian Tracy) is right&quot; And you'll go on and you'll do everything you've been wanting to do for a long time. And you'll succeed. I guarantee it.I will recommend this book to everyone I know. It's worth your money. Read it. You won't regret."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"When i found this book I was living hand to mouth with no \\"instruction manual\\" on how to get out of my desperate situation.I was 26 yrs old,owned a 15 year old Ford T-Bird that leaked oil and with the interior cloth roof hanging down on me. I was selling cd's to buy groceries until my next paycheck, etcAfter reading this book my life changed dramatically...Within 5 months i decided to pursue my piece of the pie by changing my thinking and taking resposibility for my actions.I grew up poor in the projects in chester, Pa, i still remeber the racial wars between the whites and blacks.....people shooting one another from my rooftop in the ghetto row housing me and my 3 siblings lived with no father . I was pre-programmed into thinking that i was not going to turn out to be a success.Well......after reading MAX-ACHiement...In 1995, within 1 year i owned my own Financial PR Company...my highest earnings year has been $400,000..... in 1999 i took my own company public (different company)and sold it to another company (I own stock that is worth 4 mill). I am currently working back in Financial PR and made $120,000 last year. Already in the month of Jan. 2006 i have made $25,000.Sounds like a paid endorsment, doesn't it. Well my freinds...it's not. I have read this book at least 10 times and it has made a profound impact on my life. You may ask \\"This book did all of this for him\\"?Answer: It forced me to take FULL responsibility for my position in life. You are where you are because of your prior actions you decided to take in the past. If you want change, \\"YOU\\" must change. It is your life and nobody will come knocking on your door to hand over what life has to offer. Go out and get your share.

I must admit that I have been very fortunate that I have.When I was growing up as a teenager, coming from a disadvantaged background, I thought that people that were better off than me were just lucky. I thought that luck was something that happened to people and that there was nothing that anyone could do about it. In other words, I thought that people that were happy, people that were successful, and people that lead happy and fulfilling lives were just lucky. I thought that people's lives were destined. But as I grew older I witnessed people that used to be known as \\"losers\\" starting to succeed, and \\"winners\\" starting to fail. By my late teens the whole concept of luck and destiny did not quite make sense to me. I refused to accept that my whole life was a product of chance, luck, and destiny. I started to look for answers, answers that no one in my environment could give me.Then, one day while looking for my answers, I ran across one of Brian Tracy's articles about success on the net. I was amazed by Brian's knowledge, professionalism, and writing style. The next day I went to the library to find some of his books. The only book that I could find was his \\"The Luck Factor\\" Audio Book, which came in handy since I hated to read.Then I decided to purchase Maximum Achievement. This was the first book that I have read from cover to cover and my life has never been the same ever since. The principles in this book are nothing new or innovational, they are merely simple and while reading you will often catch yourself saying over and over again: \\"That is so true! I should have known about this! Why didn't I think of this a long time ago?\\" But don't let that discourage you from getting this book.Brian Tracy is the best self help professional in the world and I would not recommend anybody else but him. There are many \\"self help\\" gurus and books out there, but as you read their material you will start to notice inconsistencies and contradictions in their work. As with Brian Tracy, I have not found any contradiction, inconsistency, or lies in his work. And I am very sensitive when it comes to people trying to teach me some \\"cool stuff\\". I check every reference, every background, and every quote that I can. Brian Tracy's integrity has never disappointed me. I would have given this book 10 stars if I could because it's still one of the best books that I have ever read!I have read many books after this one, but only a few were worth every penny and every second that I have invested in reading as this one!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Some years ago, when I was at my lowest point in life, I borrowed a friend's car who had the cassettes for Maximum Achievement in her tape deck.

You need to like and respect yourself more before you can love and respect others.- Never criticize- You are where you are because of your past decisions- You are responsible for everything that happened in your life, so stop blaming.- Peace of mind is essential to success in everything.

And what is even more important is that it is proven, tested and works for everyone.You will also find information here not available anywhere else. If you were to buy just one book, this one should be that book. It covers everything. Brian's techniques such as autosuggestion, affirmations, writing goal cards, and autogenic conditioning offer quick, permanent results.I never tire of Tracy.

I have been on a roll with my reading selections. Here is another fascinating book by another great author, Brain Tracy. Let me say it again Brian Tracy really knows how to assist you in performing a self analysis on your past present and future experiences and thoughts. He asks riveting questions that make you use your imagination, exercise your subconscious mind and feed your brain with the most powerful enlightening visions to set you on a path to great success. I believe that in growing up, a lot of individuals get lost in the way of society and the limitations that the world puts on our thinking and life. Of course growing up in this fashion is not at all our fault it is partly our parents fault and I say partly because no-one taught them. Any one that has made several past or present mistakes would benefit greatly from this book. Even to the individual that has not made many mistakes and has been afforded a somewhat decent life would benefit from this book. If you are tired of living within the boundaries of the world and you have reached a point where you want more for yourself but you are having trouble moving past the events that have happened in the past this is the book for you. Or anyone that is having trouble focusing on their thoughts to reach their ultimate goals should most definitely pick up this book. You will not regret it, this book is so powerful. The value of the contents inside this book is priceless. This is another book in which my husband and I sit down weekly and discuss the contents and complete the exercises. Ladies I have been attempting to drill success into my husband's ear for years and it has not helped, not one bit. But since we have begin reading this book amongst others and performing the exercises he is beginning to change, and not because I am drilling him but because he is now able to do a self analysis of himself and see the gray areas that have been greatly affecting his life, which is, inevitably our life. I can't emphasize enough how powerful this book is."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I started studying success advice since 2 years ago. And now, I am experiencing the greatest success and happiness of my life. My income is rising rapidly and there seems to be no limit of how high I can go anymore. Brian Tracy's advice is not merely \\"motivational\\" nor is it b.s. or voodoo. No. Brian Tracy is a scientist of success. He just gives you 100% true, effective advice that works like a science. If you study his materials over and over and over endlessly and take notes and start living his principles 1 by 1 until you are doing everything he advises, you will eventually be very successful and very happy and living exactly the life that you want. It won't even take very long, because you will be so focused and well-guided. Internalize it so thoroughly that you naturally follow his advice even if you don't remember exactly the words he said about a particular situation. To me, his words are the gospel and I live them and they permeate my entire being. I always look for deeper understanding and nuances that I previously missed every time I re-study one of his materials. I want to be rich so bad, and now I am finally rocketing to that goal. My income is getting good and it's rising like a rocket. I'm a lot more productive and well-directed than I used to be, and more skilled and confident. I quit my job that I hated a few days ago. I have my own online business and will never again work for someone else. I get up every day extremely excited about what I'm going to do next to increase my income. My dreams are no longer just dreams but are starting to feel like my reality, like they're getting really close to being realized. I already achieved my dream of not working for other people and being both free and having an income. I'm kind of giddy about my recent success. This is the best thing that could happen to me. So believe me, Brian Tracy is the real deal and everything he says really works. Just have faith. Don't even question that it works. Just do it. Brian is the best, but I also recommend learning from the other top success gurus such as: Harv Eker, Napoleon Hill, Brad Yates, Dan Kennedy, and Joe Vitale. Your dream life is waiting for you.

This book has exactly the same message but goes much deeper into the workings of how health, wealth, happiness & peace of mind can all be achieved, providing you with a dearth of inspiration & motivation to try it out instantly & get going straight way.This book is a little larger & a little harder going than \\"Goals!\\", only in that the chapters aren't broken down into convenient sections where you can pause & take a breath/ Nonetheless, it is written in such an enthusiastic way that keeps you interested all the way.This ought to be the very last book you buy on the subject, but before you read (& more importantly re-read) it, please make sure you have a fresh note-book (preferably A4) & pen to hand.

All too often these success books fail to take into consideration our home life and how our upbringing affects our success. Brian nails it correctly when he says we have to forgive those in our life (such as our parents), for harm we may have received. When forgiveness occurs, we can move forward. All too often the success books are pure pollyanna (which I love as well), but forget that drug addicts, drunks and others will not be as nearly successful as they could if they just dealt with some of the issues holding them back. On the positive side, lots of good things in this book that makes it one of my 'desert island' books."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Brian Tracey is perhaps one of the best motivation coaches of the last 10 years.This book not only inspires you from a career or entrepreneur point of view,but also life period.The way Mr.Tracy covers every aspect of how to better yourselfas a whole.If succeeding in life is your goal this is a good blue print."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"We all have &quot;band-aids&quot; for depression, worry , and fear, but to really be able to cure the cause we have to go deep inside ourselves. This book shows us that what we are is what we have learned over time. Everything that has been learned can be &quot;un-learned&quot;. Every negative thought or reaction to stressors in our lives can be illiminated, or at least controlled, through the methods outlined in this book. It is by far the best book I have ever read. It saved me."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Maximum Achievement is a tremendous book. It's like a modern day version of &quot;Think and Grow Rich,&quot; and &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; and A goal setting seminar all in one. Also there are many step by step exercises to help you develop your skills. A book that should be reread over and over again."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This is probably not the best way to buy a book but after seeing all the 5 stars that this book get from the reviews I felt it must be a very good book. I am sorry to say that I am disappointed. This book tells you what you should do but not HOW to do it. Perhaps after reading Tony Robbins book Awaken the giant within I was not able to appreciate this book. It is amazing how many poeple give this book 5 stars but I must say I agree with the previous user who said that this book is just fluff. I couldn't agree more with that person."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"The first half of this book is a sensational glomeration of all the best 'self helps', and is tied together extremely well. However, Some contradictions start creeping in midway, and with the exception of the &quot;Power of Love&quot; chapter, the second half fails to maintain the standard of the chapters up to and including the goal setting techniques. Maybe Maximum Acheivement tried to cover too many bases with one book, and lost me towards to the end."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Excelent focus on the subject of giving Direction and setting goals as a way of life. I want to contact the suthor to make a translation to spanish, because here at Latin America we does not have those cultural references about goal setting and it will be much useful to many people here."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"One of the finest,most comrprehensive book on success ever written by one of the greatest success expert of our time.

Most of his stuff is taken from the great Earl Nightingale."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I am constantly reading motivational books. When I read Tracy I realized that he was the best of his kind. I highlighted all of the most pertinent information, and upon looking back through the book, there is not one un-marked page.

I am also very in to motivational tapes, and he makes the best."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This guy has has had nothing new to say in at least ten years.

Publishers should be ashamed of continuing to promote this loser."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Brian Tracy is one of my all time favorite authors. Maximum Achievement was the first book I read in the self-development genre more than ten years ago. The book is packed with practical information and Tracy knows his human psychology. He answers questions like: What drives human beings? What motivates us? Why don't we take action on knowledge we already have?The information on goal setting contained in the book can change your life, like it did mine. I have been an avid goal setter ever since I read the book, but also very spiritually inclined. Balancing the two is not as much of a problem as one might think in the beginning. Many authors pretend to have all the answers on different topics, but when it comes to success psychology and goal setting, Tracy really has all the answers.If you are looking for answers to why some people succeed and why others don't - READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book is all the things that anyone could want to get your life a jump start to bigger and better things. For starters tracy presents a system for achivement that is not just a re-hash or synthesis of everything you have already read. It presents his system in a clear precise way that is beneficial to anyone in any walk of life. You don't have to be in sales.This book motivates, stimulates and helps you focus your mind on meeting your goals. He helps you in defining your goals and meeting them. Yes this is a PMA thesis but there is much more.Finally tracy does what any worthwhile motivational teacher will do. He tells you that you will have to work hard. There is no attempt to portend that success can be had with a handful of magical formulas. You need to organize your thoughts, think positively and then do it! This book will help you do that.Maximum achievement is the think and grow rich of this generation. I recommend it to everybody on earth!.............socks"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"The book offers you valuable suggestions on how to succeed in life and how to achieve the balance between personal, family and professional life. Gives you practical suggestions how to improve yourself as a person (employee, boss, colleague, father, husband, friend) and how to unleash your real potential.

Is good to have it in your library for reference."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I've read the scriptures several times, have read many books on philosophy, wisdom, logic, and self-help books and even many works of psychology/psycotherapy, all of which were helpful and insightful but nothing compares with the advice, counsel and wisdom offered in this one book.Brian Tracy has literally hit the nail on the head and if you've ever wanted to know ALL the secrets of life and the real path to truth, happiness and success, this would be the book. What is so incredible is he presents all of the truths and wisdom in such an informal and entertaining way, you can't help but understand and savor every page. This book would easily make the National Best Sellers List if it were more widely known.I feel the title says it all, however one might dismiss the book because of the title as it appears to be just another self-help- me-too. Perhaps a more proper title would be: &quot;The Book of Life&quot; Do yourself and those around you a favor and read this book. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I am generally not interested in book of this kind for the simple reason that I think I have worked out a set of rules myself for achieving things in life.However, I was hit by some bad lucks a year ago, and I had doubt in my rules. I am not a believer in luck because I believe to live a successful life is a science. Therefore, I started to find books that I think might help me to improve myself.Let me tell you that this book did just what I wanted it to do for me. It offered some great theories and ideas that I ignored before. The book is so rich that it covers almost all the important concepts of being successful both in life and work.If you want to be successful and happy in life, this book is a must read. Actually, I picked this book as my Christmas present to my friends."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I've read several hundred books about self improvement and reaching my potential.

It is packed with a lot of good information and insights and is really uplifting, but on a very practical and pragmatic level. It doesn't give you a lot of BS or vague general platitudes, and does provide a lot of useful stuff in my opinion. And it covers a pretty broad range of topics, on how to be more effective. I keep it handy to refer back to and re-read."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book motivates, stimulates and helps you focus your mind on meeting your goals.

I bought three copies of this book in three different languages just to make sure that I really understand what this book is saying.I was so impressed with what Brian Tracy has said in this book, especially about guilt and self worth. It is unlike what has been said in other personal development books. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book is outstanding.

This is an excellent book because you get several great books in one. Brian Tracy talks about autosuggestion, your world within = your world without, the master mind, positive mental attitudes, affirmations, treasure maps aka visioning board, visualization, affirmations and whatnot.Maximum Achievement is a excellent book because it is very clearly and concisely written. He outlines the Laws and goes into details. Then, he gives his personal examples and others' examples. I especially apreciate all the insprational poems and quotes.

I bought the book for my daughter who recently graduated from college as a licensed massage therapist and is starting out in her career. Aside from the section that discusses the importance of setting specific goals and focusing on them, this book is mostly a mishmash of New Age philosophies that if you believe something will happen, it will happen, per Oprah's The Secret.Guess what. You can believe you will fly, but if you go up in a skyscraper and jump out the window, you are going to crash and die. The world is full of people with delusions of grandeur and no substance, and books like this are contributing to this.This book is just a rehash of the same kind of Oprah religion, also witchcraft, the law of this, the law of that from the Land of Make Believe. These \\"laws\\" (per The Secret, also Pat Robertson promotes these \\"laws\\") may work in Wunderland, but in the real world they do not work. Sure, it is good to be confident and believe in what you are doing and have hope for success, but you don't need to hype yourself and adopt a kind of insanity, a New Age religion, (that says your thoughts cause things to form and happen) to accomplish self-confidence. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Knowing what you are doing and working hard will give the same confidence.I skimmed through the book and threw it in the trash."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book has really helped me alot. It opened my eye's. I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"If someone can cite the Yale study Brian Tracy references that demonstrates the effectiveness of goal setting, I'll change this review to 5 stars.None of the successful people I've known ever wrote down their goals, that I'm aware of (and I can't imagine them doing so).The only ppl who write goals are the same ppl who buy these books (I'm one of them)...not successful people.It's amazing how many times I've heard Tracy say, \\"Champions do this, successful people do this,\\" as if he's noticed these champions perform this strange, obscure behavior. No, he just think the behavior makes sense to him, so he claims that champions do must do it."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Success in the current society means making a man into machine, and if you want to become an efficient machine, this book is for you my friends. All goal orientation only means that you are not happy and fulfilled in this moment and think that you will be able to in the future. It is the biggest lie and these kind of book do nothing but only this stuff. We are not machine, do not try to become one. To all of us life has provided everything in abundance, enough food, air, water, sex. So why to become restless. I gave this book 2 stars because of it's last chapter on love. Else look around you, all the restless people, outcome of this kind of books"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This book turned my life and my world around . I went from self doubt and self sabbotage to starting two businesses in less than a year and making both of them successful ventures. The laws of success in this book will make you not only believe that you can it will put you in a constant state of knowing that you can. The laws and principles in this book flat out make sense and work, bottom line, plain and simple, just apply them and live them. In closing I chose to write this review as a service to humanity or anyone who needs to create for themselves all they want in life."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I've read around 20 books on personal achievement, self improvement, and psychology this year and out of all those books, this book is my favorite. It has everything. After reading this book, not only will you have a greater knowledge of human behavior but you will also apply these incredible concepts into your living. One of my favorite chapters was the goal setting. Tracy not only shows you how to set goals but most importantly, especially to people who feel lost in this world, he guides you to discover what is your ultimate passion in life.I thought I knew what I wanted in life but still had doubts but after reading this book, I feel much more confident in my goals and dreams of becoming who I truly want to be. Get this book. This book will help you find purpose in life. With a purpose, you will begin to live life with ultimate bliss. Good luck."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"If you are looking for a book, that will inspire you more than any other book you have read, this would be the one. I first came to know of Brian Tracy while in a book store a month ago, i picked up the book titled ' Advance Selling Strategies' it was that book that really hit me, i would encourage you to buy that book, forget the titile this book is about life and most of all its about human behaviour, And its true most other books seem to repeat themselves but not Brian Tracy, Do yourself a favour, pick up this book, and Become the president of your own company, be the best you can be in evey aspect of your life, build that libary which will give you the knowledge and skills to be the very best you can be, any single day we can make any decision that will change our lives for ever, What is it that you want to achieve, have you written it down yet.

This book can help you both professionally and personally. I had listened to a set of tapes by Brian Tracy and craved more. I bought this book and took careful notes as I read it and I committed to immediately begin applying some of Brian's techniques. Within two weeks my wife wanted to know what revelation I had experience that had changed me into a better husband and father. My employees also wanted to know where are all these great visions and ideas were coming from and could I help them reach the new level I was now on. However, the greatest part of all this is that I know I have just scratched the surface of my potential. This book is relevant to you no matter what your profession or where you are in life. If you read it, commit to applying the principles Brian shares, you can unleash your potential and achieve everything and anything you want."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Brian Tracy's Maximum achievement is a very easy to read book which will at least help you to think more positively. There isn't too much detail in this book unlike Tony Robbin's \\"Unlimited Power\\". It is best that you really have a good idea of how to properly visualize beforehand because this book doesn't really spoon feed beginners. There isn't anything magical or instant about this book either. It really just helped me to have a positive attitude. I felt that \\"Unlimited Power\\" gave me better directions on strong visualizations and Robbin's exercises were more instant pushing me towards my goals. However, Maximum Achievement did a better job of selling me on my ability to shape my own destiny because of how well written it was."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"Think and Grow Rich will be always be my bible for achievement and how the power of your mind will make your dreams come true; however Tracy's book had the most inspiring, powerful impact on me that a book has ever had.Tracy supplies very specific steps to take for anyone wishing to be more than average, and provides &quot;mind tools&quot; that were known since before Hill. The value in this book, to me, is having all of the powerful techniques you would ever need explained so simply, and all conveniently available in just one book.You need to buy this, read each chapter twice, and then leave it on your shelf, consulting it for the rest of your life. Bottom line, though, is the fact that this is one of those books which is useless if you use it as a temporary &quot;pump-up&quot; and put it away without using any of the specific techniques in it!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I first read this book when I was 20. At the moment I was attending college but had some of the worst \\"luck\\" that anyone by my age had in terms of financial difficulty, health injuries, car problems, family dysfunctionality, the whole gamut. This book was a tremendous revelation in teaching me to take personal responsiblity for my actions and for the goals I wanted to achieve during my lifetime. What was most remarkable was that the way Mr. Tracy wrote about his situation and his mentality in his early 20s paralleled mine in so many ways - I knew I couldn't put the book down and upon completing the exercises I had established a precedent for great improvement in my life.After returning to read this book three years later, I must say it is amazing how far I've come in improving my \\"luck\\" which comes with preparation and the right positive attitude. Despite the very difficult circumstances that many youth grow up in today, I know with the help of the principals in this book that it is possible to eliminate the \\"negatives\\" from one's environment and greatly boost one's lifetime accomplishments. I am well on my way and consider Brian Tracy to be one of the mentors who has helped me most out.

I have read over a hundred self-help, personal development type books, and this book essentially summarizes all of them. The key in the information age is to find someone who can distill down all the great truths and knowledge into 250 pages or so. This is the great gift. I like some of Anthony Robbbin's material, but Brian's material seems so perfused with professionalism, detail, and thoroughness, I can't help but remember his message."},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"This is the first self improvement book I ever read! I just finished reading it again...Wow! Mr. Tracy does such a fine job of explaining self-motivation/improvement. I've read many of his books, as well as listened to a great majority of his tapes. In my book, he's the best! Other motivational speakers/writers are good: Zig Ziglar, Denis Waitley, Anthony Robbins, Jim Rohn, etc.. Mr. Tracy is just the best, hands down. This is his best book period. Unfortunately, all of his many other books repeat the same techniques--worded differently, so I suppose it wouldn't matter which of Tracy's books you read first. At some point, if Brian Tracy continues to write, I'd like to see him infuse some totally fresh stuff. One thing readers of this genre need to understand, it's the repetition of these very basic concepts which must permeate ones thick skull and make a permanent dent in the old gray matter (I'm speaking from experience). I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their life. One day I hope to meet Brian Tracy and thank him personally for the profound impact he has had on my life.

There are so many of them out there it's hard to know which one to choose. Some are plain bad, a waste of money. But even the good ones usually don't work because all self-help books require you practice and practice. While reading them they seem amazing and then you finish them, put them down and you're back to your old ways.This book won't let you. It is too thought provoking to let you just procrastinate again.It requires a complete change in your way of thinking and gives you the right tools to achieve this change.

I bought copies for all my family last Christmas &amp; have recommended it to all my friends too.My favorite thing it states is that your subconsious mind can't tell if your conscious mind is telling the truth. Ever have a dream so vivid you can't remember if it really happened? If you keep telling yourself you're thin, rich, a non-smoker, or whatever your goal is, eventually your subconsious mind believes it &amp; works to make it happen. Obviously it is not that simple, so go read the book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Achievement","review":"I have been a fan of Brian Tracy for years.

And of course I had to play with it too."},{"Title":"Paper Planes That Soar: Highlights Flight School","review":"This book was supposed to have several different types of planes, but only had one that flew. I would have liked it to have better instructions for a 3rd grader to understand."},{"Title":"Paper Planes That Soar: Highlights Flight School","review":"This book is so much fun and very educational. I am always on the look out for something new and creative for my kids. My 10 year old son was continually asking me how to fold a paper airplane. I would try my best to remember what I did as a kid. Sometimes it would fly and sometimes come crashing down. I was so glad to see this book and surprised at how thick, sturdy and well made it is.Planes that soar, is a fantastic book which starts out by explaining the simple physics of flight and airplanes. Then it offers many different versions of airplanes to fold and fly. The best part is that it has printed paper with tie die, crazy designs, and more. There must be 50 or more sheets for the kids to fold according to the simple instructions and then send soaring around the house or in the yard. The instructions are simple (younger ones might need help). The paper is thick and cool. The information is educational.We also have 6 and 8 year old girls. Everyone in our family has enjoyed folding airplanes, having races and becoming more interested in the planes we see flying overhead from the local airport. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a really neat, interesting, fun, educational gift. I would say the ages are limitless. It's always fun to fly a good well made paper airplane."},{"Title":"Jabber Programming (M&T Books)","review":"Please do not be fooled by title. Less then 1/3 of the book covers Jabber programming itself. Most of book is about ... how to configure Jabber client authors developed (actually about 1/3 of book). Language is very primitive. Development environment is VB 6.0. Absolutely useless book."},{"Title":"Jabber Programming (M&T Books)","review":"First of all, the title here is misleading. There are some snippets walking the reader through Visual Basic code, but the concepts and protocols (JEPs, XMPP, etc.) are noticeably absent. I honestly was able to read the book in a couple of hours (nothing challenging or meaty here) and found it a waste of my time. If you are having trouble installing Jabber clients, this may be a useful resource since the real focus of the book seems to be this very topic. However, the information included is also dated. Here is my recommendation: if you are looking for a decent Jabber book, start with the O'Reilly one."},{"Title":"Osbert Sitwell","review":"Author Philip Ziegler poses the question: Is Osbert Sitwell worth a book? Naturally, having written a superb and colorful biography of a second-rate writer but world class eccentric, his answer is yes. I agree. Osbert is a piece of work -- and a bundle of contradictions. An elitist with kindness and thoughtfulness for all classes of people; a pacifist who liked to be known as Captain Sitwell for his brief stint in a fashionable regiment; an epicure and lover of luxury who was nonetheless broke for much of his life; and a never-quite-in-the-top-rank poet and novelist whose most enduring work is his autobiography. Ziegler's biography is meticulously researched and documented; fluent, witty and affectionate."},{"Title":"Osbert Sitwell","review":"Osbert Sitwell, in many ways, could be considered a dreadful man: irascible and litigious, snobbish and bigoted, a W.C. Fieldsian hater of dogs and kids, even a sometime admirer of Italian Fascism. Philip Ziegler's biography notes Sitwell's glaring faults, but also his shining virtues, so that in the end Sitwell appears profoundly sympathetic, even lovable. He was accused throughout his life of being an aristocratic dilettante, yet in the end he produced more than 50 books, including some of the most vivid memoirs and art criticism of any English author. He was notably quarrelsome--as were his siblings Edith and Sacheverell--yet to family and friends he showed touching loyalty and generosity. Osbert Sitwell was one of the biggest fish in the big pond that was English literary society between the wars, and Ziegler does a brilliant job not only of portraying that society but of delineating Sitwell's significance in it--both as an individual and as a member of the brilliant, outrageous Sitwell family."},{"Title":"Osbert Sitwell","review":"Why do I keep thinking this book could have been more lucid, organized better, more telling? I agree with all the previous reviewers here -- it is a good book, and at the end one knows more about the Sitwells than at the begining, and yes, comes to like Osbert. I don't know about admiring his work, though. I'd have appreciated some examples of the prose, especially some excerpts from the autobiography volumes.But I kept wanting a clearer picture. There could have been more details about his various relationships; the progress through his life could have been more linear, I'd have liked to know more about the creation of his works, from the writing to the publishing.Apparently Osbert and Edith were respected in the literary community, or parts of it. I'd have liked to know more about that. Ziegler did make it clear at the end that with time Joyce, Eliot, Woolf, Lawrence etc., were elevated to the status of classic writers, while Osbert is now pretty much unknown and obscure. What accounted for his big impact at the time?Well, lots of things to ponder -- so well worth reading."},{"Title":"Osbert Sitwell","review":"Philip Ziegler's Osbert Sitwell provides a new biography of the poet and novelist, surveying the Sitwell family and the literary temperament of the times which influenced and formed his life.

And in this, Jay Prosser tells us, we find the gift of photography.Engaging the photographic reflections of figures as different as Roland Barthes and Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Gordon Parks and Elizabeth Bishop, Light in the Dark Room offers a vision of photography as realization of loss-and a revelation of how photographs can shed light on the dark rooms of our lives. The grief this book recalls is poignant yet universal: a son loses his mother; an anthropologist, his culture; a photographer, his youth; a poet, her lover. Among these losses and the remarkable photographs that accompany them, Prosser weaves his own meditations on photography, on the interdependence of loss and enlightenment, on the emergence of our technologized society-and the world we have lost in the process.Excerpt: We treat photographs as if they had a kind of presence. Photography is the commonest way for us to record our own and our loved ones' lives. And we arrange photographs in our rooms of our beloved, often because they cannot be with us there-often (and eventually) because they are dead. Photography is the medium in which we unconsciously encounter the dead. Yet herein lies photography's hidden truth. Photographs are not signs of presence but evidence of absence. Or rather the presence of a photo-graph indicates its subject's absence. Photographs contain a realization of loss. This book on photography enters into that loss.\\""},{"Title":"Coin Collector's Price Guide","review":"I would recommend this selection to any coin collector.

Hersey worked for Sinclair Lewis and his mentor's style is obvious. It is done in the same rather superficial narrative style.as Lewis' works. Admittedly, I like a novel with psychological, spiritual and symbolic aspects. A Bell for Adano does have the the overly obvious symbolism of the connection to our Liberty Bell. Basically this is a propaganda piece for W.W.II. It did have over 20 printings in a short period of time which brings to mind the expression that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American and, in this case, also British people. Despite its triteness and thin literary veneer it is an easy read suitable for an airplane ride and a 9th grade English class."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This book was o.k. for a book report or panel discussion.

Major Joppolo is assigned to be the administrative head of the newly-captured town of Adano. He has to face crisis after crisis and deal with all sorts of people--both Italian and American--in order to get things running again. He falls in love with a local girl and incurs the enmity of an arrogant American general. To gather the town's spirit, so much damaged by the war, he tries to get a bell to replace the one melted down by the Fascists. A BELL FOR ADANO is basically a series of vignettes centered around this story, not a tale of personality transformation. The good guys remain good, but bad guys will be bad.Hersey presents his story in a very nave style, similar to Saroyan at the same period. It was a morale-boosting effort, self-praising by Americans to tell themselves \\"this is what we stand for, this is what we are fighting for\\". It was a moment in history when Americans believed they had something very special to offer the world. The American way, democratic and hardworking, is contrasted to whatever existed in Sicily before. Even if there's army-navy rivalry, if there are bad apples among the Americans, the newly-arrived victors mean well. The American characters are rough and smooth, good and bad, but nothing is very philosophical or psychologically deep. The characters are all pretty thin. Some parts seemed very sappy to me with their \\"sweet\\" Italian characters, most of whom came from some stockbook of stereotypes.Fifteen years after Hersey wrote this novel (which was a great success at the time), \\"The Ugly American\\" tried to show a similar thing---that we have a lot to offer the world, but we are our own worst enemies. After another half century---how many invasions more ?--- today we are perhaps a bit wiser, a little more cynical. The American occupation of Sicily is an interesting bit of world history, but our approach to the period has changed over 65 years, and it would be hard to convince most contemporary readers that we are so benign. That's why I would say that this is a book that has not stood the test of time very well. It may have made Americans proud in those days of world war, but I think three stars are more than sufficient today."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"Back in high school, I made a vow to myself that I would eventually read all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels. A Bell for Adano was one of the first that I read. Now, a few years later, I have read around 30 of those novels, and while many have been wonderful, few have matched the experience of reading A Bell for Adano, and I continue to return to it.The splendid novel is set during World War II, though it isn't really a war novel. The novel is about how very different people can, and should treat one another, especially when in a difficult situation. A Bell for Adano primarily concerns Major Joppolo. He is an American officer placed in charge of the city of Adano after the invasion. Joppolo is a wonderful, though flawed man. He's always practical but remains sentimental. He sets out to make the lives of the people of Adano the best he possibly can. He does so by not treating them as the enemy but as People. The &quot;bell&quot; of Adano refers his attempt to restore an historic bell to the city that it had lost during the war.I can never do justice to my favorite novels when I review them, and this is one of them. I can't say enough good about it. The characterizations are strong and the interactions between the characters are touching and thought-provoking. Joppolo's relationship to the city's people is truly remarkable. It makes one think about America's relationship with foreign countries. The story is heart-tugging and humorous. There are few novels written this century that can touch a reader as much as this one does, and this one can make you think a little, too. A Bell for Adano certainly deserved its prize, and it definitely deserves to not be forgotten."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"John Hersey would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize and become a prominent star in the pantheon of twentieth century writers. This book was written during World War II and was a best-seller when released in 1944. And it still resonates today. In short, it is the story of an American officer given civil responsibility for overseeing the coastal Italian town of Adano following its liberation by American forces.How Major Victor Joppolo goes about this task is interesting as are the variety of Italians-former fascists and anti-fascists alike--he meets and, eventually, wins over. More gripping, though, is the character of Jappolo himself who, in many ways, Hersey repressents as Everyman--or at least EveryAmercicanman. He is practical, yet sentimental. He wants to do good, but also wants to be loved. He has a strong sense of loyalty, yet hungers after an Italian woman despite loving his wife back home. He admires the Italians, but shapes them in our American mold. He is--in modern psychobabble--conflicted; imperfect, yet very admirable.The title refers to the city's most prominent--it has dozens of them--bell which for seven hundred years called the people to work, to eat, to love, to church, to life. It was shipped away by the retreating Germans to be made into bullets at some northern foundry. Its lack leaves a gaping wound in the civic fabric. Joppolo, of course, gets the town a replacement bell. How he does it fills you with pride. His first hearing of its strong voice can break your heart. This is a worthwhile book both as a story and as a still provocative look at the American character."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"My head read this book and said: &quot;If only Iraq were this easy. The Americans invade Sicily in World War II and Major Joppolo is put in charge of the small town of Adano. Despite the grisly casualties in the taking of the town, the whole place falls instantly in love with the American major. And what about those ethnic stereotypes? The Sicilians all seem like goodhearted but slightly retarded children, an impression reinforced by their comical dialogue, both when they speak English (&quot;Okay, a boss, you're a not a kid Giuseppe&quot;) and in literal translation, when they speak their native language (so &quot;Viva il Signor Capitano!&quot; becomes &quot;Live the Mr. Captain!&quot;). Sicilians who were there during the war say it was not this way at all: the Americans installed members of the mafia as mayors to keep the Sicilians under control.&quot;My heart, who also read the book, replied: &quot;You just don't understand. This is a beautiful tale about how a single individual can make a difference. Two vastly different worlds collide, but the result is pure magic because Major Joppolo throws the rule book away and reaches out to the town with his heart, inventing novel solutions to problems, trying to get a replacement for the bell that the Germans stole, and, above all, connecting with the people. The humor is marvelous: The scene in which the priest holds an interminable church service waiting for the major, who promised to attend but who has lost track of the time, will guarantee at least one chuckle. And Hersey choreographed the poignant scene when the Italian prisoners of war come home to their women as pure ballet.&quot;In the end my heart prevailed when my head remembered that Aristotle said that the purpose of drama was not to represent reality, but to effect &quot;a catharsis of pity and fear.&quot; This book will do more than that: it will make you smile, and it will make you feel a little better about the human race."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"As another reader has said, I also am making my way through Pulitzer winners. I'd intended to save this one until the end, because for some reason I was under the (much mistaken) impression that it was going to be boring. Boy, shows you first impressions aren't always right! This is a heartwarming and yet bittersweet story - you wish there were more people out there like the Major and less people like the General, and the types they represent. I read the novel in about three hours; it's that compelling and ultimately enriching. I'm glad I didn't wait!"},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"A Bell For Adano is heart-warming story set in an otherwise horrific period of history.Illustrating the charm of an American soldier and the filling of the voids in a war-ravaged Italian town, Hersey makes you smile and beg for more. While the tone is ethnocentric in its portrayal of the Italian vision of the Americans, A Bell for Adano is a read that I emphatically recommend."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"A great story and great dialogue. This is a well constructed book that has great characters and great imagery but also manages to keep the story moving along. While i am sure my enjoyment was enhanced because i read it while in Italy, I would have enjoyed reading this anywhere. It is a great portrait of small town Italy and of people.It is also interesting in this story of the US liberation of Italy, that it was written in the mid-1940s and has a thinly-veiled very negative portrayl of General Patton."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"I read this back in High School in the sixties. I recently saw the movie and remarked how I did not remember much of anything about it, so I got the book and read it. It is an easy read and quite entertaining. The movie is excellent but the book is outstanding. It is charming, warm and real. It demonstrates that in this world we have bureaucrats and politicians out for themselves (like Gen. Marvin.) We have people who want to do better but cannot because they are jaded(Borth, Purvis). And fortunately we have some Jopollos who are kind and caring. Too bad there are not many of them in leadership. They are lacking even in the church but there are notable exceptions. I recommend this to anyone looking to read soemthing inspirational to life them out of the doldrums. I had read Hiroshima and that seems to get more attention than this work. This is a thoroughly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"I loved this book. I will admit that I'm a fan of the 1940s, both movies and books. However, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel transcends all that -- it's simply a fine story. Even though the theme is World War II, this is not a story of battle. Instead, it's about a compassionate major and his attempts to bring humanity to a war-torn town in Italy. The books is funny, charming and moving. It's a quick read and a worthwhile one. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"I read this book because I was reading all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels.

Set in Adano, Italy during WWII, it gives the reader a sense of another point of view of the war. The townspeople and the situations are hilarious, you'll laugh the whole way through. Keep this in mind, but keep some tissues nearby."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This a truly outstanding story. It can be enjoyed on many levels. Most obviously, it is wonderfully refreshing in showing American soldiers at their jobs -- winning a war and improving the lives of their former adversaries. It is also a poignantly understated love story. It is also a humorous and brilliant study in how organizations work, including the countless ways that underlings attempt to undermine \\"orders\\" from the top. It is also a true-to-life tale about the many ways an American occupation of a foreign country can go disastrously wrong, though in Adano disaster is narrowly averted over and again. The writing style is beautiful and spare.Adult themes are treated with good taste. This treatment makes them all the more powerful in the story.Not so long ago, Adano was a common fixture on school reading lists. The general lack of comments from students here on Amazon confirms my impression that schools are not teaching Adano much these days. That's a shame. Adano is a vastly better work than the politically correct tripe that so many schools dish out (a very partial list: My Brother Sam is Dead; Farewell to Manzanar; The House on Mango Street; The Bomb; The Slave Dancer). If you are home schooling, note that Adano won the Pulitzer Prize and is a proper substitute for almost any book that appears on current \\"recommended\\" lists."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"Have heard this title for years and finally decided to read it.

It is not only a heart-warming story, but a realistic portrayal of the best of America's soldiers not only in fighting during World War II, but also in carefully rebuilding nations. This well-crafted novel also offers a civics lesson, so desperately needed today, about the wonder of democracy and ethical leadership, especially to the people of the small Italian village of Adano, who have suffered so long under a totalitarian regime. Hersey takes readers on a bittersweet, yet hopeful journey as his humble hero struggles against the entrenched corruption of the former fascist regime and the incompetence of his own military bureaucracy to convince the people of Adano that in a democratic society they may decide their own destiny. Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading the finest American literature."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This book has been on my mind a lot since I read it.

A must read."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"I read John Hersey's The Child Buyer in college and enjoyed a spirited discussion of it with a professor. Now I remember nothing about it, but I've wanted to read another Hersey novel every since. Written in 1944 about the Allied occupation of a coastal Italian town, the Pulitzer winner A Bell for Adano is surprisingly funny at times. Obviously Hersey is making a patriotic point and a plug for democracy with his American hero Major Victor Joppolo, whose fairness and good will contrast sharply with the corruption of the former Nazi regime. His real nemesis, though, is General Marvin--the type of bad-tempered American whose behavior Joppolo is continually having to apologize for. Joppolo has his hands full as he tries to fulfill basic needs like food and water, but he also wants to restore morale. One of his big tasks in this latter regard is to find a replacement for the town's bell, which was confiscated by the Nazis to be melted down into ammunition. Quirky Italian characters abound, from the head fisherman who refuses to set foot in a government office, to the town crier, who likes to put his own spin on proclamations. I haven't had this much fun reading about the military since I read Joseph Heller's Catch-22, which was a much more challenging read. Unlike Revolutionary Road, I think that this book has held up well over time."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This book is wonderful in its clear language and soft touch. You will instantly feel a part of the town and its inhabitants. The book tells the story of a small town in Italy occupied by the Americans at the end of WW2. It relates how the occupied village interacts with its human, caring &quot;occupier&quot;, an American army officer. Much like Corelli's Mandolin by Louis de Bernieres, this book puts a massive event in world history into focus. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This is John Hersey's wonderful \\"feel good\\" novel set in Italy during WW II. Major Victor Joppolo has been assigned senior civil affairs officer of the allied occupied town of Adano. Joppolo, an Italian-American, is a good man who only wants to do what is best for the town. He befriends the town's citizens, determines their needs, and tries to accommodate them. In addition to the major concern of getting the people fed, he learns that the town once had a bell that was rung every quarter-hour until Mussolini had it removed to be melted down for ammunition. Joppolo goes on a mission to get the bell back or replaced somehow.Of course there must be a black hat countering Joppolo's every good move, and that person is General Marvin, the dictatorial, self-important, and ultimately destructive Commander-in-Chief - obviously based on Gen. George Patton. Joppolo is willing to bend and even subvert orders to accomplish what he perceives his task to be: to bring order, decency, and democracy to the war-torn and defeated town. He succeeds marvelously, despite Marvin's interference, and receives the praises of all the Italian civilians he deals with (sometimes this is overdone just a wee bit). Hersey's Italian characters are warm and very human; especially good are the proud fisherman Tomasino and Joppolo's interpreter Giuseppe. Hersey based his novel on a short article he'd written for LIFE magazine, which told of a visit he'd made to the American military governor at Licata, Italy, in 1943. The book is entertaining and life-affirming - interesting for a war novel."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"another 5 star vote for a great book.

Thanks for your support..."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"In early 1944, the United States of America was completely engaged in World War II. Although national confidence and resolve were high that America would win the war, there were still many months of hard, costly fighting ahead. Most Americans supported the war effort, and considered the conflict to be justified, although the desire that it be over was virtually universal. Nonetheless, some Americans may have questioned why the U.S. was even involved in what to them seemed to be a \\"European\\" war, or a war in Asian theaters which many people had never even heard of.John Hersey was a war correspondent. Released in February, 1944, his work, \\"A Bell for Adano,\\" was a fictional creation based on his own experiences and observations during the war. In it, he tells in a simple, often humorous manner the story of U.S. Army Major Victor Joppolo, the son of immigrants, who is assigned the task of governing a small Italian town during its American occupation. In doing so, Hersey portrays everything America -- and Americans -- were fighting for in the war: to make the world a better place through democracy. Early in the book, in an address to the towns officials, Joppolo tries to explain to them that it is their job to serve the community, not master it. \\"What makes a man master of another man?\\" he asks. \\"It is that he pays him for his work. Who pays the men in the government? The people do, for they pay the taxes . . . \\"In telling the story of Joppolo and the town of Adano, Hersey gives the reader a glimpse into the characters and personalities of typical American servicemen. Some are admirable, such as the Navy's Lieutenant Livingston. Some are honest but flawed, such as the military police commander, Captain Purvis. Some are difficult to embrace, such as General Marvin. One of the strengths of this work is that Hersey did not put make-up over their warts and flaws, but allows the reader to see their shortcomings. It is one of the more subtle aspects of the moral that the American system of democracy works despite the Americans themselves.As the United States now moves well into the 21st Century, it is more than worth a gaze back to 1944, to use that glimpse to try and determine if we are still on a course our grand-parents and great-grand-parents would approve. This, for me, is the true contemporary value of the 1945 Pulitzer winner, and why it is still a worthwhile and relevant read nearly 75 years after its release.\\"A Bell for Adano\\" is a delightful and quick read that will linger in your thoughts long after you have closed the back cover. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"This Pulitzer Prize-winning tale recounts the experiences of Major Victor Joppolo, an Italian-American officer put in charge of administering the American-occupied village of Adano, Italy in the final days of WWII. Joppolo's ostensible mission is to rebuild the village's infrastructure in the wake of the war and the toll exacted by decades of facist rule. However, Joppolo understands that he has been charged with a less tangible but even more important duty: to demonstrate the advantages of American governance, justice, and empathy and win over the hearts/minds of the townspeople. To this end, he devotes himself to locating a replacement for a beloved and deeply-mourned town bell looted by the facists. I admit I quickly fell in love with Hersey's beguiling characters, his courtly prose, and his gentle but penetrating eye for irony.It is easy - perhaps too easy - to label the author's depiction of characters in the novel as stereotypical, and his depiction of Joppolo's attitude towards the citizens of Adano as condescending and paternalistic. At least part of the problem is that the charm of Hersey's prose tends to mask the extent to which his characters embody both virtue and vice. Joppolo's aide-de-camp cleverly humiliates a former facist official up to no good, but his intentions towards the women in the town are unabashedly crude. General Martin delights in liberating Italy from wicked facists, but thinks nothing of brutally slaughtering a donkey belonging to a peasant, simply because he has the temerity to get in his way. Even the actions of Joppolo are depicted as a recognizably human balance between idealism (believing in the superiority of the \\"American Way\\") and vanity (wanting to win the love/admiration of the townspeople), loyalty (to his country) and disloyalty (to his wife).In short, I believe that perceived anachronisms in this tale may accurately represent actual anachronisms that existed at this fascinating moment in U.S. history. It was a time when average villagers in small rural European towns genuinely were unsophisticated, when America genuinely did feel a paternalistic responsibility towards the rest of the world; a time when Americans embraced cultural stereotypes as a way of celebrating their country's diversity, and when American servicemen saw nothing hypocritical in idealizing their wives while simultaneously seeking the physical solace of foreign damsels. Hersey's gift is helping us to see how these anachronisms have shaped (and continue to shape) the way the world has come to view Americans, and the way we have come to view ourselves."},{"Title":"A Bell For Adano","review":"At first I was thinking, this is Pulitzer prize winning novel? Please.But on second thought, A Bell for Adano has a lot of wonderful qualities.Thematically the novel is very rich and unapologetically honest. It deals with the theme of authority, and the consequences of going against authority. Even though the Americans have arrived to Adano after the fall of Mussolini to try to usher in democracy, the reader discovers quickly that, in some instances, the Americans with their democracy are sometimes no better than Mussolini and his Fascism. In many instances, some of the American and British characters are insensitive to Italian culture, and make no effort to even understand the people and their way of life. The indifference and bureaucracy displayed by Mussolini's government is also infuriatingly rampant among the American Army and Navy occupying Adano.Many of the scenes were so endearing I had make myself slow down to enjoy them all the more. They were artfully done. Using quick and sharp dialogue, Hersey managed to capture the nuances of everyday life in this Italian town.But when I finished, I was sort of thinking, this is it? This novel is basically about a man, Major Jappolo, who runs the small Sicilian town of Adano during WWII. His long-term goal is to get the town a new bell. Other than that, he helps these people recover their life after years of a miserable existence under the rule of Mussolini. That's all great ... but there didn't seem to be much of a STORY.The character development of the protagonist felt a little thin to me. His character was the same throughout the novel. Not a major problem, but had their been some growth on the part of his character, the novel could have been richer.So, while A Bell for Adano had many great qualities, when you put it all together it still left me rather lukewarm."},{"Title":"Playboy January 2002 Chyna Joanie Laurer Holiday Anniversary Issue","review":"Magazine was arousing.Magazine arrived in a very timely fashion.Magazine arrived in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Something Wonderful","review":"Poor Little Hen.

I just couldn't get the first image I had of the hero out of my mind and, believe me, it wasn't an image I wanted to have etched there permanently. I think an author has to be careful when describing her characters to her audience. In this case, she was describing Brian Boru as this huge man sitting in a chair ordering people to get things for him and all I could think of was JABBA the HUTT in Star Wars. She made him sound so enormous and being barely able to move. And it sounded like he was about eighty-five years old. I really had trouble seeing him as a romantic lead. I know he suffered for his country and all, but come on, it's a romance. After all, it was just one knee wasn't it. Surely he didn't have to hobble like he did. As for Nichola, she was horrendous. She was just plain flighty and stupid. Wanting to be a soldier. And talk about easy. THis was a very advanced for its time school for girls. Like I said, I really had to push to finish this book. I'm not even going to donate this one to the library. I will try to unload it at my yard sale."},{"Title":"School for Scandal: How to Kiss a Hero","review":"Romancing the Celtic Soul says... Ms Hingston's delightful tale, HOW TO KISS A HERO, is sure to add a breath of fresh air to the current offerings in Regency period historicals. I was delighted to see how well developed the cast of characters were for a Regency. Readers will clamor for more tales from the School for Scandal as Gwen, and Elizabeth must have there own stories. In like fashion, readers will want to know if there is a hero for the sullen but waspish Lady Katherine as well.Although the story takes place entirely in England, there are many delightful references to Scotland. Lady Meagan Boru is a wonderful comic addition, butlers beware! Even the dour Scottish valet adds an element of suspense that will catch the readers by surprise. Ms. Hingston has proven time and again, with her unique talent at creating well developed stories, that the Regency period need not be boring nor predictable to be fun.

The words seem to reach out of the page and embrace you, and the author makes you care about the characters, and yet it still maintained a light and humorous tone.The story, incidentally, is about a young woman named Nicole, whose critical mother drops her off at a debutant farm to learn how to be a &quot;lady.&quot; Unfortunately, Nicole is hopeless. However, she does find joy in her daily fencing lessons. Eventually, the school hires a rather infamous war hero (&quot;Bullocksing Brown,&quot; I believe it was)to teach her the finer points of sword play, and things generally progress from those phallic symbols and onward, until Nicole's younger brother gets wind of the affair, and then the fur begins to fly!The end was a little murky, not to mention blaringly unrealistic (I thought the main characters' reunion would have been more poignant had it come about without all the kidnapping, etc.), but I still list this book as one of my favorites.

Nichola, however, has no intention of entering the &quot;marriage market&quot;. She realizes that a girl like her, taller than most and only attractive, rather than beautiful, would not exactly be &quot;sought after&quot; by eligible bachelors. Most importantly, Nichola is too intelligent to subject herself to one of the loveless marriages which are so common among her peers. Instead, Nichola wishes to do something important and useful with her life. A true tomboy, she plans to follow the example of her older brothers, and run off to join England's army and fight Napoleon.However, the Baroness Hainesworth has other ideas for her only daughter. She wishes Nichola to marry, and to marry well. To that end, the Baroness enrolls Nichola in Mrs. Treadwell's Academy for Young Ladies. What the Baroness does not know is that while Mrs. Treadwell's does indeed teach young ladies the &quot;gentle arts&quot;, it also strives to help them discover their true selves by allowing them to pursue other subjects not usually taught to young ladies. Some of the students find fulfillment in the sciences, and some in literature. The athletic Nichola develops a passion for fencing. Soon, Nichola's skill surpasses that of her fencing instructor, the scandalous Countess d'Oliveri, who is Mrs. Treadwell's silent partner in the Academy.Enter Lord Brian Boru. Nichola first encounters Lord Boru at a ball, where she spies the imposing Scotsman lounging indolently in a chair, ordering servants to perform the most mean tasks for him. He is exactly what Nichola despises in the ton, and she wastes no time in letting Lord Boru know what she thinks of him. To her mortification, Nichola later learns that the reason for Lord Boru's lethargy is not laziness, but a crippling war wound. She attempts to apologize at a later meeting with him but is rebuffed, perhaps because Lord Boru dislikes himself as much as Nichola does. Nichola is surprised when Lord Boru, who is a friend of the Countess, appears at the Academy as her new fencing instructor. However, she is intrigued by his considerable fencing skill, and as time goes on, intrigued by the man. As their lessons continue, Nichola and Lord Boru fall in love...The two lead characters in this book were enchanting. Nichola and Lord Boru are real people - attractive, passionate, emotional, and even have some flaws. I loved that they weren't the usual perfect gods and goddesses that some leads in romance novels can be. Also, I enjoyed the way their love affair helped them to change and grow. In one touching scene, Nichola looks in a mirror after a lesson with Lord Boru, and for the first time, sees herself as a beautiful woman. And it is truly gratifying to see the way that Lord Boru regains his self respect, through his relationship with Nichola.I have two small quibbles with the book. Although the story was original and interesting up to the commencement of Nichola and Lord Boru's love affair, it ventured into usual Regency fare after that (apparently a lot of women were kidnapped during this era). Also, the narrative was jumpy in some spots, and I had to re-read a few scenes to figure out exactly what was happening (even during a major love scene!).

Also the additional characters were rather flat. The scandalous Countess, the society matron, the harridan mother(Nichola's), the concerned brother, they could have been more developed.

He definitely is a 'tortured hero', but one whose self pity never takes away from his 'hero' qualities.The scenes between Nicola and Brian develop gradually from antagonism, into mutual admiration, into incredibly sexy scenes.Other inhabitants from the school, as well as Nicola's family, Brian's aide, are entertaining secondary characters.This was not a 'keeper' due to some unlikely scenes in the book. The ending was particularly weak, for me, due to a kidnapping along with the arrival of Nicola's twin, and her mother's reappearance. However, it was well worth my time and money.

Evelyn is unhappy with the match because Vanessa has turned into another society matron. Evelyn blames herself as she taught Vanessa to flirt instead of preparing her for life. When Christiane suggests they take advantage of Evelyn's reputation by opening up a school to teach young ladies about real life, Evelyn agrees. Thus, Mrs. Evelyn Treadwell's Academy for Young Ladies opens.Nicola Hainesworth is a tomboy whose desperate mother sends her packing to the Treadwell School. Surprisingly, Nicola enjoys the place, especially when Christiane provides her with fencing lessons. Her fencing skills quickly become superior to her instructor, so the school hires crippled war hero Lord Brian Boruo to further her skills. As they fence with swords, Nicola and Brian also duel with their hearts. He relishes her passion to fence. His feelings quickly turns to love. She reciprocates his emotion. Though, the honorable Brian would never foster a cripple like himself on a member of the Ton, he never factored in that Nicola always flaunted the rules. She also has been trained to live life to the fullest, and that means Brian.HOW TO KISS A HERO is an interesting Regency romance due to the secondary characters.

Modern kids aren't awfully familiar with life at sea, and certainly no one my children knew could set out into the world in order to search for a friend who had left home. Ardizzone's locales and situations manage to seem exotic, yet totally reasonable. We were pulled into this story.

The Academy library)","review":"Aged 80, already ill, Henri Bergson (1859-1941) went downstairs to the street (in his slippers and a sleep skirt) to underwrite a Nazi-registration-form, that he was one of the so called unworthy living creatures, a Jew, having no rights, being discharged, honourless, defenseless, unprotected. When in the \\"Etat Francais\\" also a Jew statute had been announced, the French government had offered an exception treatment to Bergson, that famous citizen of Jewish birth. However professor Bergson refused receiving such a gift from such hand. 1920, on the occasion of the establishment of the United Nations, Henri Bergson had been a first president of the commission for mental co-operation (when times were to be called still worthy to human beings). 1927 he had received the Nobelprize of literature regarding to his main-publication \\"Creative Evolution\\". At the end of his life the public ethic level had been fallen down immeasurably deep. Commissions for \\"mental co-operation\\" (1920) evidently had disappeared and instead had been replaced by tanks, execution committees, gasification camps and other genocide methods. The esteem of an human being you cannot measure exactly via empiric sciences (i.e. Nazi biological race sciences). An anthropology of such a bedeviled horizon of course fails his subject. The risk of every empiric, specialized science (i.e. psychology, social and political sciences) is to underestimate human beings via shortened views, operating with the handicap of false subtle ideologies, conceptions, definitions - and the practice to analyze only a small section of time. To seize the \\"life melody\\" of a human being, it is not sufficient to emerge ridiculously only one or two notes. The entire \\"SPAN\\", if possible from the birth to the end of a biography, - only such a span (the complete melody, not a single note) is able to illuminate the secret of a human personality to a sympathizing viewer. Only via this method you can discover the dynamics, movements, changing spirals, the will to carry through, the persistent believe at the own worth of a person - even if the social associates have lost such a horizon long time ago. Bergson's father had been a music teacher and a composer - considering this fact, the idea of talking metaphorically about \\"single notes\\" and a complete \\"life-melody\\" touches the heart. The upcoming of the psychoanalytic theory of Sigmund Freud surely inspired Bergson - and though there are some mad, too punctual views in this Vienna theories: this specialized science delivered a plenty of hypotheses better than the usual biological ones. Otherwise Bergson inspired a lot of novelists: Marcel Proust or James Joyce, Sartre (his writings about Flaubert) or Nikos Kazantzakis' movie \\"Alexis Sorbas\\" (featuring Anthony Quinn as the pure embodiment of \\"elan vital\\"). Erik H. Erikson with his innovative book \\"Identity and life cycle\\" also is one of the innumerable researchers, who developed knowledge into this advanced direction: the concept of duration, of showing a complete life-melody. A quotation out of a lecture held 1911 by Bergson at the university of Oxford: \\"Via philosophy we can get accustomed, never to isolate the present from the past. Via philosophy all things gain a depth of field, something like a fourth dimension, which permits to associate the earlier perceptions with the present.\\" In the title of Bergson's book \\"Creative Evolution\\" the nature of this unusual human is as crystallizing as in that delivered gesture, underwriting the Nazi-registration-form, just as the inhumanity of German occupiers required. Surely none of them understood the nonchalant irony of this doing (in the spirit of a mind, which never loses a sort of a \\"BIRDS VIEW\\").

The Academy library)","review":"Bergson, all the rage in the early 1900's, has now been rediscovered,thanks in part to the work of Deleuze et al. Time and Free Will is a great exemplar of Bergson's work and his idea of the duree and the spatialization of time. Bergson presents to the reader an energetic flux which is the precondition of our more vulgar concept of time. With this flux, the past is pulled along by the future and presented to consciousness in the present as a heterogeneous conglomeration, inseperable and uncategorizable. It is this work which inspired the stream of consciousness novelists, especially Proust. But the most remarkable element of Time and Free Will is its demand on the reader to live the duree, to return to the duree and forget oneself in it. The goal is freedom and authenticity and this can only be achieved when letting oneself go, flying like a bird, and despatializing time. This book does not only open the door to phenomenology, but it also contributes in a significant way to french existentialist thought."},{"Title":"Time and free will,: An essay on the immediate data of consciousness (Harper torchbooks. The Academy library)","review":"Bergson's works are always inspirational and the remarkable thing is that he doesn't assume anything he always explains what is needed (almost always) unlike the standard treatises on philosophy by other philosophers. It is never that much of an effort to read Bergson and as such it makes his works far more accessible than usual for a philosopher, probably one of the reasons he was all the rage in the early 20th Century, people can actually understand what he was talking about. What is the reason for this ? I think much of it has to do with his unwillingness to separate his insights into distinct pieces as is the norm in philosophy. His essays tend to flow along nicely without being stuck in difficult terminology which must be remembered as you progress, anything such as the word duration which has a special significance in Bergson work becomes part of the flow of the essay rather than being in any way special it is always reinforced through the dialogue. Another interesting aspect is his lack of references to others, possibly a result of the French way of Education which encourages self reliance and expression as much as possible.In this work, one of his earliest (1887), Bergson introduces his concept of duration which is less of a concept than a real lived sense that is happening in your life right at this moment. But first he introduces the reader to the intensities of psychic states such as beauty, grace, joy, sorrow, pain etc and how a misinterpretation of real lived experience gives rise to a way of philosophy which separates real duration as it is experienced into space-like time, this is also evident in feelings which are modified through the space-like construction of experience. Although this first chapter fails to convince once you proceed onto the construction of the idea of duration you feel on much safer ground, one feels Bergson has seriously studied this phenomenon, not of course just in thought or conceptualisation but, in his own lived experience present at every moment. He goes on to explain the falseness of the spacialisation of time which inevitably leads to the paradoxes of Zeno in ancient days and determinism with its lack of human freedom. He overcomes the usual arguments of determinism by simply just not defining freedom or its prior conditions since this would once again introduce determinism and spacialise duration.Bergson's work is simply highly insightful of the human condition far more than any dry attempt at it through the usual approaches such as Descarte's or Kant's. He literally lives his work using his own experience to enliven it, I mean literally enliven it, Bergson's work is living in a sense. It is less an argument than a movement through your own feelings and intuitions which then allow you to understand what he is saying, it isn't difficult concepts you can't wrap yourself round. It does occasionally suffer from a lack of clarity wich is an advantage other philosophers have over him but a careful reading will help.Superb as always."},{"Title":"Time and free will,: An essay on the immediate data of consciousness (Harper torchbooks.

The Academy library)","review":"There are a lot of reviews here complaining about the edition. Unfortunately amazon tends to lump all editions together so I would just like to say that the negative reviews do not apply to the Dover edition (the edition with the blue cover and the profile picture of Bergson on it). I would highly recommend buying the Dover edition. I have read it twice and I did not encounter a single error either time through. It is also quite cheap.The book itself is really excellent. Bergson was one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth-century but he does not seem to have the stature today that he once had. I think there are probably a few reasons for that (the dominance of phenomenology in the Continental tradition and language analysis and symbolic logic in the analytic tradition, as well as the fact that Bergson tied some of his ideas to biological theories of his own time which have not held up well). There has been a resurgence of interest in Bergson to some degree which I think is at least partly due to Bergson's undoubted influence on Gilles Deleuze whose star is currently rising. Bergson had a tremendous influence on a whole host of important Continental philosophers (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas, Deleuze, etc.) so, if for no other reason, he is worth reading as necessary background to those thinkers.I happen to think that Bergson is worth studying in his own right and not just in terms of the influence he had on later philosophers. Bergson's primary preoccupation was with the nature of time and no one (including, I think, Husserl and Heidegger) spent as much time thinking about time as Bergson did. The nature of time is one of the most interesting, but also one of the most difficult, topics within metaphysics and Bergson had some very important things to say about it.In Time and Free Will Bergson attempts to defend the notion of free will by arguing that the standard critiques of free will (as well as the standard defense) rely on an inadequate notion of time. It is impossible to summarize Bergson's subtle argument in an amazon review but, basically, the critics (and defenders) of free will have tended to understand time as a homogenous medium like space. Bergson believes that space is the only homogenous medium and that time is pure heterogeneity. The reason for that is that each moment includes the previous moment as a part of its past so that each new moment is totally new. Since no two moments can ever be exactly alike it is impossible to predict the future (the predictions of science, for example, rely on an identity between initial conditions which Bergson, due to his understanding of time, believes is impossible in the life of consciousness).This is not only an inadequate summary of Bergson's central argument in this book it also fails utterly to get at the true value of this book. What makes this book so valuable and exciting is not necessarily its central thesis but the brilliant analysis of time and the life of consciousness that Bergson provides. I believe that philosophy is inherently a method for making distinctions that ordinary consciousness tends to pass over. Bergson's brilliance lies in the way in which he dissects our ordinary experience of ourselves and reveals the ways in which our standard understanding of ourselves is in fact a misunderstanding. Bergson reveals the life of consciousness operating beneath the distortions of language and conceptual understanding. There is a reason why modernist writers like Marcel Proust, who were attempting to describe the life of consciousness or experience in their works, found Bergson to be such an inspiration.While Bergson's central argument is certainly interesting and important what is most important are the ways in which Bergson's analysis will completely change the way the reader understands themselves.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Risk, Ambiguity and Decision (Studies in Philosophy)","review":"Ellsberg does an excellent job of demonstrating the very special nature of the Ramsey-de Finetti-Savage(RFS) subjectivist approach to both probability and decision making.The RFS approach requires the decision maker to be able to specify precise,exact,definite single number answers for all probability estimates.This is supposedly accomplished by an elicitation procedure based on the requirement that every decision is to be modeled as if it were a betting situation.Ellsberg shows that many decision makers will not accept such a betting quotients modeling approach to specifying numerical probabilities because such individuals make imprecise probability assessments.These estimates of probability are intervals.Each interval is made up of a lower probability and an upper probability.Only in the special case where the lower probability equals the upper probability will the RFS approach be sound.Ellsberg makes it very clear that he is building on the work of Good,Koopman,Smith and others in emphasizing the importance of intervals in specifying probability assessments in real world situations.However,in his formal model Ellsberg uses sets of probability distributions.One of Ellsberg's contributions is in terms of explaining why the vast majority of decision makers rely on intervals and not on precise probability estimates.Ellsberg's answer is that both the quantity and quality of relevant information, data or knowledge is ambiguous ,unclear,conflicting,incomplete or not available.Ambiguity represents a second dimension of decision making.This means that the RFS approach to probability estimation and the Subjective Expected Utility(SEU)theory built upon it is a special limiting case that only obtains when the information base is clear ,complete, available, and non-conflicting.Ellsberg operationalizes his concept of ambiguity by defining a variable called rho,where 0&lt;=rho&lt;=1.Rho is \\"...a number between 0 and 1 reflecting the decision-maker's degree of confidence in or reliance upon the estimated distribution... in a particular decision problem.\\"(Ellsberg,2001,p.194).Ellsberg then incorporates rho as a linear decision weight in a\\"resticted Bayes/Hurwicz criterion\\",i.e.,a decision rule that also incorporates an optimism-pessimism index. The majority of Ellsberg's work is truly original and can be readily applied in the present.Some of the things that Ellsberg does had already been done by J.M. Keynes in his A Treatise on Probability in 1921.Unfortunately, due to the misplaced influence of two error filled reviews of Keynes's approach by Frank Ramsey,95% of the reviews being based on the first 4 chapters of Keynes's book,Keynes's imprecise interval approach,which Keynes called nonnumerical or nonmeasurable probabilities , in order to emphasis the need to use TWO numerals in the estimation of a probability,came to be looked on as some \\"mysterious nonnumerical probabilities\\" that did not obey the laws of probability.Finally,in chapter 26 of A Treatise on Probability , on page 315 and page 315,footnote 2,Keynes specifies an index w ,where w equals the weight of the evidence and measures the degree of the completeness of the relevant evidence upon which the probability estimates are based.W is defined as 0&lt;=w&lt;=1.Keynes then incorporates this index into a decision theoretic criterion rule which he called \\"a conventional coefficient of weight and risk.\\"Letting c designate the \\"conventional coefficient\\",the goal of Keynes's decision rule is to maximize cA,where A is equal to some outcome.In this reviewer's opinion,Keynes's decision rule is,in an overall evaluation, equivalent to Ellsberg's rule .There are some minor differences,since Keynes's representation incorporates nonlinearity into his weighting function while Ellsberg works with a linear representation.It is the nonlinearity effect which is contributing to the creation of some(many?) of the anomalies and paradoxes in standard SEU theory.Both Ellsberg's and Keynes's work goes a very long way towards correcting these deficiencies.However,Keynes got to the mountain top first.On the other hand,Ellsberg found both a shorter,quicker way(you need to carefully read mainly one chapter,chapter 7,while in the TP you need to read chapters 3,5,6,10,12,15,17,20,22,26,29,and 30)to the top and planted another flag[in addition to rho(Keynes's w),Ellsberg also planted alpha,adapted from Hurwicz.This is a measure of optimism-pessimism.Keynes did not deal with this in the TP.In the General Theory,Keynes dealt with it informally with his conventions and animal spirit concepts].Ellsberg's chapter 7 model can thus supply a complete,formal explanation of Keynes's theories of Liquidity Preference and Marginal Efficiency of Capital in decision theoretic terms that incorporate micro maximizing behavior while simoltaneously explaining macro phenomena.This review has been revised to correct errors made by the reviewer in the original review.I now would assign this book 5 stars.The potential reader will gain much just by analyzing the various examples.For a full understanding,a reader should have taken courses in statistics,probability,and philosophy at the upper division level or have studied the equivalent on his own."},{"Title":"John T.

Remember that this was before Silicon Valley millionaires clad in blue jeans and polo shirts were widely known names.I have not read &quot;The New Dress for Success,&quot; but the old &quot;Dress for Success&quot; gives helpful tips to readers who are interested in rising in middle class society. For many years, I followed some of the advice given in &quot;Dress for Success&quot; when I purchased clothes. It was particularly helpful when I worked at the headquarters office of a large corporation.The logic in &quot;Dress for Success&quot; goes like this: the upper middle class (the business class) dresses a certain way for work and for play and if you want to gain the acceptance of the upper middle class and rise to the level of the upper middle class, you too must dress the same way. Otherwise, you will be seen as an outsider by members of the upper middle class and will not gain their acceptance. Without their acceptance, you will not rise very far up the corporate ladder.Maybe I'm missing something, but I believe that that is the logic in &quot;Dress for Success.&quot;Nowadays, a lot of this seems ridiculous to me since my tastes have changed.

John T. Molloy, who is the author, believes that a success dress is a sign of competence and class. The success dress is a kind of nonverbal language to express you and affect how other people react. Moreover, the dress will affect people&iexcl;s authoritative, power, credibility and social status. Therefore, dress plays an important role on influencing people&iexcl;s future.Due to the benefit of the successful dressing, John T. Molloy has suggested a different kind of clothing combinations, which include suit, shirt, tie, accessories and etc, for different purposes and occasions in business field. It mentions that people should pay attention on &iexcl;color, line, texture and style&iexcl; to coordinate their clothing. Not only in the business field, but successful clothing (sportswear) also reflects people&iexcl;s ability to work and classify their social status in social field.Comment for bookThe book describes and recommends some successful dressing codes very well; however, there some parts need to be improved.Some parts are goodGood dress codeWell coordinate clothing to make the successful look, it have a well-organized dressing combination code in different situation and different purposes. For example, in the job interview, the book recommends to dress gray suits, blue shirts and conservative tie because it can establish power, authority and get success in job interview.Concern the women point of viewAs the new knowledge business era, most women play an important role in executive and decision making positions. Therefore it is necessary to dress success to get the women&iexcl;s preference. And I totally agree with John T. Molloy that color of clothing can attract women. For example, the bright red ties can reflect the sexy feeling. Indeed, &iexcl;red&iexcl; color is what most women likes, and it also get a numerous attention from women. Therefore, if a man need to cooperate with a team of women or women executive, they are better to dress the bright red ties in order to draw their attention.Some parts need to be improvedNeed evidence supportTo avoid the statistic information was stolen, John T. Molloy reject to show the statistic evidences to support his opinion. However, clothing is a subjective matter, if you do not have any statistic support that it will affect the persuasive power. Therefore, it is necessary to give out some evidences to support his point of view. For example, the evidence may relate to how many executive agree his clothing combination code and the interview dressing code.Concern the cultureJohn T. Molloy describes the dressing combination code as color, texture, line and style. But I think &iexcl;culture&iexcl; is also an element on dressing combination. Dressing not only reflects personality and own authority, but also reflect his own country&iexcl;s&iexcl; culture as a character.Learning InsightAfter reading the book, I learn that different dress code reflects their personality in different occasion. A well dressing combination code can help us to get success in future. When people choose their clothing for special purpose, they should consider their clothing habit, the dress requirement of the occasion, and image that they want to project in front of the public."},{"Title":"John T.

Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"Dress for Success is dated now by almost ten years, and it would be worthwhile for a newer edition to see how the late 90's business world views clothing. Molloy obviously writes for the affluent market and much of his advice is aimed at those who can afford the services of a custom tailor or the more expensive off-the-rack suits rather than those who can afford to buy at J. C. Penny. While his price information is out of date, he still gives useful advice on the selection of color and material based on body size and shape, as well as the fitting of a suit (a proper fit will make a cheaper suit look better than an expensive one poorly fitted) that I have not found elsewhere, and his advice on accessories is not bad"},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"Although seemingly outdated, I found Molloy's advice on proper work attire to be interesting and beneficial. Molloy's book offers tips on business attire--jackets, suits and dresses. Ironically, now a days, casual seems to be the trend. Molloy does devote a chapter to the Casual Business Dress, but the novel primarily focus on the dressy look. Molloy's bottom line is, conservative is the key. Molloy explains when its most appropriate to wear suits or jackets and even more specifically which fabric makes a person look most professional.I particularly enjoyed reading the chapter which talked about colors and the influence wearing, for example, red to a job interview opposed to blue. I found it interesting that red is the most powerful color and that most successful women in the country wear red jackets. Red attracts attention and shows authority, but if power isn't the look which is appealing, darker colors seem to represent authority. I also found it interesting that wearing pastels and traditional feminine colors wont attract the power, and is an \\"invitation\\" to be challenged by male co-workers.Overall, I found this book to be interesting, yet I don't know how much of what Molloy writes I truly believe. Of course the conservative look is more appropriate in the business office, yet so many jobs are now transitioning from \\"traditional business attire,\\" to comfy and casual a book specifically devoted to the casual dress seems needed."},{"Title":"John T.

It helps me know how to evaluate a men&iexcl;s clothing in business world, how to know a men&iexcl;s personality and upbringing by just pay attention on his clothing, and know how to evaluate an interviewee&iexcl;s ability by his clothing if I am an interviewer.In &iexcl;New Dress for Success&iexcl;, it talks about how to be a successful man by dressing your appearance and physical setup of your office. For dressing your appearance, this book includes content of how to use clothing to sell yourself for business purposes (includes suits, shirts, ties, clothing combination and accessories), how to use clothing to sell yourself in leisure time, in front of women executives, and for interview, etc. In these chapters, author explains how to choose a suit, shirt and tie, etc. steps by steps, and what are the best materials, color, patterns, and clothing combination of suit, shirt, and tie, etc. Moreover, this book includes an interesting chapter of &iexcl;How to dress for success with women&iexcl;. This chapter teaches how men dress to attract women and how to be more likable to work with women by dressing suitable clothing in working place.Clothing really has a significant effect on the whole life of a man. Clothing is a sign of competence and a sign of class. It affects a man&iexcl;s personal image since it is a nonverbal language to express a man&iexcl;s personality and ability to do business. It also reflects a man&iexcl;s social upbringing and affect how other people react with the wearer. Therefore, clothing can affect a man&iexcl;s business indirectly.

Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"This book resonated with me many years ago. As our society has homogenized this book is becoming more obsolete by the minute. The studies that Mr. Malloy conducted do make sense regarding what color of suites you should wear for certain occasions, or what patterns on your tie you should avoid. You go into a conservative clothing store like Brooks Brothers for example, and you'll find that half of that store will not align with this book. The thing is I do agree with this book in many ways, but I also have come to terms that society has radically changed, and what is acceptable today was faux pas yesterday. If you adhered to some of the sartorial principles of that book today you would have the image of trying to hard, and being out of touch. Let's take watches for example. The watch that is acceptable to \\"Dress For Success\\" with a suit is a thin leather band watch for example a tank Cartier, or an old school Omega lets say. Today's watches are four times bigger than a tank Cartier. Even companies like Cartier, Omega, Piaget are making most of the watches much bigger than what is considered classy, and they are acceptable. In the world today of Dress Smart Casual look jeans are accepted. Certain loud colors of trousers are accepted in certain higher end circles. Tattoos has also been accepted in main stream. So where does that leave us? Use your common sense, and be aware of your surroundings. Read the book if you want, but know also that it's a book of yesterday."},{"Title":"John T.

It was in very good shape, no obvious wear,and of course, it is a very good read. Highly Reccommended!"},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"It's not that this is a worthless book. There is a good deal of generic advice in it that is useful and right on target. It just makes sense that those whose style of dress fits in with their coworkers and clients will do better than those whose style does not. It's entirely logical that one size does not fit all and that standards of dress will vary from company to company and within departments of the same company. Everybody knows that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and yet everybody knows that people are routinely judged by their appearance. Unfortunately, many of the specific pieces of advice that Molloy gives are outdated, incomplete, and flawed. Specifically:1) Molloy makes a big deal out of his &quot;research,&quot; and I have no doubt that he has spent a great deal of time and effort performing and analyzing it. However, from his description of it in the book, it is inherently flawed. First of all, he does not publish his methodology or his results. We have no way of knowing whether the questions he asked were reasonable and correctly put, and we have no way of knowing if his analysis of his results is correct. What he has done is completely non-reproduceable, and this significantly undermines the credibility of his claims. Furthermore, what he does tell us about his methodology if often alarming. For example, he mentions one survey in which he showed two sets of pictures (one in which men were dressed in conservative, well-tailored suits and ties and one in which the same men were dressed in the same conservative, well-tailored suits without the ties) to test subjects and asked them to guess which set contained the more successful men. Not surprisingly, the pictures of the men wearing the ties were overwhelmingly chosen. What's wrong with this test? Well, the test subjects had to know which answer was expected, and they had to give their answers accordingly. It's impossible from this test to conclude how these people would have acted in the real world. In another case, Molloy showed a picture of the wrist and hand of a man wearing a well-tailored suit and shirt with a monogram on the cuff and a picture of the wrist and hand of the same man wearing the same suit and shirt, but without the monogram. He then asked the test subjects to guess the profession of the man in each picture. Not surprisingly, the man in the non-monogramed picture was guessed to have a more presitigious job than the man in the monogramed picture. Here, we have the same problem as the other example, where the test subjects know the sort of answer that the questioner is expecting. Additionally, the pictures that the test subjects were shown don't provide the proper context: if the test subjects encountered the man in the pictures, they wouldn't just encounter his wrist and hand. Their judgment about his dress would be based on the totality of his dress, rather than just his suit and shirt cuff.2) Molloy usually doesn't try to explain why his test subjects answered the way that they did. On a certain level, the reasons for the judgments are irrelevant: if 90% of Americans believe that men wearing purple shirts are not to be trusted, then men shouldn't wear purple shirts regardless of why so many people have made that judgment about them. But Molloy does admit that judgments about clothing change over time. Therefore, it's important for the reader to understand why people make the judgments that they do so that they can better predict what the judgments will be at any given time. What may have been true in 1988 when Molloy wrote this book may not be true today.3) The clothing industry has changed substantially since 1988. Polyester-blend suits and shirts are much less prevalent today than they were in 1988. Consequently, Molloy's advice about the usefulness of blended apparel is less relevant and less easy to follow. Furthermore, the pricing information that he gives in the book is worse than worthless. A $25 tie today is likely to be cheap and undesireable; when Molloy wrote the book, $25 was considered a lot for a tie. The same can be said for the price ranges that he gives for suits and shirts.4) Molloy does not give enough attention to shoes. He barely mentions them except in passing. He gives no advice about how to determine the quality of shoes that one is considering purchasing. He apparently has done no studies about shoe styles, colors, or appearance. This is unfortunate, especially since shoes and their appearance matter to a large segment of the population.5) Molloy gives no attention to shirt collar styles. The message that a buttondown shirt sends is significantly different from the message that a shirt with a cutaway collar sends. It would have been nice for Molloy to have some discussion about this.6) As others have mentioned, Molloy really needs to update this book to pay more attention to corporate casual dress. Since this book was written in 1988, a vast number of American corporations large and small have adopted casual attire for all employees. Even IBMers no longer look like IBMers. In many ways, dressing appropriately in a casual workplace is more difficult than dressing appropriately in a formal workplace. Simply saying that the basic rules are the same casual workplaces as they are for formal workplaces really isn't particularly helpful.By all means, buy the book. The generalities that it contains are important and useful. Everybody reads this book, and it is always helpful to know what the other guy is thinking. Just remember that Molloy is not God and that the specific advice that may (or may not, given the dubious quality of Molloy's studies) have been correct and relevant in 1988 may not be so correct and relevant in 2001."},{"Title":"John T.

If it was French, it would be about why you Americans have no style and never will. If Italian, about fabrics, fashions, cars, drinks and women.

All politicians and trial lawyers MUST read this book if they hope to be successful, since the voting public and juries are made up of the people Molloy researched. Other executives, include those giving press briefings, dealing with reporters, and some sales professionals should study this book carefully.However, the book has its problems. It is in need of updating for information regarding casual dress. Many firms, including the old guard firms, are going business casual. Sales professionals are meeting customers in business casual dress. While the book speaks of the casual wardrobe, it assumes you are on the golf course, for example. My advice: buy this book if you deal with the public at all. If you are in a back office working on the network server for 12 hours a day and your boss doesn't care what (or if) you wear, go buy a couple of t-shirts instead."},{"Title":"John T.

This book was written when Reagan was President. I continually had to take Mr. Malloy's advice and project how his advice would apply today. I should not have to do this for a book titled the New Dress for Success. On the other hand, the underlying principles this book presents -- your dress matters -- dress to suit the situation -- do your research -- still apply. Consequently, this book still provides useful information for someone who needs advice on business dress. On the other hand, the color photos are very poor.

Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"you plan to keep allowing your girlfriend, wife, mother or frat buddies to influence your mode of dress for the white collar office of the 20th Century.I first purchased John T. Molloy's DRESS FOR SUCCESS (copywrite 1975) in 1987, shortly before embarking upon my initial corporate trip up the proverbial ladder.I reside in Kansas City, Missouri - not exactly a fashion capital of this nation, nor any other. This is also currently (in 2002) the #2 most obese city in our nation (and I think has been in the top 10 most obese cities for the last 20 years). Purchasing suits and other clothing in this city has been more than a difficulty for me, at 6'3\\" and 185 athletic, trim #'s.However, I stumbled across this particular book, shortly before graduating from college. I used a portion of my last student loan to purchase six suits (3 double breasted), eight shirts (all white, button down collared), four pair of shoes, black & brown, wingtip laced and tassled loafer, as well as a dozen extremely tasteful silk ties in the $30 to $40 range and a dozen pair of over-the-calf nylon socks, in 1989...And I was pretty much set.I never felt out of my league and within 30 months my salary had tripled and I was able to begin purchasing work clothing which more closely mimicked that of my executive VP's. I pretty much memorized entire passages of Mr Molloy's 1975 printing and adapted by observing my 'superiors' tastes and styles, bringing myself up to early 1990's styles.I should add, that prior to 1989.....I had never purchased nor even worn, anything remotely resembling a $600 business suit. Yet I did discover great looking suits (under $400) which required minimal to substantial alterations ( and I followed Mr Molloy's advice to a T ). I've never felt outdressed, overdressed or clownishly inept in business settings on either coast, or anywhere else while working for four Fortune 500 corporations in the last dozen years. My career is within the IT field, yet I've interacted daily with senior executives as well as newly hired staff for 90% of my career.Talent, savvy AND dressing for success (without blowing your bosses OR your customers out of the water) will add up and help you to become successful, yourselves. Business casual doesn't equate to dressing down to the level of casual business. Never wear a dress shirt without sporting a tie; never wear a tee-shirt that can be seen under your dress shirt; never purchase suit clothing which wrinkles too readily; never let your suit jacket bunch up around the back of your neck; never allow your slacks to hike up so far that they expose your calves because you chose stockings which are simply too short and inexpensive; never purchase a cheaply made, inexpensive tie; simple rules like these are so easy to follow and will always pay off for you.Buy this book, read it, pay attention, and apply Molloy's inexpensive lessons. 15 yrs from now, you'll feel like writing a coherent and helpful review, yourself.The moment I first picked up his 1975 printing, is one I'll long remember."},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"I'm leaving the military, and read this book on the advice of a couple different headhunter firms. It is a little out of date, but still is a great book.Here are some great quotes: \\"You do not want to look like Lou Costello with his pants under his armpits, and you do not want to [sag and] look like a member of the lower middle class.\\" (pg 47). [If your cuffs are higher than 5.5 inches from your thumb], you will look like a Broadway crapshooter, a fashion model, or a dandy.\\" (pg 52). \\"You can, if you are already very rich and very successful, or if you desire to have an affair with an Italian contessa, wear silk shirts.\\" (pg 71). \\"You will never, ever, as long as you live, wear a short-sleeve shirt for any business purpose, no matter whether you are the office boy or the president of the company...\\" (pg 86). \\"When we showed the picture with the monogram showing, the answers were not positive; in fact seventeen percent of the respondents identified him as a hooker-booker.\\" (pg 87) \\"One of the things that made the evening so memorable was that at one point all of the young men got together, put their hands on a Beatles album, and swore that they would never, ever, ever, wear a tie.\\" (pg 92). \\"Do not wear [a bow tie] to business unless you are a clown, a college professor, or a social commentator.\\" (pg 115).I could go on and on. This guy is hilarious, intentionally or not, and gives some good general fashion advice. Sure, things have changed a little, and the \\"four pages of full color photos\\" are a little '80s looking, but reading this book will save you from many fashion mistakes. At least it has caused me to develop an agenda as I shop for suits, and I have planned my interview attire.The best part is at the beginning, when he tells you not to listen to your wife. My wife always tells me what to wear, and it's nice to have a legit book that I can cite when I don't listen to her. It's true, the surveys and facts cited aren't particularly academically rigorous, but it's worth heeding, none the less. As a testament of the quality of this read, just look at the cover- despite being forged during the fashion nightmare of the '70s and '80s, the dark pinstripe suit, white shirt and tie are very appropriate, even today. That's his whole point- eschew fashion for the time tested, well respected look. It's a starting point, at least.The controversial point about Afros and hair grease for Hispanics is not controversial, in my book. He's not saying they're bad- he's just saying that in his experience, ethnic looks do not sell well to people from different demographics, which is probably true, even today. He also advises Southerners not to wear cowboy hats and bolo ties to NYC, and that doesn't seem to have stirred up controversy. In my opinion, that's the exact same thing. He's not telling people they can't dress as they like- he's just pointing out that any difference from the norm does not maximize your efficacy.This book is a definite buy, particularly as cheaply as it is offered used. And by the way, does anyone know what a \\"dandy\\" is?"},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"After spending years in High-Tech in the suburbs, I recently took a corporate job in downtown. Upon accepting the position, I learned that the dress code was corporate, meaning suits everyday! I went home to my closet and let my eyes wander over my collection of khakis and golf shirts with software company names on them. The job started in one week. I found Dress for Success to be my saviour.A lot of the criticism of the book seems to be that dress styles have changed over the years and the book needs an update, possibly a section on Dress Casual. Believe me, there are still many places where people wear suits everyday, and some of these people have a lot of power and money, and they have not gone out of business like the &quot;dot-commers who wear sneakers.&quot;Dress for Success helped me build a basic wardrobe. And I have received many compliments on suit combinations that are right out of the book.Remember, Molloy is writing the book to help people dress for success, not fashion or fad. He has written the book for people who wear suits, not for people who work in environments that are dress casual and they never have to interface with anybody else.I do agree with some of the other criticisms. He does gloss over some important things, (shoes, etc.,) and some of his methodology is sketchy. But after being thrust into the corporate world, I can tell you that his conclusions are eerily accurate. You can deviate from the general principles of the book, but I feel that you do so at your own peril."},{"Title":"John T.

But if you are not a rock star or a computer whiz, don't bet your career that dressing like one will get you to the Executive Suite.Look instead in business periodicals and you will see that almost all of the top dogs in power positions dress as though they were Malloy's models. Those who want to get there someday will dress as though they already are.I say as a business consultant that this book has enhanced more careers than a lot of the Business Schools have done. A great deal of career success is all tied up in other's perception of you.21 year old managers wearing pinstripe in a godawful blue/purple color with a shirt with a neck two sizes too small because they hear that pinstripe is 'powerful'. Older men wearing 'Cool Business' thinking it makes them seem more dynamic and 'with it'. Men allowing their wives or girlfriends to dress then for business. Guys wearing ties that make you wonder if their team lost or they're pledging a frat. Men wearing brown suits to a management meeting. All doomed to make their career progression a lot harder than it has to be.Take the straight route. The tried and true. Do not fall for the lines about how 'things have changed'. If things have changed, why do the President and most Senators - where the projection of power and confidence are critical - still dress straight from 'Dress For Success'?Your first impression and perception by others is fast - and permanent.

Wanting to tweak your wardrobe to squeeze every ounce of potential out of it?This book is a tried-and-true primer on conservative dress. The original version (1976) and this version convey essentially the same message. Go with what will make your superiors comfortable. Avoid fads and build a predictable wardrobe. If it works, don't fix it. This works.There aren't a lot of glossy photos. This isn't GQ fad. Some sections are a bit light. So be it. A lot of what's missing in this book can be fleshed out googling for specifics, or by a few minutes flipping through another book in the book store.While other readers are bothered by the authors \\"research methodology,\\" I am not. Sure, there are times when it seems that the research is tailored to his message. However, the author has decades of experience. I have read several books on the subject, and they all essentially parrot this one. I accept that research is this author's schtick. As one or more reviewers might have complained, the research may appear flawed, but I contend the conclusions are valid.So what if the research is meant to dazzle? When several other books on conservative style agree, then they must all be right. I was given my copy of this book by an executive friend of a major company. He chalks up some of his success to this book, and I can say that in dress he follows the advice of this book. I'm mid-career and see this merit of this book. He's at the top and swears by it.The author hoped to convey three messages: 1) your attire is a tool, 2) the name of the game is efficiency, and 3) that the reader see that some of what is offered will add to his success.

I'm in the typically casual area of Technology, but in a large Banking firm (one of the biggest). When the whole company went &quot;corporate casual&quot; I wasn't sure what to wear. We got corporate discounts to some of the more trendy yet sleightly upscale places like Banana Republic and J Crew, so I went out and bought a bunch of pants and shirts.After reading Dress for Success, I see just where and how I went wrong. John Molloy speaks with authority, as well he should. His methods are based on scientific research, not opinion. He's conducted numerous studies on the effects of various types of suits on different segments of the population, most importantly, people in positions of power (your boss, major purchasers, etc.). Also on the middle class, on different regions of the country, women, etc. If you're a salesman in Tulsa Oklahoma looking to increase your sales, this book is just as effective as if you're a young New York Lawyer taking his first case, or if you are a Financial Analyst at the New York Stock Exchange.While it seems simple, and when I try to explain it's precepts to others, they dismiss it as being simplistic, or believe they already know everything they need to know, this book has revolutionised the way I view clothing. You either dress in a way that will impress your audience (i.e. your boss, your customer, etc.) or you don't. When I try to explain the differences to people who haven't read the book, they don't understand. It's too subtle.Most people from a working-class background don't understand, or pay attention to the way the upper class dress. Fewer still pay attention to how their clothing may affect how they are perceived. Any attempt at describing the 'rules' would be an oversimplification.Reading, not skimming, the chapter on how to put a suit together taught me a lot. I'm now confident that I can buy a suit (where just a few weeks ago I would've had no idea where to begin).I even play a game now where I look at the business people, and others who are more casually dressed, and try to guess their income level, where they will peak in their career, what their socio-economic background is, etc. I've even gotten my girlfriend involved in this game. It's great fun in restaurants.What was previously unconscious is now a conscious process. My perception has been heightened, my eyes opened. I now know why I think someone is competent and why someone else is not, and I know how my working class background clearly shows through in my wardrobe, even when I think I'm dressing well.Now that I am aware of how appearance affects myself others, I can Dress for Success.Many will gripe that it lacks in details in some specific areas. For example, there is no mention of how many buttons a suit should have. Let me defend this book by saying that no matter what it will raise your standards for dress. Some things, you will just have to observe. What kind of shoes does your boss wear? his boss?Though there is no real mention of &quot;business casual&quot; in this book, many of Molloy's criteria, and thinking patterns can be used to build a casual wardrobe. Obviously, dress as well as the people you want to impress. Be observant of how they dress. Shop (or at least browse) in upscale stores, etc. More importantly, dress in a way that will impress them.More than the details (and there are plenty) this book's contribution has been to the way I see myself, and the way I see the role of clothing and appearance. For that, I thank John Molloy. No other book can do what this one has. If you are considering it, buy it. It's like getting a peak into the other man's head and knowing what he thinks of you.This book also has sections on how to compensate for being overly large or small. How to dress to impress women, how to dress in different parts of the country, etc.I'm also interested in Casual Power by Sherry Maysonave. I own and didn't like Color for Men. I own and do like (but have only skimmed) the Etiquette Advantage in Business.Write with questions, comments or to discuss."},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"After reading Dress for Success numerous times, I feel it is of great help in informing men on such topics as how a shirt should fit, how to tie a tie, how to get a suit fitted, etc. However, in the last ten-plus years corporate dress has changed more than in any previous period. The reader today has to keep in mind that the book was written in 1988 and as such should be considered in the proper context. Subsequently, it does not take into consideration the proliferation of casual attire in the business environment, and it predominantly considers how to dress like an executive, which may not be possible for an entry to middle level manager on a limited budget, even if clothing is bought on sale. The notion of borrowing to build a wardrobe also seems outdated. Today, society has become considerably more conscious of value and is less likely to drop large amounts on wardrobe. It is often hard to visualize what is meant by soft blue, light blue, midrange blue, dark blue, navy blue, etc. Some closeups of fabric swatches would help. As a college student, it would help if a whole chapter were devoted to college interviewing rather than a few pages.All in all, the book is a great asset for any man, but an updated version would be of great benefit."},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"I recently realized that my 1999 review is one of the featured reviews! Boy have I come a long way since then, but the concepts in Dress for Success have not changed a bit. It continues to be the best book to use to get started. I continue to advocate for the following adjustments though:-Eliminate discussion of blends and only focus on natural fibers.-Add a section on shoes.-New photographs. Although some styles stay constant, some of the pictures are dated. Also, spread the photos throughout the book as the concept is being illustrated, rather than clustered in the middle. Perhaps some illustration of the wrong choices as well as the right ones would help.-Broader discussion for college students.-Updated price information.-Some studies and information on business casual."},{"Title":"John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"I read Dress For Success when I was a skinny, baby faced teenager. I was so impressed by the book's research and conclusions that I bought a custom made navy pinstripe \\"power suit\\", and accessories to match. Then I conducted a social experiment.Dressed to the nines, I walked around the downtown skyscrapers and looked for a summer job. I was shocked by the reactions of strangers, and later by people who knew me well.I was accustomed to being \\"invisible\\". Suddenly, people treated me with respect. When a less impeccably dressed septuagenarian walked up to a revolving door the same moment I did, he slowed down, and gestured that I go through first. I did. He treated me as if I were his superior. Yet I was still just a seventeen year old kid.Although women had always ignored me, suddenly women flirted with me - one of them blatantly and persistently.On my way home, I met a neighbor who I had known for years. In the middle of the street he engaged me in conversation. He asked me about my ambitions, and how I intended to realize them. Although he had known me for years, he had never really talked to me before. But suddenly, he treated me as a respected peer.When I got home, my elder brother saw me for the first time in my \\"power suit\\". He swore at me, then stared at me, wide eyed, in stunned silence.I had expected that I would make a good first impression when I was dressed in a \\"power suit\\". What surprised me was that even people who knew me well seemed to reassess me. It was as if they felt they had always underestimated me. It was as if suddenly they saw me as a different person.Fashions change - even mens fashions - but the principles I learned in Dress For Success endure. The only reasons I give this book four stars and not five is that the information in the book has not been updated in about thirty years, and it does not dive deep into the fascinating psychology of the trappings of power. For this I recommend \\"Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion\\" by Robert B. Cialdini.But perhaps I am being overcritical.If you dress like a bum (as, admittedly, I still often do), you need this book. Don't argue with me, just get it and read it. It will be a revelation.If you dress well, I still recommend this book. You will learn a thing or two, and you will probably tighten up your ability to dress to impress.It is amazing how a minimum of effort in the style department can maximize results in both your professional and personal life."},{"Title":"John T.

Now I can dress right for any situation (if I want to) and don't have to spend lots of money buying the latest fashion. It's not a matter of trying to impress other people, but knowing what's appropriate to wear in various situations, and taking control of how others will perceive you.

The simple act of switching to 100% cotton commercially laundered shirts and tasteful ties when my fellows were wearing plaid wash-and-wear, I believe, set me apart from the crowd in the eyes of my superiors and opened the doors to the successful career I have enjoyed for the last 30+ years. I thought laundering shirts was expensive at the time. Looking back now I recall that they cost 29 cents each (with a coupon!). Best investment I ever made.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"John T.

And like a lot of young men caught up in the Peacock Revolution, I resented any attempt the restrict me.Fortunately, I bought the book and once I let myself get into it, my sartorial life changed. And it had an inestimable effect on my business success.The research angle was clearly a hook to sell his consulting service and the book. But if Molloy's methodology isn't rigorous enough to satisfy those who hide in academia, his conclusions are based on real-world observation, not the whim of a fashion designer or fad-obsessed magazine editor.Yes, the photos were mediocre even then and it's a pity it hasn't been been updated to give it better production values. But Molloy has likely passed from this earth and the publisher is just mining the franchise.For the discerning, any of the fine books by Alan Flusser of Bruce Boyer are unsurpassed.But the average young American male doesn't need an education in fine points; he needs a primer, and this is still unexcelled."},{"Title":"John T.

Molloy's New Dress for Success","review":"After reading John T. Molloys book, &quot;The New Dress For Success&quot;, I was encouraged to here someone hold the line of proper dressing for men. Even after thirteen years the book is still quite up to date. Not every company goes for the &quot;Business Casual&quot; look today and that is a fact. Mr. Molloys principles for suit shopping and investment are an absolute must for any man who works within corporate America. This book was written with everyone in mind that wants to make the proper impression, therefore not every subject was delt with in extreme detail. The reader must bear in mind, the author is not laying down laws unchangeable, but rather explains unwritten rules our western society adheres to. And these rules, formerly unspoken, are now revealed in his book. Many chapters are an absolute necessity for todays emerging young men who are mostly ignorant or rather purposely negligent about their professional appearance. I'd say well done, John.

This period shows various transitions from the period around the Norman invasion to just after Agincourt and shows how troops were called up, composition of forces, costs, and other fascinating data points. This data and the context given gives a good picture of how military campaigns were undertaken and what was required to operate in the Middle Ages.Now my caution. This work can be rather dry at times but if you're willing to work through that I believe you will find this very useful and engaging."},{"Title":"Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages: The English Experience","review":"THE GOOD: This book gets two stars ONLY because (as the previous reviewer said) there is a lot of information. Had there not been so many facts, the book would have gotten 1 star. The book is laid out well and there are some very interesting illustrations and pictures which are well supported by informative captions. That's about where the \\"good\\" ends...THE BAD: The problem with this book is that it is not written in a way that allows the reader to really sink their teeth into this wonderful period in history. I tried...I mean, i REALLY tried to get into this book but reading it was an excercise in frustraion. Reading this book was like reading the most boring high school text book that could be found. What frustrated me the most was that some of the chapters had real promise. I started such chapters - like \\"Seige Warfare\\", \\"Chivalry\\" and the like with great anticipation thinking that finally the writer had broken his trend (explained in THE UGLY) only to find out it was more of the same style of writing...which brings me to...THE UGLY: Here is a snapshot of how each chapter is written: Title: Rewards...in 1053 King X gave so and so this much money...in 1104 King X gave so and so this much money...in 1223 King X gave so and so this much money...etc...Next Chapter - Infantry: In 1104 King X had 5000 infantry...records show in 1223 King X had 2000 infantry...etc...you see the pattern? And this dominates throughout the entire book! I wished the author would have broken it down by periods so it could read more like a story. The way it was written really prevented me from staying interested, which was frustrating because I really wanted to be.Ubermonkey says you can probably find a better book which covers this topic in a way which does it justice."},{"Title":"La Reina Isabel Cantaba Rancheras / Queen Isabel Sang Rancheras (Spanish Edition)","review":"Excelente relato del pueblo.

Set in Japan, during the 50s and 60s, the stories are about unsolved crimes, 6 crimes which we, as the readers, follow along with the main characters, be they murders, bystanders or police. I really enjoy the feel of Matsumoto's Japan, a Japan still trying to find itself in a Post-World War Two/Cold War world, a mixture of train schedules, rare if modern phones, old fashion kimonos and tea.I also enjoy the details he pours into each story.

They are basically police procedurals, sometimes told from the criminal's (identified as such at the outset) point of view, so the intellectual excitement of, say, an Ellery Queen novel is entirely absent. And they are narrated in a style too close to real life, thus lacking the tautness that is (or should be) a hallmark of the genre. In the blurbs you read about \\"infernal twisters\\", but believe me, there aren't any. And as in most real life cases, the suspect turns out to be the culprit: no others are allowed to provide a minimum of suspense.On the other hand, the style also makes the stories charming and wistful, somewhat as a lifelike, criminal version of \\"Snow White\\" or \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\". Everything is plain, there are neither hidden meanings nor antiheroes or anguished existential musings. Traces of the old Japan surface almost constantly, and this is perhaps the stories' most attractive aspect.All in all, if you can conceive of an idyllic criminal book, this is it. It isn't memorable, but if you read it, you'll wish you could live in such a time with such a people."},{"Title":"Les Trois Mousquetaires","review":"The copy is terrible and unreadable.

Babbitt. Arrowsmith","review":"This great collection has Sinclair Lewis' first three successful novels: Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith. All three are excellent, and this is an ideal way to get them if one does not have them already.The book that made Sinclair Lewis famous, Main Street was the first in a remarkable series of 1920s novels that earned him a lasting name and ensured him a spot in the American canon, though several taste revolutions ensure we now see it very differently. To understand Main Street's immediate titanic impact it is necessary to recall when it was written and published. It came out in 1920, between World War I and the Great Depression. The universal sourness left by the former still lingered, and the economic boom leading up to the latter's massive bust had not really begun. America was cautiously optimistic but knew major changes were needed and that many had already come - for better or worse. Main Street reflects two changes that had become undeniable: the twilight of American village dominance and the expanding role of women. The pioneer days that led to small settlements like Lewis' actual hometown of Sauk Centre, Minnesota and Main Street's fictional Gophers Prairie, Minnesota were already all but gone by the time of Lewis' 1885 birth. Growing up, his generation saw its dying gasps. By 1920, cities had emerged as the indisputable center of American progress in all forms: political, social, artistic, intellectual. The death of small towns was proclaimed - gladly by most; regretfully, if sentimentally, by some. On the other hand, the Progressive Movement in many ways culminated in 1919, when women were given the right to vote. This, coupled with the greater independence and connection with the world outside the home forced on them by WWI, ensured they were an ever-growing force.Main Street synthesizes these elements into brilliant, mostly satirical but thoroughly realistic fiction. Carol, its protagonist, is a prime example of the (then-) New Woman: educated, independent, willful, and ambitious. Its main setting is the sort of American small town that then seemed to be undeniably dying. The inevitable conflict between the two and all associated controversies - conservatism vs. liberalism in politics, mores, gender roles, etc. - is vividly dramatized. We see many contemporary sociopolitical issues played out movingly and instructively. The book is extraordinary in making many of the same points Betty Friedan later famously made in The Feminine Mystique - all the more extraordinary in being decades earlier and written by a man. It is thus unsurprisingly a classic of feminist literature. Like many twentieth-century American women, Carol left college with a passionate desire to reform the world but little idea how to do it. After several years of dreaming but little practical result, she decides to marry and ostensibly \\"settle down\\" after all but cannot bring herself to abandon her dreams. Yes, her husband will be the breadwinner, and she will run the house while taking care of the inevitable children, but she does not despair; she will reform the small town to which she moves. Sadly, again like many real-life women before and even today, she finds that her vague dreams are no match for Society and Custom. She fights against them for years in varying ways with small successes here and there but never gets beyond tolerable equilibrium. Several times she threatens to run away or take some other radical step and eventually does - only to return, somewhat begrudgingly but not without hope. Lewis beguilingly leaves the ending somewhat open. Carol is neither glad nor sorry to have returned and settles back into routine easily enough, realizing she will never achieve her aspirations but resolving to keep trying. She has gained a new practicality and may get somewhat further. She even has newfound appreciation for Small Town America and its ways in certain respects and is essentially cured of nave notions that she had developed more from imagined contrast with her drab existence than from experience or reality. However, we are left in little doubt that she will be more or less a failure, arguably not even a grand one. She will live out her life just like nearly all women for all practical purposes, dying as if she had never lived - ideals broken, goals unfulfilled. The book ends somewhat abruptly with her practical, down-to-earth, traditional husband ignoring her last-ditch rationalization to talk of the eternally mundane - a dread foreboding of her life to come. It is a pretty bleak depiction of the New Woman's future - certainly depressing for anyone then interested in it to complicate.But there is far more to Main Street, and it is not nearly as dark in tone as I have implied. Indeed, like Lewis' other famous works, it is generally satirical - often bitingly but at least as often humorously. He was a diverse author who can be appreciated in many ways, not least in his dramatically vivid depictions of the small town Upper Midwest in the early twentieth century. This puts him solidly in the grand tradition of American local color writers. His brilliant ear for dialogue is one of his greatest strengths here, but his thoroughly realistic style also shines; as fellow small town Minnesotan Bob Dylan puts it in Chronicles Volume One, Lewis was \\"the master of absolute realism, had invented it.\\" He has a near-unmatched eye for little details and is one of the most visual of writers. His depictions of small town life - from store front descriptions to almost Dickensian deftness with character traits and quirks - truly make his settings come alive. Even a well-done film could hardly convey them more palpably. From early on, some derided Lewis' descriptions as too inclusive to be artistic, and they probably are something one either loves or hates. However, they are certainly an important part of his style and a cornerstone of his realism. Yet his style is not, as one might easily assume, boring or stilted. This is where satire serves him best. There is something to grin at on nearly every page and often something to laugh aloud at; the send-up of Small Town America's failings, foibles, conceits, and pretensions is caustic and enduring. He criticizes where appropriate and is often merciless even when most amusing. Many well-known small town faults - hypocritical piety, arrogance under the guise of humility, jealousy of cities under veil of complacency, etc. - are shown with stunning skill, and it is no exaggeration to say the contempt most Americans now at least claim to have for small towns stems in large part from Main Street, whether or not they know it. That said, it is easy to exaggerate this aspect of the novel and of Lewis generally, as he is above all notably realistic. Lewis unforgettably shows that small towns are more than just laughs, even satiric ones. Tragedy creeps dreadfully in more than once; several subplots involving minor characters are especially heart-wrenching. His satire also turns to wider arenas; indeed, another way to appreciate Lewis is through his examination of contemporary issues. One can almost see his novels as satirical American versions of Henrik Ibsen's famous \\"problem plays.\\" The religious satire that would come to fruition in Elmer Gantry is especially prominent here. It is instructive to see how much this issue has changed, though still prominent; how incredible to realize that Sunday driving and recreation were actually controversial in 1920! Perhaps more importantly, if more inclined to satire than charity, he nonetheless convincingly shows small towns' few positive aspects and has much to say of pros and cons relative to cities. Some of Main Street's characters are so viciously lampooned that those inclined to defend may call them unfairly one-sided, though others have virtuous qualities depicted, sometimes even in regard to city-dwellers. One can easily retort that the fault lies not in Lewis but in the upstart yokels he drew from, but his take on them is in any case leavened by playful pokes at Carol and others who think themselves so superior to Gopher Prairie and its ilk. They may well be right but are surely not as right as they think - and Lewis will not let them or anyone else forget.The depiction of Carol is indeed one of the more interesting facets. She was a radical, even revolutionary, character at the time and still stands out as a strong, thoroughly modern heroine; she would have been unthinkable in a mainstream work even a few decades prior. Yet she is far from idealized; even the most sympathetic feminists cannot deny some of her less appealing qualities, such as vanity, materialism, and bouts of classism. Indeed, those so inclined could even somewhat plausibly argue that she is satirized just as much as other characters. For all her high-mindedness and talk, she is a hopeless idealist: flighty, watery, and near-comically impractical. She changes her mind within minutes on the most important topics for the slightest pretexts - and goes back just as quickly. The years have only underlined these faults; she can now easily seem nave, even silly, for the same reasons she struck initial readers as vibrant and full of potential. That said, it cannot be seriously doubted that Lewis meant her to be sympathetic and, to a certain degree, proscriptive. Her faults, such as they are, essentially serve to make her well-rounded; above all, she is believable. She is not meant to be perfect so much as Everywoman - or what Lewis thought Everywoman could or would be. Besides, she has several inarguably admirable qualities, including determination and stamina. She still stands as one of American literature's - nay, literature's - strongest and most distinctive female leads.As all this implies, though not really written as such, Main Street can easily be seen as a historical novel. To be sure, it is a fascinating glimpse into an important, distinct American era in nearly all sociopolitical aspects. It also of course gives much insight into early twentieth century American Small Town Life and women's issues. Some would perhaps call it dated for these reasons, but there is a strange sense in which it is at least as relevant as ever. The edition I read was from the early 1960s with an Afterword by Lewis biographer/critic Mark Schorer that says contemporary readers see the novel far differently than initial ones because, among other things, Small Town America's fate had been sociologically decided - i.e., was virtually gone and soon would be for good. Yet it remains nearly fifty years later. Nearly all Americans are at least outwardly contemptuous of small towns, and most are probably genuine, but there is also a wide-ranging sentimental streak keeping them alive. Perhaps more importantly, their actual inhabitants, though shrinking each year, are largely unchanged - at least as self-righteous and complacent as Lewis depicted nearly a century ago. I grew up in one even smaller than Gopher Prairie in the 1990s, and it is still virtually the same - proudly ignorant, xenophobic, fiercely resistant to change, etc. -, as are its thousands of nationwide counterparts. Indeed, hard as it is to believe, they have actually in some ways even worsened; I cannot begin to imagine the residents of mine even having heard of the intellectual and literary people and concepts Carol is dismayed at Gopher Prairie consciously turning down. Small towns thus continue to cancerously cling to the main American movement of growth and progress and show no real sign of disappearing any time soon. Main Street will continue to have special relevance as long as they exist.However, this is a small part of its legacy. It will surely continue to be read as long as great literature is appreciated because, important as its time-specific elements are, its core themes are timeless: individuality vs. collectivity, idealism vs. practicality, knowledge vs. ignorance, etc. Lewis wrote powerfully about these issues in a way that spoke profoundly to contemporary readers and speaks to us hardly less relevantly or meaningfully - as it doubtless will continue to long after every vestige of \\"Main Street\\" and all it stands for are finally beyond memory.1922's Babbitt is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and one of the best twentieth century American novels, essential for anyone interested in Lewis or the era.Babbitt satirizes American urban life and depicts the American Everyman. The latter is its best-known and most insightful aspect. The character of Babbitt epitomizes 1920s' middle class values; obsessed with consumerism and money making, he embodies conservatism, Republican politics, and WASP supremacy. In short, Lewis deftly drew the kind of American then growing more common each year - and more importantly, the ideal to which, outwardly at least, more and more people aspired. Babbitt is one of the most vividly drawn and fully lifelike characters I have seen in the hundreds or thousands of books I have read; he not only seems real in himself but the very image of many people I have known. It may be very hard to like him; he is vain, ignorant, narrow-minded, shallow, hypocritical, temperamental, and many other unsavory things. That said, it is almost impossible to hate him; he is truly kind to his friend Paul and has occasional insight as well as admirable if thwarted ambition. Despicable as his thoughts and actions sometimes are, we cannot shake the feeling that he is decent at heart. An early reviewer made the all-important point that few will see themselves in Babbitt, but all will see people they know - probably many. He is the apotheosis of an important American type, perhaps the era's dominant one and still very prominent. More fundamentally, he is essentially human; for all his faults, any honest person will feel with and for him, because his failings and many of his strivings are central to the twentieth/twenty-first century human condition. Nearly everyone in current Western society can sympathize greatly with his doubts and struggles. Babbitt is at times nothing less than loathsome and often risible, yet it is hard to laugh at him, much less anything harsher; he is really more pitiable than anything.This gets to the book's more important American dream critique. Babbitt is ostensibly successful in a way most Americans would envy yet plagued by uncertainty. He has gone about life unthinkingly for years but is suddenly haunted by dissatisfaction and a dreadful feeling of hollowness. Lewis was ahead of his time in depicting this malaise, which was not generally admitted for decades. He exposes American society as not only superficial but largely artificial, dominated by crass, anti-intellectual commercialism and unthinking conservatism. The novel rigorously condemns capitalism at its worst, vibrantly showing how it dehumanizes and saps culture. Much of this is done via brilliant speech evocation; Lewis was one of the first to use contemporary American speech fictionally, and Babbitt is perhaps its height. H. L. Mencken, author of The American Language, rightly praised it. Lewis had a great ear for slang and uses it with aplomb; one of his key insights is just how thoroughly commercialism had invaded speech. He also invented slang terms, several of which entered popular use, as did \\"Babbitt\\" and \\"Babbitry.\\" This is such an essential part of the work that a glossary was necessary in European editions, and the book did much to make Europeans aware of American slang.Babbitt also searchingly dramatizes a range of other related and important issues, including masculinity, femininity and feminism, religion (the focus of Lewis' later Elmer Gantry), race, and class. It is often satirical but sometimes ponderously thought-provoking and occasionally tragic. Lewis is typically called a satirist, but this sells him rather short; his range is significantly wider, but even more important is his strong artistic skill. Anyone who likes Main will like this, though the latter's good humor profusion is largely missing, but Lewis' artistry had clearly improved. The episodic plotting that many criticize him for is mostly gone; Babbitt initially seems episodic, but a closer look reveals a very deliberate progression. This is all the more remarkable in that hardly anything really important seems to happen; the book begins with a near hour-to-hour account of Babbitt's everyday life and continues focusing on apparent minutia. However, these small events are more meaningful in retrospect and form an important whole. The primary improvement over Main is that the ending is not arbitrary but extremely deliberate and indeed, given the writing's steady march, all but inevitable in the best artistic sense. It is also unusually hopeful for Lewis, suggesting that, however savage his critiques, he believed things might change for the better.This sadly has not occurred; Babbittry has grown ever more pervasive. The novel was written at an important time in American history - between World War I and the economic boom preceding the Great Depression. All this shows up; WWI is hardly mentioned openly but looms like a ghastly demon, fueling dissatisfaction and insecurity. Lewis memorably dramatizes the poor economy's effects: labor unrest, growing radicalism, emboldened reactionaries, etc. The Jazz Age decadence famously chronicled by contemporaries like Fitzgerald and Hemingway is also on display. It was a dark period, and Lewis chronicles brilliantly; his realism and attention to detail ensure that one can learn more about the era here than in any history book. We not only see what daily lives were like but absorb much about a wide variety of subjects: politics, speech, gender roles, sexuality, fashion, music, cinema, economics, and practically everything else. Perhaps most revealing is a candid picture of Prohibition era drinking. The book answered several questions I had always had and taught me much.The fact that Babbitt so completely embodies its era unsurprisingly led to a decline in its and Lewis' reputation when the era became a dim memory. However, those who wrote him and it off were unrealistically optimistic. The realization that later prosperity was mostly illusory and the continuing existence of nearly everything the book criticizes make it seem newly relevant. It may indeed be more relevant than ever, but the unfortunate truth is that it has always been relevant. The novel is certainly a timepiece in many ways, giving it great historical value, but several core themes - not least its conformity send up - are eternal, and its depiction of existential unease is central to the present human condition. We were unwise to write Babbitt off and must not repeat the mistake; it has much to teach us and is also highly entertaining with much to provoke thought and emotion - an essential early twentieth century American novel.Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.This is a superb compilation that should be quickly picked up by anyone who comes across it."},{"Title":"John Constantine Hellblazer: Original Sins","review":"These early stories of John Constantine are the best.

These were, in my humble opinion, some of the very best in comic book writings that could be out there. Why oh why, then, has Vertigo never launched more of Delano's work in Hellblazer? The first story arch that you see here really is not a complete one. In fact, you miss about three or four issues that show the conclusion to the whole story. And that is a shame. Vertigo really should combine the whole work together into one graphic novel. And even more so, should bring into graphic novels the other stories that Delano wrote for Hellblazer. His John Constantine is one of the best, even better IMO than Ennis' Constantine, that has ever been out there in publication. Of course what made Delano's work so well is that his stories were deeply rooted in the mindset and spiritset and politicalset '80s England. Ennis', on the other hand, was more of a '90 Constantine.

Based on the Biblical Cain, Kane is an immortal who wanders his world (a version of Earth) hatching plots and trying to stave off boredom. Wagner decribes him as six feet tall, 300 pounds of muscle with red hair and beard. His most remarkable feature are his eyes, which are a piercing blue and contain a insane killer's gleam- the mark of Kane. Immensely strong and lightning quick, Kane is master of all weapons and combat types. Kane is also a sorcerer of great power. Wagner's creation is utterly amoral, at times a leader of ravaging armies or bandit bands. Sometimes he is hunted by those trying to seek righteous vengence or rid the world of his evil. The stories span thousands of years and the last ones take place in contemporary San Francisco and London. Dispite the monumental evil which Kane has perpetrated in his millennia long existance, the reader can't help but root for him. That's good writing!"},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"A decade after his death, somebody finally got around to compiling a tribute to the late, great Karl Edward Wagner and his greatest creation, the arch-hero, Kane, in a two-volume set: Gods in Darkness, the Complete Novels of Kane, and this volume, The Midnight Sun, which contains all of the short stories, poems, etc., that have been floating around, mostly out of print, for the last decade or so.Kane was my first experience with Wagner. Back in the '70's, when I was still a wee lad and most of my friends were reading stuff like The Outsiders, I stumbled on a paperback copy of Death Angel's Shadow, the one with the Frazetta cover, and spent the next few nights hiding in bed; under my covers, flashlight on long after midnight, altering my mind with this combination of Robert E. Howard and Lovecraft.Now, after reading most of his published work, for my buck, the noveletta's contained here are absolutely Wagner's best writing, period. The shorter Kane stories are nightmarishly bizarre, violent, and punchy, unlike Wagner's complete novels which tend to be a bit bloated and have a tendency to lose momentum (although they're still worth reading, by all means). The novel Bloodstone (contained in 'God's') is particularly inconsistent. That seems natural, since Wagner tended to work in the short story format, both in his own work and as the editor of other authors' works, in his many horror anthologies.As far as the compilations go, they're okay. There are lots of typo's in the text (nitpicky, I know, but c'mon...), and frankly, my biggest gripe - the Ken Kelly covers just stink. Nobody does Wagner and Kane (or fantasy illustration in general) justice like Frank Frazetta.Anyway. Say what you will about the likes of Lin Carter, L. Sprague de Camp, Manly Wade Wellman, Fritz Leiber, et al, there are really only two masters of what's come to be known as 'dark fantasy': Robert E. Howard, and Wagner.This volume is great. Pick it up and enjoy."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"This book is a fitting companion to Night Shade Books previous release \\"Gods in Darkness\\". The text is crisp and clean and I have only noticed one typographical error. This book brings together for the first time all of Karl Edward Wagner's short stories and poems about his mystic swordsman anti-hero Kane. The stories are presented in chronological order which is a nice change. Readers who own \\"Night Winds\\" will note that \\"Sing A Last Song of Valdese\\" now preceeds \\"Lynortis Reprise\\" and \\"Raven's Eyrie\\". My only complaint, and it is minor, is that Night Shade didn't include an overall chronology of the Kane stories in both of it's editions. I first read Wagner's Kane stories when I was 13 years old. Twenty-two years later they still hold their appeal and I'm saddened that there will be no more tales of Kane. Hint, hint, perhaps there is an author out there willing to pick up where Wagner left off. My favourite tale in this entire collection is \\"Reflections for the Winter of my Soul\\". This is one of the best werewolf stories I have ever read and I think it would make a great adaptation to the screen or a show like \\"The Outerlimits\\" or \\"Tales From the Darkside\\"."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"During his much-too-short life of only 49 years, Karl Edward Wagner was known for a few things. He was known as a horror/dark fantasy author, mainly the stories and novels involving his Kane character. He was also known as the editor of numerous horror anthologies. And he was known to party hard.I first discovered the writings the Wagner through this book, The Midnight Sun, a collection of his Kane short stories. This particular book was published in the early 2000s by Night Shade Books, a known publisher of fine works of speculative fiction.Why did I get this book? Well, I had heard of Wagner as an editor, but I had never experienced his actual writing despite being told by numerous sources that he was a quality author. Also, I myself tend toward mixing fantasy and horror in my own writings, and I had heard Wagner was known for this.But the book was difficult to find when I went searching for it. No book stores had it. The publisher, at least at the time, was no longer printing it. And Wagner's older works, his novels, were particularly difficult to find, and I spent weeks upon weeks scouring used book stores for anything by Wagner. Then one night I was scanning through eBay, and sure enough, this book was available.I snagged it up, and a few days later the book arrived in the mail.I've been thankful ever since, and hold this book in high regard.Wagner's short stories in this collection pinpointed particular times in the life of his Kane character, initially a swordwielding mage of extreme power who is immortal. Eventually the reader figures out this Kane is actually the Cain from the Bible, or at least some version of Abel's brother. The reader also discovers that Kane is quite ruthless and possibly insane. Also, being immortal, Kane exists in many worlds in many different times. Some of the stories in this collection are in another world seemingly far in the past, but a handful of the tales are set in modern times. Throughout these stories, Kane seems to have one goal, vengeance against God, and Kane often goes to extremes in searching out this vengeance.Kane is rarely likable, though he can at times be somewhat honorable. Often he is ruthless to the point of betrayal, even to savagery.He doesn't sound like a very nice person, now does he?That's because he's not.But his tales are still fantastic. The writing is strong here, mixing darker elements into fantastic worlds in a manner as strong as the writings of Lovecraft but sometimes with the pop culture knowledge of Stephen King. Many of these tales are not for the weak of heart, though a few are downright sentimental.More than anything, Karl Edward Wagner showed me how horror elements could be mixed with Sword & Sorcery fantasy and still come off strong, quite strong, when done correctly. As a writer, I can only dream to be a hundredth as good as the tales in this collection."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"This is great reflection on eternal life....The stories have such unsual approaches to time and Kane. Death Angels Shadow. Far darker than Elric, far more human. Kane is a freak of nature, enduring it all. Kane, with all his power and experience, is stuck in his own present. Whenever he decides to remember, old, old things. Things that could have happened 10 years or uncountable centuries ago. The eternal Now. You can always get what you need, but what do you do when you get what you want? Thought provoking, and highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"Kane, the ultimate...what? It's hard to put Kane in a small mental box. He's a complex character, driven by internal demons to be little short of an external demon himself!This book contains all of the Kane short stories that Karl Edward Wagner wrote, and it was expected to go along with the book, Gods in Darkness, which contains the three Kane novels. It's a very good book - get both books, and enjoy!

I now understand that there were only three of them, and the one I read had left me curiously enthralled. A true antihero, a man curse with immortality out only for himself. I lot touch with the character for many years until I stumbled upon this book with its sixteen short stories about the big warrior/sorcerer cursed by a mad god for the murder of his brother. And the stories didn't disappoint. Kane is evil, but he can accomplish good as well. Sometimes by chance, sometimes to destroy evil that has gotten in his way. Wagner is a terrific writer who definitely knows how to turn a phrase. Sixteen stories separated by the centuries lived by an immortal man. I recommend this book to any lover of fantasy, especially sword and sorcery."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"Ok, most of the folks who purchased this book are probably long time fans of Wagner, Howard, and Lovecraft. You know who you are. Lol. If you are reading these stories for the first time, lucky you.

I came across it in \\"Death Angels Shadow.\\" Warner 1973. Try and find that paperback at a reasonable price lol. Anyway, Wagner spins an original and outstanding werewolf tale. Evingolis the bard is a bit more then he seems. Like Kane, Evingolis is immortal, deadly, and looking to somehow, someway, stave off the ever creeping tedium which threatens to overwhelm. The atmosphere is tight and tension filled to say the least. A remote hunting lodge the perfect setting to ratchet up the claustrophobic atmosphere. I very much enjoyed the climactic showdown between the two supernatural killers. Awesome. And Kane is by no means the favored participant in the fight. Wagner imbued Kane with an original moral perspective unmatched in the fantasy genre. That's what sets Kane apart. He is the ultimate human, making decisions in the way humans tend to do, selfishly. And I love the character for those flaws. So, read the story. Spend an afternoon reading one of the worlds great werewolf tales and Kane's struggle to survive the awesome beast's ferocious, and cunning onslaught. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"I love Wagner's Kane.

The character is a borderline sociopath but extremely amusing. Accordingly, Vance's prose style is quite artistic. He is the type of writer whose phrases you can roll over your tongue over and over. With risk of being hyperbolic, I would say Vance's work is lyrical. As far as the plot is concerned, I'll offer a little summary: the novel is about a Rogue named Cugel the Clever (he only thinks he's clever--he's actually somewhat of a fool). Cugel decides to rob a sorcerer's private abode. Alas, he gets caught. The sorcerer then forces him to commit to an adventure on his behalf. He has to go and get a magical artifact. Using his sorcery the sorcerer throws Cugel halfway across a decadent world filled with monsters, demons, strange cities, horrible wastes, etc. etc.. Thus, Cugel has to finish his mission and make his way home. In terms of structure, the novel is kind of a \\"picaresque novel,\\" a linear narrative that includes a variety of episodic encounters. If you liked Jack Vance's, *The Dying Earth,* you'll love this--but, never fear! It is not a sequel to that book. It only takes place in the same world as that previous novel. To wrap things up: if you like weirdness and beautiful language, rogue-like characters whose silly behavior will have you in tears, science-romances or romantic fantasies, then *drum roll* this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"This setting for this excellent Jack Vance story is identical to his \\"The Dying Earth' collection. This \\"novel\\" was first published as individual but related stories in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in the 1960's. We are in the far, far future on a earth illuminated by a swollen red sun. Wizards and magic have long replaced scientist and technology. Vance fashions a bizarre world redolent with an overpowering atmosphere of unknown danger and lurking peril. Nothing is, as it seems.What we have is an absorbing quest chronicle with a strong component of twisted revenge. What make this story excel is the protagonist: Cugel the Clever as he is so named. In reality he should be called Cugel the weasel or as it transpires Cugel the incompent amateur thief. Cugel is so convinced of his own capability that he blunders into circumstances that any normal wizardly type would pass on in a heartbeat.The story gets underway with Cugel making a very unfortunate decision: he helps himself to the magic paraphernalia and assorted gadgets belonging to Iucouna, one very powerful and vegenceful magician. Cugel the not so Clever is apprehended and for his bungled attempt at larceny is made subject to Iucouna's lively and ingenious discipline. The magician sends him on a simple expedition: travel to a distant land and return with an enchanted lens. To insure that Cugel does not stray from his duties and maintains his devotion and dedication to the given task Iucouna assigns a cantankerous imp. The imp, perceiving any deviations or slacking off by Cugel administers a memorable jolt to the liver.With this background established early in the book Vance takes us on a grand tour of the Dying Earth. It is a world full of magical beings and dangers. This reader found Cugel's ability to wiggle out of near impossible situations and reluctantly complete his quest, with strong encouragement from the imp of course, a very enjoyable reading experience and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"I've heard mention of Jack Vance and his Dying Earth books more than a few times in fantasy circles, but this is the first work of his that I've read. Now, I can see why writers like George R.R. Martin and Dan Simmons consider him such an influence. Vance was quite imaginative and his droll, literate style of writing sets him apart from many of his contemporaries.This novel offers plenty that dedicated fantasy readers will find appealing. Its hero, Cugel, is a thorough scoundrel who manipulates others in a variety of clever, sometimes heartless ways, then puts on a shameless show of innocence that would do an embezzling politician proud, but he's constantly finding his gains reversed, so you end up feeling some sympathy for him. The world of the Dying Earth is a colorful, baroque place populated by decadent societies, strange religions, weird, dangerous creatures, magicians, and interesting magical devices. Such is Vance's inventiveness that I lost count of the number of times I recognized an idea or an object I'd seen in some later book. There's even a virtual reality of sorts. Not everyone will like Vance's deliberately ornate style of writing, but for me, it was part of the charm. The excessively formal way the characters speak to each other while indulging in all sorts of low-minded acts can be quite funny.That said, some of the book's initial charms wear a little thin after a while. There's little structure to the overall plot -- Cugel just roams from one misadventure to the next, repeating his scheming and self-aggrandizing claims in each new place. Only a few characters persist through the whole novel. And the stilted language does get a bit tiresome -- after a while, you just want a bartender to talk like a bartender, or a brutish monster to talk like a brutish monster.But, never mind, there's plenty of wit and creativity here, and its not hard to see Vance's influence on the fantasy genre. Which is to say, on those authors who aspired to better writing than Ron E. Howard, but took their worlds a little less seriously than Tolkien did. Picture the sort of book that Terry Gilliam might have made into a movie, and you have Eyes of the Overworld."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"Jack Vance has written many brilliant stories, and I've read just about all of them, but to my mind, \\"The Eyes of the Overworld\\" and it's sequel, \\"Cugel's Saga\\" represent Vance at his absolute imaginative best. In these novels Vance's distinctive use of language is combined with what is probably his most memorable character in Cugel, or \\"Cugel the Clever\\", as he likes to refer to himself. The story follows Cugel as he is caught stealing from Iocunnu, \\"the Laughing Magician\\", and is subsequently forced to take on a nearly impossible quest to obtain for the wizard a magic cusp which, when paired with it's partner (already in Iocunnu's possession), enables the user to see into the \\"Overworld\\", and thereby live a heavenly lifestyle.Vance has a great sense of humor, and the Cugel books are probably the most comedic of all his work. Parts of this book contain some very funny social satire; at other times the humor is more reminiscent of a Looney Tunes cartoon, with Cugel alternately playing the joke or getting played himself. At one point Cugel pulls a pair of dice from his pocket to use in a gambling game, though where he could have possibly acquired them is a complete mystery, and I can't help but wonder if Vance didn't draw a little inspiration from Bugs Bunny and company.Another one of Vance's strengths is his ability to create convincing characters. This novel takes place in the same setting as his classic \\"Dying Earth\\" stories, which is to say, Earth in the far future, under a dying red sun, at a time when lawlessness is rampant and nearly everyone seems to be out solely for themselves. Few of the characters are truly likable, yet all are believable. Vance has an eye for human nature which allows him to make his characters seem familiar almost immediately.The biggest part of Vance's genius though is his ability to evoke vivid images with unusual, archaic, and yes, even made-up words, all while writing in an economical, accessible style. One could pause often while reading a Vance novel in order to look up a word you've never seen before, yet rarely do you NEED to do so, and the truth is you simply don't want to stop reading! Every word serves a purpose - it never feels like Vance is just showing off. \\"The Eyes of the Overworld\\" features some of Vance's most brilliant turns of phrase, which to my mind have to be some of the most exquisite in all of literature, fantasy or not. Unfortunately, because they occur in a tongue-in-cheek tale of \\"swords and sorcery\\", this isn't often recognized. But honestly, in high school they should have given us Vance to read instead of Faulkner, Fitzgerald, or Salinger.It should be pointed out that if you're looking for complex plots or deep symbolism, then \\"The Eyes of the Overworld\\" probably won't be to your taste. Some may also be put off by the fact that the protagonist is a picaresque \\"anti-hero\\" whom you will likely find yourself rooting against more often than not - in this case, the original \\"Dying Earth\\" book or the \\"Demon Princes\\" series may be a better place to start, for those who have never read Vance before. But for everyone else, this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"Jack Vance's EYES OF THE OVERWORLD provides another in the 'Tales of Dying Earth' series, with a fine performance by reader Arthur Morey fueling a story about a scoundrel sent by a magician he has wronged to a distant country on a journey.

Denizens of this time are a technoglogically backward and disaffected lot. The setting of this story is when human history is at its end. Everything possible has been tried and tried again. Indeed, every molecule of air has been breathed before by countless individuals.Anti-hero of this decaying world is Cugel, raconteur and self-serving everyman. Through the caprice of a magician Cugel is sent to a far-flung corner of the Dying Earth to retrieve items that the magician covets. His return, if it is to be effected, will be by any means that he can manage.Vance's descriptions of his world are vivid. The plot is picaresque and linear and Cugel's motivation(s) to get home adds momentum to the tale. Vance's underlying philosopy may seem mordant to those raised on the Hollywood ethos, but the reader eventually realizes that no one cares for Cugel but Cugel. The Dying Earth stories take up an oft-neglected theme in literature; that of the individual against everything. Antagonists abound and surcease of life's travails seems almost impossibly far off.However, what really distinguishes Vance's work is his use of dialogue. Best described as mannerist, characters speak in an archaic, overly-detailed mode that is at the same time descriptive, emotionally evocative., and humorous. While a pleasure to read, it is doubtful that this dialogue could ever be convincingly spoken. Accordingly, one should not expect audiobook formats of Vance's work anytime soon.'Eyes of the Overworld' is followed by the excellent 'Cugel's Saga' wherin the same plot is reworked in an entirely different way. The other main component of the Dying Earth stories is a collection of short stories with the same name as the title of the series. The series is not for everyone, especially those who favor Harlequin-type plots and characters."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"I first read &quot;The Eye of the Overworld&quot; in 1965 in the serialisation in MF&amp;SF when the name Jack Vance meant little to me. A generation later my original soft-cover copy has fallen apart with over-use...fortunately a later copy still serves me well when I want to forget about mortgages and school fees ! I can dip into the book at almost any part....Azenomei Fair, the river, the Silver Desert, Iucounu's manse....to be transported for a while to the strange world of the dying earth. Cugel must be the most engaging scoundrel in fantastic literature, combining low cunning, self-interest,and innocent amorality with the survival instincts of a sewer rat.The great humour of this book is brought out by Jack Vance's mastery of English and love of resounding phrases, when even an inn-keeper speaks like a character from Jane Austen.I mean, would you like someone to answer,&quot;Such was the specific appelation&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot;? The combination of bizzarre characters, creatures, and situations makes &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; my favorite Vance book,a book to read again and again as the wonders therein are unending."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"Set in the time of Vance's Dying Earth series, when our sun is on the verge of going dark forever, we are introduced to one of Vance's more remarkable creations: Cugel - a/k/a, Cugel the Clever (as he refers to himself).In the annals of fiction, Cugel is without doubt in a class by himself. He is anti-hero rather than hero - egotistical beyond belief, selfish beyond all doubt, vain as a peacock, and with an inflated sense of self-worth that would put a greek god to shame.Caught in an attempt to steal from a powerful wizard, Cugel is exiled rather than slain, sent by that very magician on an impossible quest halfway around the world. In a world populated by monsters, madmen, magicians and mayhem, Cugel's odds for success are almost non-existent. Added to his burden is the fact that the magician, in an attempt to spur Cugel to success, has attached a demonic creature to Cugel's spleen; if Cugel delays overlong in accomplishing his mission, the creature will kill him. But Cugel, who aptly styles himself \\"Cugel the Clever\\" is nothing if not resourceful; with pluck, bravado and Narcissian vanity, he sets about accomplishing his mission via outrageous schemes and outlandish scams.In short, the book is an absolute delight; laced with action, humor, and magic, it is an easy read that you won't easily forget and won't want to end."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"Cugel the Clever is sent on a quest by Iuconou the Laughing Magician to retrieve the fabulous ... No doubt I've put you off already. But Vance is determined to pay lip service to his Quest motiff, and no more. Cugel is asked to retrieve just one of the Eyes of the Overworld: he finds them immediately and it turns out that there are over a hundred to choose from. The rest of the story involves the long obstacle course that he faces on his way back home. It's an inverted quest.In fact it's a series of novellas, published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, 1965-1966 - not that this is a problem. Vance's powers of invention over the course of it all, are phenomenal. He seems incapable of running out of ideas. Most of the ideas are humourous: one or two, like the ghostly city that appears each night like a siren by the banks of a river, are genuinely sad and disturbing.Cugel the Clever IS clever, but his cleverness is useful chiefly in counteracting his own stupidity. He's also utterly ruthless. He would sell his grandmother for the price of a bottle of wine, then haggle over the price of the wine, and then somehow manage to get it for free anyway. On just one occasion, he shows - but this is open to interpretation - finer feeling. It isn't even certain how likable he is. It's clear that there must be a day of reckoning when he finally returns to face the Laughing Magician, and only when that day occurs will the reader discover which of the two he wants to win.When they do finally meet, incidentally, the storyline twists several times like a snake before lashing its tail in an unexpected direction. Don't try to guess. Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"I first read this engrossing story when I was 18 and living in the barracks in Germany in 1975.

It brings back so many memories to read again of Cugel the Clever and dream of the cusps.

Perhaps the best transference of 'Walter Mitty'to the ends of earthly history, albeit with an uncanny ability to survive at all costs! Jack Vance has influenced at least several generations of young sci/fi readers and is clearly one of the first american writers to stretch/mesh sci/fi with pure fairytale/fantasy elements. Thus, he was (&amp;still is) instrumental in the highly successful growth of sci/fantasy into the vast market it has now become! Bravo, to both JV, and the many other readers who, like me, at least have very fond memories of how 'Eyes' captivated and helped us see beyond the still somewhat myopic horizon of the world, circa 1965.

Vance's style is unique; it is hard to explain why, it has to do with the way he uses language. What comes out is a story that is sometimes wildly hilarious, in an odd, incongrous way. Cugel, the main character (known as &quot;the clever&quot;), gets out of one jam after another in a curiously inept manner, all the more funny because of the language he uses...there I go, trying to explain it again, and I just can't. You'll notice it right away, if you read the book. The storyline is fascinating..the Earth, thousands of eons in the future, when the sun is a dying red giant and history has been written and re-written countless times. Hundreds of religions and philosophies compete with one another in this world, as do an equal number of civilizations with histories extending back for millenia. Cugel is journeying through this dying Earth, trying to return home, a wonderfully funny vagabond with a knack of surviving anything that comes his way."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"The Eyes of the Overworld is the second part of Tales of the Dying Earth and the main character is one of my favorite Vance characters: the self-titled Cugel the Clever. Cugel is not the kind of guy you want to have dealings with -- he's clever, sneaky, completely selfish and remorseless. He is always trying to figure out how he can take advantage of other people in order to make his own circumstances better.In The Eyes of the Overworld, Cugel decides to burglarize the house of Iucounu the Laughing Magician so he can sell some of Iucounu's thaumaturgical artifacts. But the magician catches Cugel and punishes him by setting him on a quest to procure a lens which allows the wearer to view the overworld.Cugel is clever, but as clever as he is, he often finds himself facing a foe who, at least temporarily, manages to outwit him (which invariably surprises Cugel). This time his quest leads him on a series of misadventures in which he: gets captured by rat people... is forced to be the watchman of a village... steals more than one person's inheritance... deals with demons... trades a woman for information... impersonates a god... and travels a million years into the past. Wherever he goes, Cugel, sometimes purposely and sometimes unwittingly, leaves sorrow and destruction in his wake. He deprives people of their hope, their faith and, often, their lives.This doesn't sound like it should be very entertaining, but oh, it is! That's because the story is written in Jack Vance's singular style: high language, bizarre occurrences, and Vance's characteristic humor. I hate to say it again, but the best comparison I can make is to Monty Python. If you're a fan of that type of strange dark humor, then this should be your thing.I listened to The Eyes of the Overworld in audio format. I can't express how excited I was to learn that Brilliance Audio was producing these, and I'm pleased to report that they did an excellent job. Arthur Morey once again brought out all of the nuances of Vance's humor and he made a perfect Cugel. In fact, The Eyes of the Overworld was even better than The Dying Earth, probably because it follows the same main character rather than being divided up into separate short stories. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Overworld","review":"There's a hero, and he's on a quest. Yawn.Well, except the hero's an amoral thief and con artist, who's much less clever than he thinks he is. And he almost always gets what's coming to him. And he's being forced on this quest by the magician he tried to rob, across a landscape filled with weird beasts, marvelous items of magic, and people who are just as ruthless and cunning as he is, all underneath a sun that may go dark at any moment.Jack Vance was a genuine lover of the English language who never met an exotic word he didn't like; his stories are cunning, clever, ironic, arch and the perfect palate cleanser after a diet of Tolkien and Lewis.

As far as I'm concerned, it is one of the great unsung American masterpieces on a par with \\"A Death in the Family\\" and \\"So Long, See You Tomorrow\\". It is spare, poetic and honest. The story is a fictional eye witness account based loosely on the myth of Billy the Kid told by his sidekick. Neider uses language the way a photographer uses light.

Neider's prose is lean but poetic, and his characterizations are top-notch. I highly recommend it.Sidenote: The book later was adapted into the Marlon Brando-directed \\"One-Eyed Jacks,\\" which kept the setting and the prison scenes and that's about it.

She has tenaciously followed the laws of the United State and followed appropriate legal procedure in every attempt to reunite her daughters with her. Crimes in these United States of America are deemed crimes against the state or country therefore it is the responsibility of our legal system to exact justice on behalf of instant victims as well as the controlling authority. The United States of America has miserably failed Patricia Roush and other victims in similar situations. Unlike most nations of the world there is simply no legitimate legal system in Saudi Arabia in which a non-muslim can find justice. Saudi Arabia does not recognize our laws while they take advantage ours laws and freedoms while on our soil. The kidnapping of Alia and Aisha is not a simple civil issue of custody. It is a bonifide case of felony kidnapping of American citizens with arrest warrants outstanding for over 15 years. Saudi Arabia harbors this fugitive while destroying for life the lives of 2 American citizens and their family members here. Thanks to the efforts of Patricia Roush she found one person, Congressman Dan Burton (R-IN), with guts enough to help her expose the unbelieveable corruption in Washington, DC, the pons of the so called Royal Family, and the dehumanizing conditions that exist in the desert kingdom. Regardless of country of origin the dating game can be one of chess. When that seemingly handsome young man smiles at you, lavishes you with money, gifts and promises the planet..think of Patricia, Alia, and Aisha. Know the culture, the laws, and the risk.

Ms. Rouch explains in great detail the deceptive measures the U.S. State Department has taken in order to not offend the Saudi government yet at the same time allows hundreds of its own citizens to whither away in foreign lands.Ms. Rouch's compelling story left me angry at our own government's betrayal of the most basic of human rights, the right of a mother to be involved in her children's lives. This book inspired me to want to take action--every U.S. citizen should be aware of this story so they can arm themselves with knowledge. This book also filled my heart with sorrow for all the parents grieving the loss of their children held hostage in foreign lands. But most of all, this book left me with hope.

Her children are living a fate worse then death, but one, unlike death, that is potentially remedied, and the only response she gets to her efforts to save her children is a \\"what do expect me to do about?\\" attitude!But I never imagined how callously government officials could betray an American and put oil interestes ahead of her daughter's lives.That is why laws and diplomatic policies must be put in place; you can't rely on the good will of individuals.

In Saudi Arabia, it appeared that our government representatives only cared about the feelings of the Saudi government, and couldn't have cared less about American citizens. This was very troubling to me then, and extremely upsetting to me now. Pat Roush's book reminded me again of the shameful behavior of America's state department. Her case was not a question of a marital dispute or even child custody, it was a case of kidnapping! I am incensed that former Ambassadors end up on the Saudi payroll. Frankly, I believe it should be forbidden for any former American government official to accept jobs or money from the Saudis, or from any other foreign government. Why is this not a criminal offense?I think Pat Roush is remarkable. She has never stopped fighting for her children, against all odds. Her book is very readable, although your heart aches for her, and for her two children who never had the opportunity to grow up with their loving mother.I just wish there was something I could do to right this situation, but only our government can make a difference. Every American should be INCENSED that our own government refuses to help these mothers--actually, the state department works AGAINST these American mothers!I applaud Pat Roush and pray that one day, she'll have her two American daughters and their children back where they belong, in America.

Once you read this book, you will appreciate the freedom you have, as a woman, in the United States. I highly recommend this book. The book is beautifully written, draws you in, and keeps your attention until the very end. I enjoyed reading about Pat Roush's courage, faith and perseverance throughout the book. The road blocks, the risky steps, all in her quest to free her daughters. It takes a great deal of courage and faith to persist in fighting such an uphill battle when your own Government consistently discourages you from succeeding. Throughout the book, one feels outrage at our own Government and especially our Department of State's position on this case, all because of the \\"special relationship\\" the USA has with Saudi Arabia.I commend the author and people like former U.S. Ambassador Raymond Mabus, Ed Ciriello and Congressman Dan Burton for their courage, bravery and all their efforts in trying so hard to bring those girls home, they came so close at times, and yet in the end, the Saudis always manage to get their way, that is up until now. I want to believe those girls will find their way home soon, and I hope to have the pleasure of reading a sequel \\"Home at last\\" type of book one day.

You are an inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"This book is a sad commentary of how an American mother and two American girls were handled by individuals working for their own Government. As this book exposes, the behavior of former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Walter Cutler, is especially aggregious...had he followed the lead of the previous US Ambassador in prohibiting the issuance of visas to family members of abductors, these two American girls would have been returned to their mother and home long ago. It is absurd that US Government employees would knowingly allow family members of a foreign abductor to obtain visas to the U.S., to enjoy our many comforts, facilities and freedoms. And now, to add insult to injury, even as adults, American women are not free to leave the country of Saudi Arabia...and the US apparently won't do anything about it. This book is full of specific information on real individuals and events that play a role in current day international affairs, and should be a very serious wake-up call to any American woman involved with a Saudi Arabian man. Eye-opening, easy to read, and hard to put down. This book exposes another important way in which Saudi continues to kick sand in the faces of Americans."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"I am amazed at the misfortunes this valiant woman and her family have gone through. The author gives details of American greed for oil, leading to the unwillingness of our government to stand up for the rights of American citizens. And throughout the book, Ms. Roush is very honest, and shows great insight into herself, and both Saudi Arabia and America.Pat Roush is an inspiring role model who has shown steadfastness and determination through troubles that would have crushed a lesser person.This book is one I'm always going to keep on my bookshelves."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"Upon finishing this totalling enralling and very well written book I am amazed at the courage, bravery and endurance this woman has had to sustain for nearly two decades. Not only has she devoted her life to freeing her innocent daughters from the totalitarian clutches of a Stalinistic regime like Saudi Arabia, had to fight her own government who obviously worked as 'Saudi agents' and compromised her and her daughters in every way but has helped so very many others in similar situations.Ms. Roush keeps the reader on the 'edge of your seat' as she wages her Joan of Arc battles all alone amidst insurmountable government betrayal and abuse. What she has done for this issue of human rights for women and children caught inside Saudi Arabia not to mention her tireless work as a pioneer in international child abduction is truly astounding. Her work with legislation, media, the U.S. Congress and the United Nations not to mention all the personal time and expense she has given to those in need is an inspiration to me.I found this book to be a special gift to America - to us all; it is exactly what is needed in these days of government deception and the focus on the Middle East. Her story of love, hope and faith should be on everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"This is a heart wrenching story of one mothers fight for her children and the country that failed them.

She should have written it differently. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"When I started reading this book I felt great pity for Pat Roush and her girls. By the end of the book I still felt terrible for the girls but only annoyance for Ms. Roush.It's horrible to think about two American girls being trapped in one of the most repressive countries on Earth but what can be done really? Should a team of commandos be sent in to snatch the girls or should the American government hammer Saudi Arabia with sanctions?The first option won't fly. Nobody wants to see American soldiers get killed for the sake of a domestic dispute and if America punishes Saudi Arabia what about all the other countries? American children are in Germany and other European countries with their mothers and their American fathers can't even see them. The situation is also reversed. American parents have snatched children away from foreign born parents.This is a sad story and there is a lesson in it for the reader: think before you marry a foreigner."},{"Title":"At Any Price : How America Betrayed My Kidnapped Daughters for Saudi Oil","review":"Too bad that Ms. Roush has only learned to walk all over those who have done all they could to help both she and her daughters over the years, and for what, monetary gain? She certainly does not take one step towards helping the thousands of parents who also have abducted children currently.No, she steals a photograph for the cover taken by a disabled woman without her permission, compensation, or even photographic credit. No credit or name given to the other parents, online individuals and song artists for all the hard work they have contributed through the years, without even a &quot;thank you&quot; from this woman. Unknown little people who were trampled. Even the song writers Doug DeForest and Craig Deanto, used for her book and not mentioned by name.Some of these people still write her and other parents, even though they are suffering with MS and other illnesses. She deletes their mail and treats them like dirt. One of the people in the photo she used without permission should not be on the cover of a book about missing children! They are a known and convicted stalker. What a nightmare this woman is. With her hatred she seems to have forgotten all of the people who lended their shoulders, money and more in her times of need.Do not give this woman any more money, please. Go find a children's organization who really helps and give them the donation."},{"Title":"Blessings Among the Roses: Sharing the Beauty of Faith, Hope, and Love with Bookmark","review":"This is a beautiful book evoking images of a romantic Victorian tea house.

Enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Dark Shore","review":"I normally like all of Susan Howatch's books but I'm not too sure about this one.It's a bit like a junior version of &quot;Rebecca&quot; It's a murder mystery peopled with dark characters and the hero has a mysterious former marriage.I finished it but it left me with an unsatisfied feeling.I found it in an op-shop so I don't suppose that many people will read it these days but I'd love to talk to anyone who does."},{"Title":"The Dark Shore","review":"I agree with one of the reviewers - this has strains of Rebecca but obviously is nowhere as good as the original. The characters are not well developed and the mystery is unsatisfying. There is a feeling of incompleteness after reading this shorter Howatch novel. However it is fairly well written and the romance between the young, inexperienced Sarah, her husband Jon and the mysterious Marijohn are enough to keep you occupied."},{"Title":"The Dark Shore","review":"This novel by Susan Howatch, her first, published in 1965, has often been compared to Daphne du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" which can be said of many books of the romantic suspense/gothic genre. However, \\"The Dark Shore\\" has a compelling quality all its own. The familiar and often reused plot is here - a young bride, newly married to a wealthy and successful man, finds herself thrown into his world - namely, his home estate which is filled with secrets, danger and the shadow of his departed first wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The setting is in the same part of Britain - Cornwall. But Howatch puts her own unique spin on the often-told tale, created characters with not only a connection to the \\"hero\\" Jon Towers and his past, but also all of whom had motives for killing his first wife, Sophia. Sarah, his new spouse, eager to begin a new life with Jon in Canada, not only is very uncomfortable visiting Clougy, where Jon had resided with Sophia and the place were she met her death, but the new Mrs. Towers is also unnerved by the strong connection between Jon and his \\"cousin\\" Marijohn, who seems to have psychic abilities. Jon has another motive for returning to Clougy: he wishes to reconcile with his son, Justin, who has been estranged from him since his mother's death. It's not long before Sarah begins to notice a change in Jon, he has become withdrawn and short-tempered, and then a series of strange \\"accidents\\" begin to occur. Inevitably, the heroine begins to doubt her husband - how well does she really know him? Is he capable of murder? Is she doomed to suffer the same fate of her predecessor? Are those around him out to get her?Three other characters - Eve, Michael and Max - all have apparent motives for murder, as does Jon, but the murderer is not so easy to guess until right near the end of the novel. There are so many secrets, such a tangled web, that the reader begins to feel the same amount of confusion and terror as Sarah.The character that I enjoyed the most, besides Sarah, is Justin. He is a very appealing, sympathetic young man whom you know was hurt deeply by his mother's death and his father's distance from him. In the end, it is Justin's memory of that terrible night that enables him to discover the killer's identity and race to spare Sarah from certain death.The story and setting by today's standards seems quite dated (no cell phones or internet), but that makes the atmosphere Howatch created all the more menacing. You feel Sarah's growing sense of dread and isolation. Who can she trust and believe in?This is my favorite of Susan Howatch's novels I have read so far, next to \\"The Waiting Sands\\".\\"The Dark Shore\\" is a good starting point if you want to try out Howatch's novels or if you are a newcomer to the classic romantic suspense genre."},{"Title":"The Dark Shore","review":"A detective story, close to the &quot;How done it?&quot; genre.

Basically, it spends the first 20 pages convincing you that you want a job, about 100 pages listing types of jobs and what's involved for them, and the last 100 talk about resumes, interviews, and applications. The interview tips are simple like &quot;Don't wear gobs of makeup&quot;, no big secrets or really helpful info.

The illustrations are simply beautiful--they capture the mood of both girls and cats, and the use of light is sublime."},{"Title":"My Cats Nick and Nora","review":"Anyone who has children and cats should easily relate to the tribulations of Nick and Nora, two much put-upon felines who somehow are able endure regular humiliation at the hands of two well-intentioned little girls who, fortunately, are oblivious to the frayed nerves of their furry playmates. My daughter loves the great pictures of the cats and their expressions of exasperation and disgust. It is not at all unusual to see the same expressions on our own persecuted kitties, sometimes only minutes later, as a result of Helen's carryings on. This book never fails to bring a smile to my face."},{"Title":"My Cats Nick and Nora","review":"A book this wonderful should never go out of print -- but yes, it's out of print so buy one quick!

It's also out of print now -- grab a copy while you can. (We have the other Harper/Moser book in this little series, \\"My Dog Rosie\\", but we don't like it quite as much.

Thanking you Harold Flinn"},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"The title, \\"Secret Soldiers: the Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception\\", by Philip Gerard, is a bit misleading. This is the story of the 23rd Special Troops, a battalion sized organization stood up to pioneer American efforts in camouflage, cover, and deception operations. While the stories presented by Gerard are fascinating, yet it fails to paint an accurate or complete picture of US Army deception operations.Gerard does an excellent job of portraying the heroic accomplishments of the men who served in the 23 Special Troops. Their job in the war was to make armies appear where they were not and to make armies not appear where they were. They accomplished this through the use of inflatable decoys, painting techniques, and sonic deception. As an example of this, the 23rd had the ability to place an inflatable 155mm howitzer in a position to make it look real. They would paint the ground to simulate the flash burns that would appear on the ground after a real weapon fired. So the unit would emplace the decoy and then use pyrotechnics, sonic deception, and simulated radio traffic to make the Germans think it was a real weapon emplacement. This book chronicles how the 23rd supported many operations in the drive across Europe. The book's strength is in describing how the tactical level efforts of the 23rd fit into the overall operation.On the negative side, there are a lot of loose connections made by the author. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, was a dashing actor in the 1930s and 1940s. Like many of his peers, he did his patriotic duty and joined the Navy. Gerard documents Fairbanks' revolutionary work with \\"sonic deception\\" used in conjunction with amphibious operations. Gerard includes a vignette about Fairbanks' unsolicited presentations to the War department in 1942. The reader may assume that Fairbanks was the one responsible for the creation of the 23 Special Troops. A chapter later, he writes \\"But in April 1942, [Julian] Sollohub was ordered to select a cadre from the 84th [Engineer Camouflage Battalion] and form a new battalion at Fort Meade.\\" Apparently, the Army was thinking about these ideas well before Fairbanks presented his findings the following October.\\"Secret Soldiers\\" does a great job of chronicling the contributions of 23rd Special Troops, and Gerard should be commended for his great work in this area. Overall the book is very good, but however interesting the story is about Fairbanks, it appears to be completely unrelated to the unit history.If you are interesting in learning more about deception operations during World War II, I also highly recommend Anthony Cave Brown's \\"Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day\\" for a far more complete picture on the \`Heroic Army of Deception' that supported the D-Day invasion of Normandy.This review is from a first edition hardback copy of the book published in 2002."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"This is a really interesting book. Intriguing in every sense, and difficult to put down once you start reading. Some really great portraits of creative, resourceful people."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I am an admittedly biased reviewer, as I have a strong affinity to the events set forth in Mr. Gerard's book. My father, MSG Robert C. MacFarland, served in H&S Co, 603rd Engineer (Camouflage) Battalion. He never spoke of his wartime service, except in a few humerous ancedotes while he purportedly served in infantry, armored, airborne, and engineer units. Having read this book I now see that he was being truthful, albeit in a deceptive fashion. The only point of mild critism is that I wish more maps had been included, showing the positions of the various elements of the 23rd during the disparate and separate operations throughout the ETO. My personal thanks to Philip Gerard for a very fine book."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I couldn't even begin to read this book. Although this product matched the appearance as described on Amazon.com, nowhere was it mentioned about the distinctive odor. The odor from the book was toxic. It smelled worse than a 20-year old ashtray. Not only was I not able to read the book, just being in proximity gave me a headache. I was not allowed leave it in my house. I even tried to seal it in plastic. I ended up throwing it away.I am very disappointed that the vendor (Joan's Collections) even shipped the book. I would like to pursue a full refund. I recommend that you suspend this vendor (Joan's Collections) from doing any further business on Amazon.com. This was not a mistake. No one could have shipped this book without knowing the level of toxicity.I demand a full refund on both the price of the book and the shipping from Joan's Collections.I do look forward to reading this book one day."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I generally have little interest in military stories, but this book is exceptional. I can't recommend it too highly. I had trouble working last week because my reading hours ran long.The 23rd Headquarters Special Troops makes for a great story to begin with. This specialized and highly secret unit of guys put on \\"shows\\" throughout the Allied campaign from Normandy into Germany with inflatable tanks, stereo broadcasts over the countryside of moving tanks and equipment (where nothing was moving but show-people), and pyrotechnic light shows -- all designed to cover up weak spots in the Allied line, tie up German divisions where they were ineffectual, and to draw attention away from actual troop movements.But who do you round up to do such work? For camoufleurs you need artists, including a guy who's spent years studying how birds blend into their habitat; for producing \\"shows\\" you need scriptwriters and other show people. Fashion designer Bill Blass was involved. The antithesis of gung-ho Army grunts became a unit that saved untold numbers of lives. The interplay of contrasting styles between unconventional creative artists and career Army officers is captivating. Yet, for the most part, they all made it work. You get a sense of even the men themselves shaking their heads in wonder.Philip Gerard's writerly craft brings much to the story. The book is arranged chronologically, introducing the various players and their training before following them to England and through the operations in Europe. Early on, certain readers might find some of the technical detail a bit much, but later when the action cranks up overseas we understand exactly what's going on and appreciate the careful preparation. We know the characters, their personalities and their functions, and we know the hardware, so the stories flow during the cross-country race toward Berlin. And the technical matters are delivered through warmly human stories throughout the book, profiles of unlikely heroes, men thrown into circumstances that demanded more than they knew they had in them.Gerard's meticulous and wide-ranging research -- and surely some luck as well -- are plainly evident, not only in the stories but in the extensive notes, bibliography, and index. There is far more to the book than I can say here without giving away too much. Read it."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"My last 40 months in the Army (1996 - 2000) were spent at Ft. Drum, New York. While there I soon learned that such well known divisions as the 45th Infantry Division and Patton's famous 4th Armored Division trained there before shipping out for combat in Europe. What I also learned about was a signal corp unit which did top secret or &quot;hush-hush&quot; work. Unfortunately there wasn't much else in the way of information. When I was there I heared that the surviving members of the unit had a reunion and that an author was researching for a book. I made a mental note to look for the book, but after a couple of years forgot.Well this year for Fathers Day my seven year old daughter bought Secret Soldiers for me. It's a great read. It keeps your attention and shines a light on a part of the war effort that has been dark until recently. No these men did not engage the enemy in hand to hand combat, sieze a vital target or hold out for several days against overwhelming odds. What these men did is harder to measure in those terms. But their contributions were important in so many ways. This is a well researched book and also well written. Those two things don't always go together. The author goes technical just enough so one can understand exactly how the various operations worked and he also explains how these soldiers and their ruses could lead the Germans to deploying their forces where they shouldn't have.If for no other reason this book should give one an appreciation for the pioneering efforts in developing speakers and tape recorders. One could argue this unti is the reason why we now have compact discs. But it should also give one a sense of appreciation for those soldiers who served in ways other then on the front line in a foxhole."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I picked up this book expecting one thing, and got another. The Hardback version ~seems~ to promise an overall history of Deception Warfare in WWII, the most famous of which is probably &quot;Fortitude&quot; - the deception of Rommel into believing Patton would lead the D-Day forces to Calais, closely followed in general public awareness by the story of &quot;The Man who Never Was&quot;.Well, while these are indeed touched on, they're not dealt with in depth. What you get in its place, however, is admirable. The story of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops is a great one - ESSENTIAL, I'd say, because it helps open your eyes to the activites of US Army &quot;support&quot; Units, which you must know to have a well rounded view of WW II.As I've said in another review on the 3AD's WW II Maintenance Operations (Deathtraps), most books on the War in Europe give the view from the Foxhole or the View from HQ, with little said about the activities of other units, which were just as important to the success of the overall campaign.The Good Points of this book:- Needed light shown on a unfamiliar topic- Great attention to the detail in portraying the individual work of the units of the 23rd(Camofleur ops with Dummy vehicles &amp; Encampments, Sonic Operations, Radio Spoofing, etc), and how that work evolved and improved over the course of their operations- Great attention to the personalities of the men who made up the unit. An unlikely mix of combat men, artists, showmen and techies who found a way to work together against the enemy and upon occasion, shortsighted leadership. Whoda' thunk Bill Blass or Douglas Fairbanks Jr. played such roles in WWII? The 2000 reunion at the end of the book was effectively recountedThings I wish were better:- The cover blurbs promise more than the book really aims to deliver. Probably more a marketing thing than the authors true intent, which was primarily the 23rd. However, I still wish the Author could have talked about Fortitude, and if/how the 23rd learned anything from the operation- As another reviewer noted, we learn a lot about Douglas Fairbanks Jr's naval deception experience - a lot more than we learn about Fortitude, in fact. While this was welcome information, I would have preferred it to be covered in either a larger book about all WW II Decpeption OPs, or edited out of this book, where its a bit less relevant.- The disorganized nature of the 23rd, which was really cobbled together from separate units, and their loose affiliations in the field, make for difficult history telling. The author does not always make it clear how the units worked together, and how they did not. A &quot;chain of command&quot; diagram would have been much appreciatedI do recommend this book. I think it could have used a bit more editing and could have been shorter, but the enthusiasm of the author for the material shines through, as does the depth of his research. The story is a great one, and the book is well worth purchasing for anyone seeking a well rounded view of WWII."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"As an amateur history buff dabbling in several different periods, I found this book to be a very interesting read on a small but very important unit that arguably contributed greatly to the final year of the war.This book gets into the technical details just enough to let the reader understand the basics of the various deceptions the units \\"played\\" without bogging the book down. Its strength is painting a whole picture of how the unit formed, the key leaders that made the unit successful, the unusual mix (for the Army) of artists that had the initiative and innovation to pull off their deceptions, the daily routines for the enlisted men, and of course the various operations that were conducted.Well balanced between interviews with the actual soldiers and the facts of the operations while setting the scene of what wartime Europe was like during their short deployment, Gerard has done a great service in documenting the unit's once top-secret history."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"This is a great story about a company of soldiers who brought deception to WWII for America. Mush of the story was kept classified until the last few years (although the author never tells us why or when it was declassified). Unfortunately, the book is poorly organized.The author also gets bogged down in minutae which often is not relevant to the story or just plain uninteresting. The book is at its best when it steps back and looks at the big picture of this small company or is describing the methodology it used. Those parts are too thin in the book.Also, the author tries to walk the tightrope of relating a very specialized aspect of the US Army in WWII while at the same time attempting to put that small aspect into the overall. Thus the reader gets two sentence analyses of major events, which are often insultingly simplistic. One would expect that if a reader is going to pick up this book devoted to one company, he would know the general aspects of the war.Many of the characters are compelling as are the battles (for lack of a better word for the activities of deception troops) in which they contributed. The technology is also interesting. I think this would have been a much better book had it been 100 pages shorter.It also could have been improved if the author did not gush so over Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. The amount of space devoted to him in the opening chapter is disproportionate to the role this Navy man in the US Army deception comapny. An example of the author's obsession with Fairbanks and the unorganized nature of this book is seen when, in the middle of a long chapter on the deception techniques the company is using France on its way to Germany, the author breaks in with a two page update on what Fairbanks was doing at the time -- in the Mediterranean and in the Navy and nothing to do with deception!!! Nothing at all to do with what was going on in the 75 pages before and after. A glaring example of the superfluous and disorganization running through the book.I wish I could recommend this because of teh great accomplishments of those described in this book. Unfortunately, it is a long hard journey to get from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I commend Mr. Gerard for bringing this amazing story to print. It should be required reading by all students and buffs of WWII history. It is an excellent story and well told.This book is about the 23d Headquarters Special Troops; a group of actors, artists and skilled illusionists that became soldiers in one of America's most secret outfits of WWII. Not until 1979 were any of them permitted to openly tell of their exploits during the war.The book begins with the concept of using deception in warfare and carries forward through examples in various battles. It then tells of the birth of this deceptive warfare unit and the men instrumental in its formation. Among them Douglas Fairbanks Jr.The sections on the formation of the various units, Sonic Deception, Camouflage, Radio etc, explain the importance of using these techniques in combat. Battle plans are \\"scripted\\" and the soldiers are \\"actors.\\" But what the reader comes away with is the knowledge that these artists and actors, in doing their jobs, became frontline combat soldiers. To insure their success, missions frequently were kept secret from the other soldiers in the area. Many times they purposely drew enemy fire into their formations of \\"rubber\\" tanks, and artillery pieces so that the real weapons and soldiers could move to a new position undetected.Mr. Gerard sprinkles through out the book, reflections from the surviving members of this unit. And finishes the book at a small reunion of the dwindling number of veterans of the 23rd Special Troops, reminding me so much of the reunions I've attended of my father's 29th Infantry Division and the awe of being in the company of heroes.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and hated the moments I had to put it down.I'm not a fan of war stories but this book was different.

I'd recommend it for your home library if your a war buff and have true history interests."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"While this book had many fascinating points, especially the psychological effects of deception, there was way too much discussion of unrelated details, such as the \\"bare-ass naked cook\\" rollerskating. Gerard could have made the book half this length, including only details of the missions and a brief history, not 150 pages outlining eachn soldier's personal backround and if the ate steak rare or well-done. Overall interseting, but absolutely not a page turner. Only about 50% of the book is truly worth reading, the rest is irrelevant and boring."},{"Title":"Secret Soldiers: The Story of World War II's Heroic Army of Deception","review":"I was expecting a book concentrating on how the military cleverly used deception (camoflage, sound effects, props and acting) during the war. What I got was too much a story of how bad the war was (the war was bad, being a soldier was bad, the officers were bad... ). While it's important to remember the horror of war that is for a different book, even if the horrors are displayed in the form of personal recollections. I accept the set up where the nature of the soldiers in this special unit was explained, but towards the end it really dragged as it carried on long after the end of the units active participation in the war.Needed more focus on the use and effectiveness of deception at war and less on inidividual's recollections of unrelated events."},{"Title":"A Vittorini Omnibus: In Sicily, the Twilight of the Elephant (New Directions Book)","review":"ELIO VITTORINI IS A NOVELIST WHO WRITES LIKE A GOOD POET.

Fearing he will turn into a \\"Wanker\\", Andrew seeks money that equates to happiness. Andrew answers an Evening Standard ad for male escorts, hoping to land a &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;.Andrew escorts the wealthy, decadent and older Marion. She and her nasty friends turn him into her boy toy. He likes the expensive cars he now drives, the excess \\"green\\" he carries, the weekend flights across the Atlantic, and the other trinkets she buys him, However, he soon feels his esteem battered when he meets shop assistant plain Jane. She likes the potential she sees in him, but is disappointed in how weak he is by allowing the Rolex crowd to buy his soul. To his shock, Andrew cannot get Jane out of his head and realizes he must decide whether he wants love or money.Andrew will remind readers of Alfie as he seems as shallow and morally void yet somehow empathetic and understandable. His struggle to select between debauched luxury and love leads the audience to hope he will properly choose, but not wait too long because Jane will not sit around moping. There is a vast contrast between Marion and her jet set minions who contain no redeeming qualities as opposed to the nurturing be all you can be Jane. This extreme also keeps the options simplistic as it boils down to selling your soul vs. loving another's soul. This is a terrific character study that if Marion was a wee nicer could have been UPGRADED into quite a complex tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright's Lost Buildings (Wright at a Glance Series)","review":"&quot;Frank Lloyd Wright's Lost Buildings,&quot; by Carla Lind, is one of a series of &quot;mini-books&quot; dedicated to the work of this legendary architect.

London went on to &quot;earn his manhood spurs&quot; through hard drinking at the steamy waterfront bars on the San Francisco Bay. Claiming never to have acquired a taste for the stuff, London stresses the important role of the saloon in cultivating alcoholism in young men. He brings to vivid life the romantic allure of a place full of sailors with names like Whiskey Bob, whose stories of 'round-the-world journeys, barroom brawls, and dangerous sea adventures mingled with the &quot;comaraderie of drink.&quot; At once a highly personal work of intense emotional power and an unsparing social commentary on the evils of drink, this masterpiece of autobiographical literature first stunned a world audience in 1913, and today continues to strike a resounding contemporary note."},{"Title":"John Barleycorn, or, Alcoholic memoirs","review":"The novelist and adventurer Jack London was an alcoholic at an early age. This colorful memoir -- one of the first in America to treat the issue of alcohol abuse -- was written to encourage the prohibition efforts of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. London does condemn the overuse of alcohol, but his barroom tales make an equally strong case for its allure. The emphasis London places on the reasons why people drink, and drink to excess, fills this book with exciting characters and locales -- \\"the cameraderie of drink\\" is London's own phrase, as another reviewer notes. This personal revelation by one of America's premier adventure writers must have been shocking to a nation that viewed its drunks with a fairly tolerant eye. It is certainly an important book for those interested in the literature of alcohol abuse in this country."},{"Title":"John Barleycorn, or, Alcoholic memoirs","review":"...for continuing to sell these wretched \\"General Books LLC\\" editions.

Maxey Walton","review":"There's a lot of emphasis on eternal security in today's Christian culture, but can an individual lose one's salvation? What about the Scriptures where Jesus talks about spewing church members out of His mouth? What about warnings that unless certain changes were made there would be dire consequences? Is there another side to the coin? Can a person who was once saved eventually not make it to heaven?In this well-reasoned little book, J. Maxey Walton argues that one can lose one's salvation. He starts with the analogy of being \\"born again\\" and explains that just because one is born spiritually into a family does not mean one cannot return to evil and become a son of folly. He also argues that Judas was one of the \\"sheep\\" Jesus sent to the world at one point, but this particular \\"sheep\\" did not make it to the kingdom of heaven. He goes on to point out the warning of the branch that does not bear fruit that is fit for nothing but to be cut off from the vine.The author says I John 1:7 is to be interpreted that if one \\"walks in the light\\" as a continual process, he will be saved, but it isn't guaranteed without the continuation of the process. Regardless of which side of the issue you find yourself, I think this book will challenge you to ask if you're right and examine the Scriptures more closely."},{"Title":"The turns of time","review":"This is the oldest, and in my opinion, the best of Audemars' books featuring his very 1960s Parisian detective. Monsieur Pinaud. But I've only read half of the total, perhaps there are more jewels like this. Here is the first paragraph:\\"In the days when M. Pinaud's fame had grown even greater than the credulity of his listeners (which is not a statement to be lightly dismissed) he would stress the point, not once but many times, that the great detective must know something about everything.\\"This book is lovingly overwritten. Its main character is improbable even by the standards of Paris detectives invented by British writers. He is, in a distant way, related to Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. But Sellers' character is one you laugh at, while admiring his joie de vivre, perhaps. M. Pinaud is made of rather sterner stuff. a VERY serious man, a devoted husband, a large, capable man, wearing heavy shoes, armed with a pistol when one is needed. He has great patience, and the disposition of a philosopher. In short, the man who walks the mean streets but who himself is not mean. Who is as good as any man, better than many, honest and trustworthy. A person of the sort we would all live happier lives if there were more of. (I'm rehashing Chandler's \\"Simple Art of Murder\\" summary here, go look it up.) Pinaud is such a man. But also funny, as Nick and Nora Charles, or Chandler's fellow who talks they way Jane Austin writes...Here he is speaking to the parents of the young hoodlum ('tude, motorcycle jacket, greasy hair) whom he works with, undercover, at a jewelery store. A pure Officer Krupke moment is available, but Audumars has higher ambitions for his story and his characters: (The mother is speaking)\\"...he has grown into a stranger. We never see him. He treats this place like a hotel, and not like a home-\\"\\"But, Madame\\", interrupted M. Pinaud, gravely, \\"that is perfectly normal in a boy of nineteen-\\"\\"No, M'sieu. When I was nineteen, I would not have dared,\\" put in M. Reymond.M. Pinaud turned to him courteously.\\"Naturally, M'sieu, but you were nineteen some forty years ago. This is another generation-\\"\\"A pretty poor one-\\"\\"It is the one we ourselves have created-\\"Nothing is particularly original here but its beautifully made and always engaging. There's a real, human, warmth to this occasionally daydreaming but always alive detective, in his cloud of acrid French cigarette smoke, stoically enduring the abuse of the bus driver he nearly collides with...And reflecting Audimars' actual experience as a jeweler, there are marvelous bits of jewelry store business, the best, a set piece of two aged sisters who return the watch they purchased 3 months before because it is now 6 minutes fast. They have never re-set it, only wound it, leaving setting to the experts... those of you who have always owned electronic watches will have to take this on faith:'It was many months before he could forget that nightmare conversation, every word of which seemed to sear itself in his memory- The one at the counter addressing herself to him, the one in the chair referring to him always in the third person, as if he were not present or did not exist.\\"Now that is why we are here. We have come to complain.\\"\\"That is right. Tell him we have come to complain-\\" from the chair.\\"It was not a cheap watch-\\"\\"He knew all the time we did not want a cheap watch-\\"\\"You told us it was a good watch-\\"\\"Yes, that is what he said-\\"'\\"And that a good watch would keep good time-\\"\\"He said it would keep good time-\\"'It gets better, and goes for quite some time. Other trying customers appear, as M. Pinaud seeks to find the killer of the watchmaker who was found dead, just as he arrived to protect a set of diamonds belonging to emigres who fled the Russian Revolution. At first, his interest is only in the death, a concrete fact, not some vague fears about old jewelery that might be worth a fortune... if it exists... but the two strands pull the story along and M. Pinaud wins the day, murky as things become near the end. as you know he will.I must have read this the first time about 30 years ago. I enjoyed it as much again as it completely captivated my son when I read it to him about 3 or 4 years ago.Some suggestive situation are refered to, and a certain amount of bad behavior occurs off-stage, but the language is light and mild, as the samples above suggest. Suitable for ages 10 and up unless you keep the kid away from TV and newspapers too.This is the real deal, and although I've never been a detective, or worked in a jewelery store, it has the ring of truth. I recommend it."},{"Title":"InuYasha, Vol. 13","review":"If you've been following the love triangle in Inuyasha, this one will strike another conflict among the threes. Kagome almost got killed by Kikyou in the book and that gave Inuyasha a very uncomfortable feeling. Of course, Inuyasha wanted to be with Kagome, however, he still couldn't bare leaving Kikyou on her own after all those things b/w him and her in the past. I gave this book 5 stars because this is touching emotionally."},{"Title":"InuYasha, Vol. 13","review":"This volume has the rest of the Kikyou plot that was left off in book 12. It also has the third fight between Sesshomaru and Inuyasha where Inuyasha learns a new ability with his sword. Toutousai, who forged Tetsusaiga, appears in this book to bug Inuyasha and, of course, our favorite little toad, Jaken (note the sarcasm) appears as Sesshomaru's 'faithful' minion.

It's non-sexual. It's just a girl taking a bath. A reminder that in Japan, showing nudity in comics or on cartoons is just typical.

I highly recommend them: they are error-free (a major problem in the deluge of Austen compilations), high quality (good binding - firm enough to last, but pliable enough to actual read the book without having to crack the spine; pages are of a quality weight paper), the book size is also manageable. I own both volumes, have read through them repeatedly, and am glad to have finally found a quality set."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Jane Austen is still where she belongs, between book covers. We know the stories are good, but what isn't immediately obvious is the many recent adaptations is what an impeccable writer of English prose she is - no posturing word-dropper, no purveyer of hoary terminology, but a fine, simple, straightforward narrator.She is brief but telling, using tilt and tone to make us smile. She doesn't bore with tedious flashbacks or podding descriptions of a new character's background. And she tells us what we wanted to know, just when we want to know it. As I am wondering what became of Mr. Bingley, he turns up; as I am trying to remember what the party is doing in Bath, it becomes clear. She's always ahead, dropping just the right number of crumbs.Jane's world moved slowly, and reading her takes time. Her cncerns are universal - how to fill the hours of the day, the pairing of single young men and women, the effects of money, household matters. Her ethical domain is dominated by consideration - of others' feelings, needs, requirements. The occasional rebellious spirit is not admired, concepts such as fulfillment and freedom never enter her head. As for &quot;needs&quot; beyond basic physical ones - an idea that would have astonished her - she would have substituted &quot;obligations.&quot;But there is something about all this that keeps us going back, and back and back."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"This hardback is a solid binding on good quality paper. It easily stands up to the many re-readings Austen's novels deserve."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Not sure if you want to read a Jane Austen novel after seeing the movie based on her book? I can only speak for myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading these novels. It became clear to me upon reading these timeless tales of human relationships why Hollywood has been feverishly adapting Austen's stories for film. These stories never lose their relevance! Austen had a way of portraying the eccentricities and weaknesses of human nature in a gentle but honest fashion. The heros and heroines in these novels are witty, amusing and endearingly flawed as they blunder their way along to true happiness, though never quite in the way they imagine. This collection of her novels is a well-loved and worthy addition to my permanent collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"This review is not for the novels of Jane Austen, rather for the item offered here on amazon.comMuch to my surprise, after I ordered &quot;The Complete Novels of Jane Austen (Modern Library Series)&quot; ISBN 0679600264, only one book arrived. As pictured above, Vol I contains S&amp;S, P&amp;P, and MP.The other three novels must be in Vol II, you surmise? Wrong! THAT IS ALL YOU GET !Apparently, &quot;complete&quot; is a relative term, meaning &quot;half of&quot;. At best, this listing shows ignorance. At worst, this listing is fraud."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"I assume anyone buying the complete works of an author is already a fan, so I'll leave out the review of the stories themselves and focus on the book as physical objects. The superficial side of me likes the way these two volumes look on my book shelves. They don't take up too much space and yet have presence. As a reader, I also found the books to be comfortable to hold (and I generally don't like hardbacks) and compact enough to fit in my not-enormous purse. The binding doesn't crack and the paper and font are easy on the eyes.This isn't the cheapest Jane Austen compilation you'll find, but given that I've already gone through multiple copies of Pride and Prejudice, I think the price is offset by the quality. These books will stand up to heavy use."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Now that Jane Austen's work has made it onto the big screen in a big way, the myth that her novels merely dealt with the niceties of social interaction in the early nineteenth century is being blown clean away. Her novels are a world in miniature, but a brutal world that left women at the mercy of men for their fortunes and misfortunes. Take for instance the start of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;: the head of the household dies, leaving his wife and daughters dependent on the goodwill of his son from a previous marriage. The son's good intentions are shorn away in a cutting dialogue between him and his wife until what he gives his step-family will keep them only in genteel poverty. Small wonder then that the often-quoted start of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is so loaded with irony--a rich husband was a catch indeed for he could save you and your loved ones from poverty. Despite the grim circumstances of her novels and their often claustrophobic atmosphere, Jane Austen's wit gives her work a deceptive lightness. Her work may be about women struggling to survive in a world that tried to keep them on the margins but it has all the sharpness and pace to ensure her books have been read for over 150 years."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single reader in possession of a large admiration for Jane Austen and her works must be desirous of reading all of them. Whether you never before have had the chance to meet Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, or return again and again to visit your good friend Elizabeth Bennet, the _Complete Novels of Jane Austen_ (Modern Library Series) Volume I presents a delightful way to make new acquaintances and renew old ones. In this collection, _Sense and Sensibility_, _Pride and Prejudice_ and _Mansfield Park_ immediately engage you in the trials and triumphs of Elinor and Marianne, Elizabeth and her sisters, and Fanny Price. The compact, pleasant volume makes the very act of reading a joy. Uncluttered and elegant, like Jane Austen's prose, this edition allows the stories to shine for themselves. You will cry with Marianne, search your own heart with Elizabeth, and suffer with Fanny. Alive with wit and humor, Jane Austen's novels will provoke your thoughts and lighten your heart. When you finish Volume I of this marvelous edition, nothing will do but to read Volume II."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"I purchased this for my SIL's Christmas present along with the second volume.

The price was great and qualified for free shipping. I can't wait to give them to my SIL because she's a huge Austen fan and loves to collect classic books. I think these will make a nice addition to her bookshelf and keep her entertained for years to come."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"I wanted to write this so others can be assisted when ordering, as it can be confusing. When searching for the 'complete novels' of Jane Austen, Volume I of The Modern Library comes up readily, but it only contains three novels, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park. The description does not seem to mention that there is a Volume II, even though one would assume so, as there is a Volume I...So one might think one has the complete novels when in fact only three arrive. I happened to see both volumes at a book store and was then searching for them online. In order to get Volume II, one really has to put it in the search as Volume II, then it will show up, and it contains Emma, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. I looked at several editions of the complete novels, but The Modern Library convinced me with the good readable font and sturdy hard cover, I really like the whole layout a lot, I think it will give enjoyment for years to come, can be read and reread without falling apart. Even in the era of the e-reader I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"A decades-long fan of Jane Austen, I finally broke down and ordered my own set rather than borrowing from the library. Now, I can take it anywhere.No bigger or heavier than many other current popular novels - and smaller than many - it offers great light classical reading. Easy to read and well-bound, each of the two volumes in the set includes three of Austen's novels.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"This is an EXCELLENT collection of Jane Austen's novels. Yes, when buying it, my brother and I chuckled over the irony of \\"The Complete Novels... Volume I,\\" but neither of us was silly enough to think we were immune from having to also purchase Volume II in order to have the Complete Novels. If you are looking for quality at a reasonable price, this is the collection to buy. These books are exceptionally well made, and the type and paper quality are well above average.Volume I Review:I originally read Volume I years ago after having first seen the television and movie adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I recently decided to re-read this volume and was even more enraptured with it than I was during the first read. The plight of the Dashwood sisters and the malleability of their step-brother by his cold wife in Sense and Sensibility is made so vivid by Jane Austen's flawless writing. What girl or woman reading Pride and Prejudice doesn't imagine she is Elizabeth Bennet, with both her beauty and intelligence, inadvertantly making Mr. Darcy fall in love with her? My heart positively ached for Fanny Price in Mansfield Park, and I wondered how she could put up with the neglect of her rich, fancy relatives and the tyranny of her Aunt Norris and maintain such a pure heart. I am awed by the timelessness and reality of these novels. In my mind, it simply does not get any better than Jane Austen.Volume II Review:I also recently finished re-reading Volume II. Jane Austen's novels certainly do transcend time. Whenever I read them I am struck by some new truth applicable either to my life or life today in general. What was true about human nature approximately 200 years ago remains true today, which makes relating to and understanding Jane Austen so easy as well as gratifying.Like the heroine in Emma, who hasn't known a spoiled brat whose natural vanity is the result of being blessed in everything? Emma's superior attitude is a bit galling at times, and I positively cringed at some of her blunders, but Emma has a good heart. She makes mistakes, like we all do, but eventually she begins to understand her errors through the help of her good friend Mr. Knightly. Thank goodness for friends who love us in spite of our imperfections!In Northanger Abbey, I am tickled to death not only by Catherine's naivete but also by Jane Austen herself. The first half of this novel is filled with the most hilarious observations which seem to come directly from Austen, and the second half is filled with the overactive imagination of Catherine Morland, who has read perhaps too many novels. In this parody of Gothic fiction, Austen pokes fun at both herself and her audience. It is truly a delight.When I first read Jane Austen in my mid-twenties, Persuasion was my favorite novel. It gave me hope. I felt so strongly for Anne Elliot, who at nineteen was convinced by her family to reject the man she loved because of his lack of rank and fortune. Seven years later, after he has acheived his fortune, she is thrown into this same man's company. She must watch, agonizingly, while he courts two other young ladies. Anne's courage and fortitude are inspiring."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"This book was a gift for my wife. A favorite of hers, this is 3 complete books in one.

She had been wanting to read Pride & Prejudice awhile. It's a bit thick but it contains 3 good books."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor. \\"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen, Vol. 1 (Sense & Sensibility / Pride & Prejudice / Mansfield Park)\\" brings together three of her best, filled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" have very different interests when the Dashwood family is exiled from their home, and are reduced to living in a tiny cottage. The eldest daughter, sensible Elinor, has fallen in love with a shy scholarly man who will never be permitted to marry her, and the romantic Marianne has fallen for sexy bad-boy Willoughby. But a trip to London exposes the secrets of both men, and jeopardizes the romantic lives of both sisters.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" clash when Elizabeth Bennett encounters the handsome, aloof, absurdly wealthy Mr. Darcy. However, her prejudice against him builds up when she befriends the charming Wickham (who claims to have been wronged by Darcy), and Darcy sabotages a love-match for Lizzie's sister. But she soon discovers that he's not THAT bad -- especially when a massive scandal hits her family, and Darcy may be the only one who can help.\\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park. Edmund seems to be in love with Miss Crawford, while Mr. Crawford has taken a fancy to both Fanny and her married cousin Maria.Jane Austen had a rare talent for depicting human nature, and creating a sense of drama and tension without becoming melodramatic. Each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit.Despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (Darcy's efforts to help Lizzie's family, AFTER she rejects him).Austen also had an interesting range of heroines, and each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness. Lizzie is a smart, witty, slightly naive young woman with a kind heart, and Darcy is shown to be much the same; Elinor is a quiet \\"sensible\\" girl who wants a guy just like her, and Marianne is a raving romantic who becomes acquainted with real love and heartbreak. The one downside: Fanny Price, who comes across as very dull and passive.\\"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen, Vol. 1 (Sense & Sensibility / Pride & Prejudice / Mansfield Park)\\" brings together three of these romantic, often biting classics."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"I have been wanting to read these books for some time, and they are absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"The works of Jane Austen included in this volume are clever critiques of the social norms and mores of Austen's day. Unlike other such critiques, however, Jane Austen's novels make enjoyable reading even for those used to more modern novels. Her characters' romances are perhaps less steamy than those the modern reader is accustomed to, but Austen's characters are well-rounded and sympathetic, and no one can deny the satisfaction of her happy endings. All in all, Austen's novels well deserve to be called &quot;classics.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Combining all six novels into one volume, gives the reader easy access to all of Jane Austen's work. My favorite of these books is Pride and Predjudice. It is filled with subtle humor and a very good plot."},{"Title":"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen Volume 1-3","review":"Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is, through written long ago, a timeless tale of truth and human beings. It is a truly comical story, with an uncomical moral as genuine and universal as it was when in the eighteenth century. It's characters shall always remain among the most beloved in literature."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero.","review":"Ludwig Moyzisch tells his true story almost like a novel for reality here surpasses fiction. From October 28, 1943 until April 1944, Nazi Germany did get from the spy \\"Cicero\\" an inside view of the series of Allied conferences. These conference were sealing Nazi Germany's fate and the one of its leaders at Moscow (Cordell Hull, Anthony Eden, Molotov), in Cairo (F. D. Roosevelt, W. Churchill, Chiang kai-Shek), and in Tehran (F. D. Roosevelt, W. Churchill, Stalin). They were also sealing the fate of millions of human beings trying to prevent them of sliding in the communist iron fist which had already started enslaving and killing more innocent people than the nazis themselves ever would.Cicero was personally handled by the author of the book, an attache at the German Embassy in Ankara (Turkey), who was paying the photos rolls (of documents from the British Ambassador's safe) for enormous sums.. in counterfeit Sterling Pounds. Contrary to the author's opinion, Cicero's photostats were taken very seriously in Berlin as, in December 1943, Hitler entered a conference with some of them stating that he knew for sure that the Allies would land in France by the end of the spring. He even knew the codename Overlord. Fortunately he didn't know the details.Moyzisch is trying to hide that he was not a diplomatic public servant but an employee of Walter Schellenberg the young star of the Amt VI of the nazi RSHA (head office of the Gestapo: its Amt IV) heading German political espionage and personally advising Himmler, the architect of the genocide of Jewish people. The facts however are otherwise delivered in a very lively manner, making a thriller of the book. Actually the story is so fascinating that, in 1952, Mankiewicz shot it in a film called \\"5 fingers\\", starring James Mason and Danielle Darrieux. It was a huge success and received several awards.Historians who tend to explain everything by the use of Ultra and Magic (the first deciphering computers) should realize that these fantastic tools, which actually helped win the war, didn't report the Allies anything about this fantastic spy case eventhough, for months, the Nazis exchanged cables after cables on the subject. For precious that these tools demonstrated to be, they didn't win the war: men sacrificing their lives did. Technology was a precious tool, but only a tool.It should also teach humility to all the historic spy-story writers, who tend to be conceited former officers of Allied secret services: the ennemy was not as stupid as they present it (or the war would not have costed so many lives) and our MI5, MI6 and COI/OSS had its share of naive high-ranking idiots, whose stupidity costed many precious lives as well.The book is short enough to remain pleasant all along, and is fascinating even for the ones who are not prone to study World War II history. For historians it is just a basic must."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero.","review":"Good, but the semi-ficionalized movie from back in the 50's is better. It fleshes out the story nicely. The book is good reading, but spotty in the description of the actual Cicero character. Cicero's revelations to the Germans could have changed the outcome of WWII, but, without confirmation, the Germans didn't believe what they were seeing. Good thing for us."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero.","review":"This book is from the German official who dealt with \\"Cicero\\", the British spy in the Turkish embassy. It gives more and more accurate information than the movie starring James Mason as Cicero. The movie is the best WWII spy movie I've ever seen, but the book is even better. The movie is the same story from the British side. Anyone interested in true drama should read this one."},{"Title":"Operation Cicero.","review":"Herr Moyzisch,self portrayed gentleman in a scheming world, orcunning diplomat in a scheming world?I suspect a bit of both, with a healthy dose of self preservationto boot.Written in German,translated into English, the tension expressedis remarkable on its own.&quot;Kaltenbrunner gave me a piercing vicious look.Every muscle of his heavily scarred face was tense.I would not,at that moment,have fancied him as an enemy.&quot;When did that signal leave Ankara?&quot;He almost shouted the question.&quot; pg 89Its 1943 ,your a lowly Attache, and your getting quizzed bya man dressed in black leather,head to jackboot.And its no dream!Yea,Herr Moyzisch was packing bricks,nooo doubt!So find out how this man receives potential Axis victory information,how the German Highcommand dont use it,and what thoseguys are really like when it all goes to custard.And the best thing.Its all true!"},{"Title":"braude's treasury of wit and humor","review":"This book is a great source for humor.Jacob Braude was a Judge of the Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois for more than 35 years. During that time, he gained a reputation for his reservoir of anecdotes and humorous stories.The book is divided into topics and the material is easily adaptable. I particularly like the definitions, which I find are a great source for humorous one-liners."},{"Title":"braude's treasury of wit and humor","review":"In the modern world of coarse humor, jokes are often expected to be crude and contain expletives or sexual references. However, not all audiences can be exposed to such outbursts and in those circumstances, one must use a joke that is good, clean and will not offend any group in the audience. While the jokes in this book are clean, there are many that will offend people, in particular women.Many of the jokes are based on dated clich&eacute;s about women. Some examples are:Hypochondriac - a woman who always broods over her health, but never catches a remedy.Eavesdropper - a woman who loves to listen in, but not as much as she loves to talk out.Adam - the first white slave.Therefore, while this book is a good source for jokes that can be used in front of an audience, one must be careful to make sure that you take them through at least some kind of data correction filter. While these jokes were considered appropriate forty years ago, many of them have not aged well and are sure to offend some of the audience members."},{"Title":"braude's treasury of wit and humor","review":"My very intelligent twelve year old loves this book. She finds it to be very entertaining, but I appreciate the fact that it is also somewhat educational. It is well written (although perhaps a bit dated) and it's funny, but uses a bit of an advanced vocabulary that exposes my daughter to a higher level of words (& concepts) than she generally encounters in today's dumbed down world. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The story of the Armory show","review":"I bought this book to use as a reference for a lecture I was asked to give about the Armory Show. The book is beautiful. It was listed as used, but it looks like new. Even the dust jacket. the pictures are wonderful. There are more of them than in the copy of the book I borrowed from the university library. The paper seems to be of better quality, too. I used the library copy to carry around when I was working on my lecture. The copy from Amazon will be in my library for a while,and then will go to the Tampa Museum of Art library. Meanwhle, I'm starting to read it all over again, this time for pleasure."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I am not much of a romance novel reader but I really enjoyed Once and Always. There is a sad mystery that surrounds Jason Fielding that Victoria will uncover. Also, Jason Fielding has another side to him that is not arrogant, almost venerable that Victoria will come to love. I read Whitney, My Love after finishing Once and Always and found that I like Once and Always more. This is probably my favorite book from McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I don't think that this book was as good as McNaught's others. The hero was just cruel and mean to the heroine all through out the book. You don't see any warmth from the hero until towards the end of the book, which by then seems impossible that the heroine and the hero would be together forever. I'm not sure why others thought this book was romantic. I thought that the two characters were always arguing or that the hero was being cruel to the herione. I'd suggest reading Until You instead."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite romance novels. I would like to see it in Kindle format so that I can take it everywhere!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Oh I love you Jason Fielding! He is an ass in many parts, but when we see his other side it all makes up for it. When I finished this book I wanted to cry because there was no epilogue. I wanted more Miss Judith McNaught!!! Ihave gone back and reread this book because I had so much withdrawal. I read it the first time from the library, and when I returned it I immediately went out to buy my own copy. I did have some issues with him going to his mistress after they were married, but McNaught made sure to let us know it was only to relieve his ache for Victoria...lol. I saw some low ratings, and I guess I loved this so much because the hero is such an alpha male. He is mean and scary, but when we look closer, he is so much more. I felt the butterflies, the sadness, and the triumph! McNaught is one of my favorite authors. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"My God what can i say for this book? There are no words to describe it. It's the best of the best, i have read it so many times and it's still brings the same feelings just as i had read it the first time.I Love Jason and Victoria, there is no match for them.Oh,Jason what can i say is such a tortured hero and Victoria such a sweet girl that slowly heals his wounds you will love them. I have read lots of books but this one it's just Marvelous!I wish that J.M. wrote a sequel book with Jason and Victoria or an extended version of the book just like she did in Witney My love.If you want an intense and emotional love story I have one think to say JUST READ IT, PLEASE, YOU WAN'T REGRET IT TRUST ME!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"One of my all time favorite historical romances. I've read it about a 100 times, in fact, my cover is hanging off. Jason was my favorite hero, so tortured and brooding and intense, love that. I just wish the reunion scene at the end was a bit longer but still, this is a perfect book for me."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is my favorite romance novel of all times. I especially love Charles and Katherine's story inside the story. I cried every time I read it. It was so very romantic and sad at the same time. As for the main characters, I love Jason's character a lot. I think b/c of all the pain that he went through in life made him a very attractive and controversial man. I could see myself in love with the man myself. Can't wait for the story about Dorothy."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith McNaught works her magic again!! This book is heart felt and heart wrenching at the same time. I encourage everyone to read this book. Once I started reading this book, I could not seem to stop. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I will briefly comment on this story. It takes place in the early 1800's and I was hesitant to read a book about Dukes and so forth, but I truly enjoyed the story and loved the descriptive details JM provided. I really hope you enjoy this book as much as I do, and you will not regret your choice of reading this book!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"i LOVE judith mcnaught.this is a very good and sexy book loved it.i however do not like her contemporary books.they do not have enough romance at all.but this book is GREAT"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"\\"Loving someone who doesn't love you is hell! Don't let anyone every convince you that you can be happy with someone who doesn't love you. And don't ever love anyone more than you loves you.\\" Her father's words haunted the thoughts of Victoria Seaton. When her loving parents die unexpectedly, leaving Victoria and her sister orphaned, she feels like she has no place in the world. The man she loves is in Europe and she has to go to England to stay with her long, lost realitives. When she arrives at Wakefield, the estate of her distant cousin Charles Fielding, she doesn't know how to feel. She's attracted to Jason Fielding, the bastard son of Charles, but she is determined to keep herself from loving him for she knows that no one can melt his icy heart...and she also believes that if she lets herself love him, she will be as miserable as her father was...little does she know dark secrets surround her, threatening her happiness...This book was beautifully written with vivid realistic characters who easily steal your heart. The reason I rated this four stars is because I felt like there wasn't as much description about the way Jason was feeling. When I read a romance novel, I love to read each characters thoughts and emotions. Jason spent most of the book hiding behind a cynical icy mask. Perhaps the author did this to show how much Jason hid his emotions from the people around him. I also felt like the death of his son Jamie is almost completely ignored after it happens. (His son dies in the first few pages.)The description of Jason's past is horrifying, but the reader has to remember that the reason why the Indians were referred to as \\"dirty\\" and \\"filthy\\" was because that was the way Europeans thought of them. I do not believe this description in any way reflects the views of Judith McNaught.This book made my heart ache for both characters, which is a rare occurance for me. I was convinced they would never break down the barriers that lay between them. So much pain lies in both characters, making them believeable and endearing. This was my first McNaught and definitely not my last, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Once and Always by Judith Mcnaught was a delightful read! Although, honestly I did enjoy Almost Heaven and Something Wonderful much, much more, O&amp;A was still a tear jerker.Victoria grew up in a loving enviornment, whereas Jason grew up with a cruel childhood. Many people are afraid of Jason because of his overbearing presence and power. When Victoria's parents die suddenly, she is sent to live with her long distance cousin, who she's never met, and so happens to be Jason, the powerful lord of Wakefield. Jason is terribly annoyed with Victoria's arrival, and tries his best to find a suitable husband for her. However, suprises always pop up, and Jason finds himself slowly falling for Victoria's innocent charms and gestures. BUT Victoria is already engaged to her childhood sweetheart, Andrew, who on his mother's demands was to leave for Switzerland to visit his cousin and 'test' out his long-term relationship with Victoria to see if they can still remain faithful to each other. Andrew's mother dislikes Victoria immensely and sets out to do some deceiving. She tells Victoria that Andrew is already engaged to his cousin, and that she should go on with her life and forget about the past. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Victoria seeks comfort from Jason, and they eventually get married. Many events occur as the two lovers try to sort out their true feelings. When the truth is revealed about all the lies and deceit, chaos arises and Victoria's love for Jason is sorely tested.One part I didn't like about the novel, is that poor Andrew, who was innocent in all his mother's lies, had to give up his true chance for happiness with Victoria, for it was already too late. It was sad, but that's my opinion, and besides that, the book was wonderful."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was the book that got me hooked on Judith McNaught. I have read as many of her books that I can get my hands on, but this still remains one of my favourites. Victoria and Jason are both souls who have been hurt and need to be healed by each other. The initial scenes between Victoria and Jason were enough to make me laugh out loud and I liked the secondary characters. A wonderful love story that makes you believe in the healing power of love."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was the first book of Mcnaught's that I have read and to tell you the truth it'll not be the last. I positively fell in love with the characters. I thought that the appearance of Bainbridge was a unique twist to the turn of events. I felt sorry for Jason when I found out about his past and my heart went out to him. I can't wait to get a copy of Once and Always since the one I have is a library edition. This book is a must read to all romance readers."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This book is abosolutely wonderful. It is filled passion, pain and love.

You fall in love with Jason Feilding at first description and throughout the book are torn between cheering for him and Victoria or keeping him for yourself. The heroin is smart and independent, standing up for herself and feircly protecting everything she holds dear. Yes, this is a definite read for anyone who loves to watch two people fight their love the entire way, but in the end give in the their deepest desires"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I know this book has already received so man reviews, but I had to write about it. I loved this book. I've read a lot of romance novels and I sincerely think this is one of the best. I love the fact that Jason and victoria fell in love slowly and not right away like some other novels and when they did, they did it deeply. you could watch their love unravel. Victoria wasn't some soft heroine that chased after a man and he didn't chase after her. it was all mutual when it happened and the whole story was very believable. The story is not strange like many make it seem, it was just more real than some of the other novels out there. There's a lot of dialogue between them so you can see what turned them on to each other. this is a must read.The only thing I hated about it is that the author never said when he left his mistress and it didn't have an epilogue. I would've loved to see what happened to them years after the story was done."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have read hundreds of romance novels but this is my absolute favorite. You really get involved with these characters. You hope with them, cry with them and cheer as they finally get their acts together.A definite must read!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"What can I say? Judith McNaught has a great formula! I've reread this book over and over again alongside Whitney, My Love, Double Standards, and Almost Heaven, although I would say that I like the others better. The plot itself is nothing spectacular but the story moves along well. It's the characters that shine. Jason's quite the man, Victoria is lovely, clever, and a true heroine, and the supporting cast is properly loving of the main characters and also humourous. Their love is a greatly tortured one.

I havn't read the other books she has wrote, but I do intend to. This book made me laugh and cry unlike movies I have seen, Judith is a great writer and she puts all emotions in her book. I have read alot of historical and this is my favorite. I loved to watch victoria actually bloom she started out as a young woman and ended up a full woman by the end of the story, To actually see how much Jason really loved her was the best part of all. I think I would like to know what happens to Andrew, it was sad he lost everything."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Once and Always is one of my all time fav's. I love this book.

I could not put this book down and finished it in 1 day."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I love all Judith McNaught books!!!! I have them all, Whitney my Love, Once and Always, Paradise, etc. I love her books, I can honestly that no other author compares to her, some are close, but not quite. Once and Always is great. And although it may sound corny all woman have the desire to have a romance like this. Sure Jason was a jerk at times, but he's the kind of man we want to sweep us off our feet and that goes for any woman. Excellent novel, but that no surprise to any whose read McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I first read Once and Always several years ago. I have reread it many times. It is one of my very favorites because it is pure escapism. The two main characters, Jason and Victoria, are irresistable, and the story comes alive for the reader through Judith's words. If you like this book, may I also suggest Almost Heaven, and Something Wonderful. All of these are earlier works, and in my opinion, much, much better than her more recent books. There is something special about all of them, and they will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"After reading 'Double Standard', I found to my surprise that Judith McNaught could write historical romance so well. I thoroughly enjoyed it.The characters are realistic. They don't fall in love rightaway. As the story unfolds, you are drawn more and more into the emotions of the characters. This is my second McNaught book and I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"One of the best examples of Judith McNaught's writing. The plot has the required twists, before the final expected ending. Jason's plight makes one feel sick to the stomach realizing that Ms. McNaught is merely recounting things that were everyday life occurance in Regancy England. The final scene is overwhelming."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Every one of McNaught's books I read are fanatastic, they just keep getting better and better, and this book was no diffrent. I could not put the book down, because it captivated me. The characters of Jason and Victoria were absolutely great, they were very interesting, the storyline was fast paced and kept you wanting to read more. So once again Judith McNaught makes me one of her most avid readers. Keep on writing, when is the next book."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is one of those books that I'll always remember. The characters were interesting and lovable. I'll read it again!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Much like its title, Once and Always, had captured my heart the first time I opened its covers and kept it ever since (ok, so it's not exactly like the title...)This book, have always been to me, one of JM's most treasurable masterpieces. Only she can create characters that can make some of the stupidest mistakes yet still redeem themselves and become perfect again by the end of the book.Victoria's gentle courage and beautiful nature is something that I, as a female, have always strived to be. And despite Jason's flaws and mistakes, he is still one of those men (a JM man) who melts your heart and makes you love him all the same.I know that some other reviewers have some major complaints about the main characters. And despite Jason and Victoria has dug themselves into my heart and earned a place there for all time, I am not blind to their faults. I do not deny that Jason and Victoria may have some flaws but these flaws did not ruin my image of them, but only seemed to endear them further in my eyes. No one's perfect and I doubt there are not many people who wants to read about perfect heroes and heroines who never make any mistakes. But JM's characters come as close as they could to perfection without making them seem unrealistic and unbelievable. Jason and Victoria are two of JM's most splendid and unbelievable creations (and if you read JM, you will know that's not just any compliment) who will stay with you forever.The only, ONLY complaint I ever had of O&A; is that it ended too soon. It is my only favorite JM book without the famous JM trademark ending. And I pray for the day that she would extend the ending to O&A; like she did Whitney, My Love.Once and Always is a story of two people who finds love when they least expected or wanted it. It is a fairy tale that tells of a courageous, young woman who brings light and laughter to the home and heart of a man who had long forgotten the meaning of love.Once and Always is a story that will melt even the coldest heart and make even the most skeptical cynic believe in the magic of love and the beautiful world of Judith McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I thought the book was great, like all the Judith McNaught novels I have read so far.The very first chapter hooked me up, althogh after that, and up until about the middle of the book, I had a bit of a difficult time accepting Jason, and that is the only complain I have about this book. I think it took too long for a love story to develop between the main characters. I had already read half the book, and still there were no tender feelings between Jason and Victoria.And I must admit that the scene of the &quot;wedding night&quot; made me feel very angry at Jason, as well as his stupidity the next morning, when instead of understanding Victoria's reaction, and trying to reassure her and console her and beg her forgiveness for his savage behavior, he went into a rage and tumbled down her door, making her feel even more miserable and scared than she already was.But after that I started to like him and understand him more and more, until the final scene that melted my heart and brought tears to my eyes.I consider this book a heart wrenching novel about pain, loss, childhood trauma and passion but above averything else, love and its healing powers.Read it and you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was my first Judith McNaught novel and won't be my last! Great characters! Both hero and heroine have great depth. I love historical ficton. Once and Always was a delight!A book you will not be able to put down so have those dishes done before you start."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Jason Fielding is domineering and, in some instances, rather scary in his bursts of temper. He treats Victoria as though she is nothing more than a &quot;lady of the night.&quot; I do not agree, though, that Victoria allows him to get away with it. Victoria is a very strong character and, although frightened of Jason, will tell it like it is to him. Towards the end of the book, the reader is finally able to glimpse the softer side of Jason, but it is a long time in coming. The ending is adorable, but I do wish that Jason wasn't so vile and contemptible up until that point."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"My mother and I both read Judith McNaught's books, and we love all of them! Once And Always, set in England, is one of her better ones. We start with Jason, the rich man whose heart has been broken by the death of his son and the scorn of his dead wife, who had run away to be with her lover, taking their son with her. Then, Jason's new wife Victoria enters the picture. Scared and confused, she runs from his touch but earns his desire, unintentionally, and then intentionally, making him want her. With good character plotting, scenes that made me cry, and some good humor, Once and Always is a book I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was my first McNaught book, and I was totally blown away. The only book I like better is Paradise, but this book was just amazing. Jason was everything a woman can ever want, and Victoria is everything we women could ever wish to be. Their experiences left me feeling the extremes of emotions; first laughing, then crying. The part where Jason finds out that Victoria had befriended the ferocious &quot;dog&quot; was great! It shows how much he cared for her. At the end of the book, my heartstrings where just pulled; but I won't tell you. You have to read it to find out! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Ever since I can remember my mother has been reading romance novels. She's a real big Judith McNaught fan and she insisted that I read some of her novels. I enjoyed all of them but ONCE AND ALWAYS was my favorite. It's not everyday that you read such a love story and actually fall for the hero in the book. Why can't all guys be as wonderful as Jason is? If you're into romance novels, ONCE AND ALWAYS is a must and if you aren't, after reading this beautifully mastered love story, you will be a fan. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith McNaught has a flair for creating great heroes, and Jason is no exception. Victoria is no slouch either. Add a well-written storyline and you've got another fun read.Jason is one of those tortured heroes. He has a deep dark past that causes him to distrust women. Victoria is a spitfire, but also is generous and understanding. When these two fight, you won't be able to put the book down you'll be so enthralled. When they fall in love, you'll fall in love. When they fall on hard times you'll feel for them.The only thing I didn't like about this book was the plot device of using Jason's friend to be Victoria's guide to Jason's past, and heading the star-crossed lovers in the right direction. I think it would have been more emotional and interesting to read to have the two lovers discover together the hurt in their past.The ending of this book is not to be missed, though (and I won't give any of it away to ruin the fun). If nothing else, buy the book and read it for the ending. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"blatant racism and abuse does not equal a romance novel.please read books by other authors if you need to know how a romance hero is supposed to treat women.it boggles my mind that so many women like the fact that the only decent character in the book, andrew, gets tossed aside for f'ed-up jason.edit- i just read mcnaught's kingdom of dreams. that book is really good. can't believe they're both by the same author. read that instead."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"After reading many of JM other books, what I loved about this one that was different from the rest is there was not a big \\"misunderstanding\\" between the characters that has happened in so many of her other books.

I was in agony reading about Jason's past and I longed for him to have a happy ending. I though Victoria was a wonderful spirited girl, but one who wasn't so perfect that she was annoying.I hold this book as the measure against which all other romance novels are judged. The same is true for Judith McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is a great romance novel that will warm your heart and make you believe in the power of love when you finish the book. Yes, it's corny, but Judith McNaught's books do that to you, especially this one. The love that Jason and Victoria share are realistic and the obstacles they overcome are also very realistic, which just strenghthens their bond. The process that they go through to solidify their love is described with such heartwrenching detail and complexity. In short, you end up believing in their love for each other, in their future. From the moment Jason and Victoria enter the pages of this book, in their separate worlds, they're such interesting individuals you immediately want to know more about them and can't wait for them to meet and clash their wills with each other (because it's obviously inevitable when you consider their different personalities) and eventually realize they're perfect for each other and fall in love.Jason is a gorgeous hero, cold and hard on the outside but he's really hiding a warm human being on the inside because of his cruel upbringing. Victoria is also as perfect a heroine as I can conjure up myself, she's so strong and determined yet always managing to be sweet and tender. She, and only she, is capable of healing Jason. My favorite parts of the book would have to be that after they're married and he's cold to her because she is too naive to understand what he really wants (what all men want, really) and then, after she gets valuable advice, tries to 'seduce' him. JM always manages to make her scenes so funny and yet so poignant at the same time. Then, AfTERWARDS, when they are married in every sense of the word, Jason still doesn't accept Victoria fully and she tries to make him jealous and pay attention to her. I thought the ways that she tried to do so were soo cute and funny and smart, and the way Jason reacts just makes my heart wrench. They're just too perfect for each other!! I love it when Jason is trying so hard to be impassive and unemotional but his efforts all come to nothing as sweet natured Victoria always manages to bring his emotions to a boiling point and stirs up the cold world he's created for himself. When he's passionate, when he's tender, when he's jealous, when he's angry, all these emotions come out in their purest, truest form because of Victoria. The reasons they love each other, SHOULD love each other, become clear as the book unfolds...it's such a delightful read.There are, of course, faults with all books, and in this one I can only find two small one. The first is the role that Uncle Charles play, I find that he's too weak a supporting character and hard to believe he would take it so complacently when Jason rides roughshod over him. The second is the way the novel ends. I WANT MORE!!! The way it ends is so abrupt and I don't fully understand Victoria's reactions, first when Andrew comes back and confronts her, and then after she finds out everyone thought she was dead. So many questions are not fully resolved. Is she still in love with Andrew? Does she regret marrying Jason? Is she still mad with Jason? The ending doesn't really spell all of that out, though of course you know she loves Jason wholedheartedly. But what happened to Andrew and how does Jason deal with this whole Andrew thing? I think we the readers should have more answers than the final scenes provides us.But overall this book is one of the sweetest, most romantic and compelling novels I've ever read. It should deserve five stars just because one scene actually brought tears to my eyes, and that rarely happens when I read books, especially romance novels."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This story was so boring. It's the same old stuff, man has a tormented past and can't treat anyone humanly... I was looking for romance, not a disgusting rape scene. Also it totally bothered me that Ms. McNaught would call another race as \\"dirty Indians\\" or that \\"Indians are barbarians who don't object to that kind of cruelty\\". Really you know first hand. What a bigot!! I'll be sticking to classier writers like Susan Elizabeth Phillips or Nan Ryan!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith McNaught has once again wowed me with another one of her wonderful efforts. Once and Always is a roller coaster ride of twists, turns and emotions that kept me riveted from beginning to end. This novel has what I have now gathered to be McNaught's signature protagonists -- a fierce and overly optimistic heroine and a hero you want to kiss and then strangle, or strangle and then kiss, as it is the case with this novel. Victoria Seaton travels from New York to England after her parents die in an accident. She and her sister will be taken care of by distant relatives. Her great-grandmother does not want to look after Victoria because she resembles her traitor granddaughter, so she accepts to care for Dorothy only. Charles, a distant cousin, becomes Victoria's guardian and no sooner does he take her under his wing than he announces her engagement with his nephew, Lord Jason Fielding, in the London Times, without their knowledge. Jason is a heartless, cynical man who has never allowed anyone to get too close. And as he sneers and hisses at Victoria, his uncle, who is actually his father, for Jason is Charles's bastard son, stops at nothing to bring these two together, for he believes that Victoria is the one for Jason. There are many twists throughout the novel.I'd like to warn the reader that the stuff I mention in this review are not spoilers per se. You'll have to read the book to truly grasp everything. I won't mention anything other reviewers haven't mentioned already. I should also warn you that the characters will frustrate you to no end, especially Jason. He is a piece of work! I hate how mean he is to Victoria almost throughout the whole novel. For a while I thought he was truly heartless in spite of knowing part of his horrible past. But I gained a great deal of sympathy for him after I read about his sordid and gruesome childhood. He is more than just a cliche romantic misogynist and the proverbial Duke of Slut that are made popular in dozens of Regency romance novels on bookstore shelves. Jason is a complex anti-hero with a great deal of depth and you see fleeting moments of kindness and vulnerability throughout the novel. Like other reviewers, the fact that he continues to visit his mistress after he meets Victoria and agrees to continue his engagement to her is upsetting. But in Jason's defense, he is Victoria's fianc&eacute; in name only, for she too is as indifferent to the forced arrangement as he is. In other words, I don't think it could be considered infidelity on his part when there is nothing going on between them. Also, those scenes with his mistress are important, for they show how empty, meaningless and superficial his relationships had been before he surrenders to Victoria. I liked the symbolism of the stray dog/wolf that Victoria finds and how this foreshadows the things Victoria has to do to win Jason's heart. Victoria is a strong heroine and I enjoyed her optimism and determination with Jason even when he made things difficult for her. She is a little too good, patient and perfect at times though. It would have been nice if she had a flaw or two, like the heroine in A Kingdom of Dreams. I guess her one flaw is that she is very naive. I also hated all of the misunderstandings between them that lead to that horrible first sexual encounter. If Jason had a scrap of common sense, he had realized that she was nervous about her first time. Anyway, as for the historical setting, this is a Regency romance, which means you get the usual mindless, useless rules and gossips of the haute ton, but here things are done in a more entertaining, more developed manner. As for the other characters, I loved Charles, Captain Farrell and the servants. All of those characters give the story some comic relief with their clever schemes to make Victoria and Jason come together. Even though he appears in the novel in only two scenes, I also liked Andrew. The last scene with him is heartbreaking.All in all, I love this novel. I have read Something Wonderful and A Kingdom of Dreams and I don't know which one of the three I've enjoyed the most. Once and Always is similar to Something Wonderful, except that this one has a darker storyline. Yes, this has the clich&eacute; plot about a seemingly heartless, impassive, alpha male-ish anti-hero who in fact has noble feelings buried deep in his wounded soul and the special woman who opens up his heart once and for all. But the story is written in such a beautiful way that it feels as though you're reading this kind of story for the first time. It is very well written, with flawless characterization and fluid story development. I disagree with the reviewer who says that Jason's change of heart is abrupt. We know the reasons to his apparent callousness when we realize that he is self-conscious and insecure about his past, and that is why he feels incapable of loving someone and unworthy of being loved. I think the one-star reviewers had a hard time enjoying this novel because it isn't the typical sugarcoated romance, but one with intricate, at times selfish and not entirely likeable characters (like Jason and Charles) in which you have to dig deeper than the surface to fully understand and sympathize with them. When I read a novel, regardless of the genre, I want it to be emotionally driven, to make me feel things. I don't like reading books with a storyline as lightweight as tissue paper unless that is what I'm in the mood for. This novel is a treasure. I don't think I have written a review this long in quite a while. When I write long reviews, it is usually to point out the bad things in a novel, not the opposite. The fact that I've written a large review about a novel I love speaks volumes. The one major flaw I find is that there is no epilogue. Anyway, I am hooked on Judith McNaught and I shall give her other historical romances a whirl. I have Whitney, My Love already lined up."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was one of the first historical romance novels that I've read & it is also my favorite!!! I've read it over and over again. I love the characters and Judith McNaught is great. Whitney, My Love, Something Wonderful, Until You & Something Wonderful are also great reads. And if you like this...you will LOVE Johanna Lindsey Malory family novels."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I liked this book but there were so many things that had me starching my head. I did not understand why Victoria would fall in love with Jason. He was a total ASS! He is cruel and basically treats her like crap with insulting comments. Now I kind of liked Jason. Once you got to know is story it explained his character. It did not explain why someone would fall in love with him. Victoria is weak; there are no other words to describe her. She comes from America and she is suppose to be fiery. instead she is pushed around by Jason and her \\"Uncle\\" Charles.Another problem I had with this book is the sex. I'm all for couples having their problems (inexperience or whatever) so that they can work on it. But I don't want to read about a woman almost being raped.Also I think that there were to many misunderstandings in this book and we did not get enough romance."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I read Once and Always years ago and despite all the other romance and fiction novels since then, Jason is one hero I've never been able to forget.His story is more heartbreaking and soul-touching than anything I've ever read --- and I've read a lot. In most stories, one character often overshadows the other so that you walk away feeling like you favor the stronger and tolerate the weaker character. With this book, both Jason and Victoria held their own.I won't recap the story because everyone can read the blurb on the back of the book. I am, however, disappointed with some of the reviews of Once and Always who accuse the author of racism or the hero of being a mean brute. Simply, it was a different world then with different perceptions. So if you wanted a heart-on-his-sleeve hero and politically correct sentences, look under the contemporary romance section.Okay, maybe I'll recap a little. Victoria becomes orphaned, travels from America to England to be taken in by her distant elderly cousin and his son, Jason. Victoria thinks this to be a temporary solution since she is convinced her childhood sweatheart, Andrew, will come and collect her as soon as he finds out where she is and, with him, bring her happily ever after. Well, a lot of nefarious meddling ensues and before you know it, Jason and Victoria are married. Some folks are so despondent over the loss of Andrew (the only decent character in the book, some say).Had she married Andrew, her life would have been just like her mother's: routine but lifeless. Her happily ever after was waiting in Jason, not Andrew. At first, I also felt like the final reunion scene was a bit short, but after reading the chapters preceding, there was a lot closure in them that would have made a longer ending redundant. Because in the end, Jason can be a brute, an ass, and even a bastard, but Victoria will forgive him and love him more for it. Who ever said love made sense?"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is my first time reading a novel by Judith McNaught and let me say...I was not disappointed. I finished the book in less then three days :), I couldn't put this book down. Now I have been reading romance stories since I was in middle school...I am 19 now and I am going to have to admitt, that J.M. is a very talented writer and that \\"Once and Always\\" will have to go on top of the list with Kathleen Woodiwiss's \\"A Rose in Winter\\", along with \\"The Prize\\" and \\"My wicked Enchantress\\" & \\"The Ransom\\". I have just ordered two more of her novels, and I know they will be amazing. I would recomend this story to any romance reader who enjoys the \\"troubled\\" man, with a painful past, and the feisty, outspoken female as the main characters. Great book, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Romance Reader (Post: September 15, 2006 ),I agree with you wholeheartedly; I did not like the way this was done. Jason was indeed a difficult man to like due to his treatment of Victoria. It was disheartening that Victoria put up with it. Also, the story took a light attitude about a heinous deception that was instrumental in denying a love match between Andrew and Victoria. I didn't particularly care how others involved themselves in Victoria's personal relationships as if they had the right to determine her destiny. Then the novel ends on a happily ever after note but this wasn't the case, not for everyone. A good man (Andrew) had to leave England and return home to America without the woman he knew and loved most of his life because of the interference and deviousness of others :( The whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"There is no one like Judith McNaught for making you just sigh at the lovely romance she creates. She's the master, truly. Although this isn't my favorite of hers, it's still awesome and better than most of the other romances out there.What I didn't like was that while all of her characters are extreme alpha males (and all basically the same except for some minor detail changes), Jason was quite the jerk. Of course, it's nice to see him go from being a big jerk to totally besotted, but still. Like other reviewers, I was deeply disturbed at the wedding night scene and other abusive scenes. He was always shouting at her and man handling her, even deep into the book. I was practically shouting through the book for him to quit grabbing her arms. This book is also pretty formulaic. If you've read her other books, then you know what I mean. The heroines, heroes, side characters, and even descriptions of characters are extremely similar, but I'm ok with that. Her formula works, and her romances are amazing.This has got to be one of the best endings with Jason thinking she's dead. In all romances, it's clear one can't live without the other, and in this, we finally get to \\"see\\" the hero's reaction. Man, I cried right along with Jason! I just wish there had been an epilogue. They'd just barely gotten together before it was all over.All in all, a touching, beautiful romance. I just have issues with the abuse, obviously."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Although I've read all of McNaught's books, I find this one by far one of her best. If you're like me, and enjoy story lines that contain an intense, passionate relationship with not only a strong male character but also a strong female character, then you'll fall inlove with this book the way I did. It's one of her earlier books, and in my opinion one of her most romantic, due to the fact that she focuses in on the relationship more then outside factors like other romance writers tend to do. No, you won't find a murder mystery here, but instead a lovely, intense, sweeping romance. I know, because every time I flip through those pages, I get a tight knot in my stomach and I choke up; thats the sign of a true romance writer. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Once and Always is one of McNaught's best works. I love this book. I read this book so many times and I still can't believe the love between the two characters, Victoria and Jason. Both characters were very 3-dimensional, strong individuals. I laughed and cried. I think that out of all McNaught's books, this book outshines all the rest because she concentrated on the development of the relationship between Victoria and Jason. I recommend this book to everyone. I promise you that you won't regret reading this book. The Best!!!! I also recommend A Kingdom of Dreams, Almost Heaven, Something Wonderful, Whitney, My Love, and Paradise. Ok, I am a McNaught fan. She's a great writer. I also recommend Devereaux's Heiress and some of Garwood's works."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I've read every Judith McNaught book there is and Once and Always is my all-time favorite. I don't know what it is about this story, but it really touches me everytime I read it. I like the fact that Jason was not as controlling as some of the other leading men in her novels (I couldn't stand Clayton in Whitney, My Love, for example), although he was a very strong and commanding character. I thought Victoria was a strong heroine and had a lot of self-respect. Their story was so moving, but it was extremely funny at times too. Although I enjoyed her books Something Wonderful and Perfect, I felt that they lacked something that this book had. All in all, this book has everything you could possible want in a JM novel. I also recommend Almost Heaven and Paradise."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"As usual, Judith McNaught is worthy of 5 stars writing yet another awesome book! I read this in one day, truly not able to put it down once. The house could have fallen down around me and still I would have sat there with a silly grin on my face, reading away.Victoria is thrust as a suddenly orphaned beauty into the home of a distant relative with a very frightening repuation. Though afraid and homesick, she sees through his rockhard exterior to the saddened and lonely man inside and offers him a love like no other. And oh my God... no one can tell a story like JM!!These characters came alive before my eyes from page one. Victoria was amazing. In the midst of all the snobby London ladies, she appeared so sweet and refreshing and I just wanted to shout at Jason to open his eyes and trust her! And Jason was so afraid to love again... so hurt from his horrid past yet very protective of this young girl who could make him laugh, ingnite desire deep within him and even cause him to engage in a duel causing him to be shot by a tree (he he... very funny).The plot was amazing and the characters deep, complex people you could care about. Jason had thought Victoria to be a gentle, courageous, spirited angel... and he was oh so right. She was the perfect heroine and the perfect match for a man such as Jason... and though he was difficult and arrogant throughout much of the book it was plain to see the hurt and need for love inside him. Not to mention the fact that he was just plain *yummy*. Strong yet gentle leading men are definetely the best.If you haven't read this book, I recommend it highly. And then do yourself a favour and read the rest of Judith McNaught's books, starting with A Kingdom of Dreams (breathtaking). I bought her entire collection and they are reserved a permanent spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I loved \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\" and \\"Whitney, My Love,\\" so I dove into this book expecting great things, especially since it came so highly recommended by McNaught fans. I have to say, I was sorely disappointed. To be sure, the writing was good and it contained McNaught's flair for story telling. But the characters really let me down.I found the hero, Jason Fielding, to be far too much of a jerk for me to ever understand why the heroine would love such a man. I understand he had a tortured past, and that did much to explain his general attitude. But throughout the story he was consistently cruel and indifferent - downright mean - to Victoria. I never saw him softening or doing anything that indicated he was anything more than a hardened, cynical alpha-male. It wasn't until the very end that he expressed any indication that he cared for her at all. Too, we were not afforded enough glimpses into his thought processes to believe he was falling in love with her. I never felt that he fought against a growing attraction - from what I saw through his actions and treatment of Victoria, he really didn't love her at all until the very end.Too, I didn't like that Jason continued his relationship with his mistress after he'd met Victoria. Perhaps that would have helped me buy into the premise that he loved Victoria - if he would have lost all desire for other women.And since I found Jason hard to like, much less love, I didn't much respect Victoria. She was a little too perfect - a little too understanding and accepting of his cruel treatment of her. Sure, he took her in and bought her clothes, but that didn't give him the right to treat her the way he did. Their wedding night was a true horror, and I had a hard time understanding how Victoria would ever get over her fears enough to sleep with him again. Since Jason never did much to earn her love, I found Victoria's feelings for him baffling.Also, I am getting a bit tired of some of the repeated plot contrivances McNaught uses. The young ingenue who becomes the darling of the British ton. The endless misunderstandings that cause both the hero and heroine to act in loathsome ways towards each other. In this story, especially, I was annoyed by Jason's lack of understanding of Victoria's innocence and his willingness to believe she wasn't a virgin. And in the end, when Victoria learned of her cousin Charles' treachery, she instantly condemned Jason despite Charles telling her that Jason had no hand in it.My final complaint was the ending. All of the sudden, after one tiny argument in the scheme of their relationship, Jason does a 180 degree turn and is confessing his love for her. He'd shown her no affection for the first 7/8ths of the book but suddenly became a doting husband. I felt like McNaught was nearing her word count and realized she was running out of pages and needed to wrap things up as quickly as possible.I did like Jason's reaction when he believed Victoria to be dead - it was the only time in the story when I got a glimpse as to the depth of his feelings for her. And I did like that Victoria didn't require pages of convincing to believe that he had no hand in the misunderstanding with Andrew.All in all, this one was not my favorite McNaught. I'll stick with \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\"."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith Mcnaught's novel Once &amp; Always has sent me on a quest to find all of her novels!!!! I fell in love and am still in love with Jason Fielding!!! If you have not read the book, then you have certainly missed out on sheer pleasure!!!I only wish I had read her books earlier in my life!!! I am on a quest to find all of her books especially since she reintroduces many of her characters throughout her novels.Mcnaught is an exceptional writer;she shares her talent in a way that enables you to dream again!!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"put in one part young, innocent, and beautiful heroine, one part emotionally tortured hero, and one part sensual love scenes and it's the making of one of the more moving romantic novels you'll ever read.judith mcnaught is quickly becoming my favorite romantic novelist and here's why: she is one of the best authors when it comes to character development, her heroes are alpha male (which is my favorite kind of hero, frankly), and there is always deep emotional depiction within her books. NONE of her heroes fall lightly. they might start off as cold and emotionally distant but that guarantees that when the hero falls, he's gonna fall so hard that he can't ever get up.and so it goes with \\"once and always\\". victoria seaton is the innocent beauty sent to england from america after her parents are killed. she is to stay with her \\"uncle\\" charles. turns out, charles has a plan. he has announced her betrothal to his nephew, Jason Fielding before she has even gotten there.Jason Fielding, Marquess of Wakefield, is about as emotionally distant as a hero can get. By this time he has already lost a wife and son when the ship she stole the son away to as she was running away with her lover, crashes at sea. can you see why he isn't willing to love anyone? need more reason? he had the kind of emotionally tormented childhood that will make you cry when you read about it. he's not just mean because he's a man and is supposed to be mean. he's mean because he thinks himself unworthy of love and incapable of giving it. it is for this reason why the story of this romance was so compelling and moving. jason is one of the most emotionally vulnerable alpha hero i've read about. while much of what he did initially to victoria wasn't all that nice, mcnaught writes of him in such a way that the reader can see his vulnerability right through his actions.victoria is a wonderful heroine. she is kind and spirited and is definitely not a door mat. she doesn't just let jason take advantage of her, which is always important when the hero is so dominating. of course she's beautiful, but that's just one of her many attributes.he goes on with his emotional distance through most of the book, but there are cracks in his emotional facade, albeit small ones. however, one of the highlights of the book is actually the SECOND time victoria and jason are sexually intimate. BIG CRACK. then, for those who have read \\"kingdom of dreams\\" there is a de ja vu moment during another intimate moment between victoria and jason. i won't give it away, but i'll say that it's probably even MORE moving in this story, and that's saying ALOT. his emotional barrier shatters after that, a really satisfying moment for me.by the time we get near the end where jason finally shows he has a heart, i was in tears. what a moving moment.the only downside is that there was no epilogue. i would have loved to see if victoria had a son so that jason could again know the fatherly love he had stripped from him when his son was killed.other than that, this book was damn near perfect. i HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I am not too familiar with McNaught's work, but this novel proves to me that she is not the typical romance writer. She incorperates within her female characters a sense of strength and courage. This particular story wasn't merely romantic but contained some comedy as well. Victoria is fun character, and Jason is well developed in a way unlike most male characters within romances. The reader is given the opportunity to understand with depth the history of Jason in a manner that isn't fleeting or irrelevent. I haven't read many of McNaught's books but this has definitely made me a fan."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was a fantastic book! When I first bought it I put in on my bookshelf to read it later, well, that later turned out to be about 5 months later. I picked it up yesterday because I was bored I needed something to read. This book totally took me by surprise! Once I started reading I HATED to put it down. The characters are IMPOSSIBLE to not love. I'm not going to explain what this book is about because the other reviews do a great job at that, but I am going to say this: I loved the parts of this book are when the servents are gossiping about their lord and lady's relationship (when jason SPECIFICALLY forbid them to do any gossiping what-so-ever) It is hillarious listening to them whisper to one another, then have a maid hear, and tell another maid and then it reaches the grooms and so on. I laughed my head off listening to them! Oh, and might I add that besides the servents, Tory's great-grandmother was great! (and don't you dare call her otherwise!) Now, I know she seems like an old hag at the beginning, but you're going to love her at the end, I promise! Once and Always was beautifully written and I loved ever second I spent on this book. You're crazy to let this one slip through your fingers!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is the first Judith McNaught book I've ever read and I am very impressed. I am not much on Romance books, (I like Greg Isle books) but, I found myself drawn to the description of this book and bought it on impulse. I ended up reading the entire book in one day. I absolutely could not put it down. Like another reviewer said \\"If the house fell down around me I don't think I could have put this book down.\\" It draws you in from the first page and you are hooked.The only small complaint that I have about this book (which is also the reason I don't like most romance books) is that Jason, the leading male character is so hateful and mean then when he suddenly changes his mind and falls for Victoria then the author has him calling her \\"Darling\\" and \\"My sweet\\" when that was not AT ALL in his character. That turns me off romance books, but even though this book followed suit, I will forgive it in this book because it is such a great story otherwise. So, I will still give it 5 stars!! OUTSTANDING!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This book is funny to me! For you who havent read this book i suggest it to you is worth the cover price..."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Ms. McNaught you should write a book about John Marchman, I adore the shy lord. I've read all your regency books and LOVED them. Thanks for showing the world your talent."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"One of the best books I ever read. One should have no reservations about reading this enthralling romance. It was just beautiful. Victoria and Jason are such wonderful characters. This is a romance you will read over and over again. I certainly have."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"JM is at her best writing Regency romance, no other writer can excel. And I think &quot;Once and Always&quot; must come first among her works, sharing the honour jointly with &quot;Something Wonderful&quot;, another excellent novel by JM. The characters are so real and loveable that you just wish the book would never end."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith McNaught knows how to make you cry! This one surely made me cry!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I read almost all of Ms McNaught's books and this one I consider to be the best. I have bought it in late 1992 and I have been re-reading it ever since and whenever I have time for a superb historical romance. Every historical romance reader should have at least one copy !"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I agree with most of the reviews about this book. It is so much darker and I had a hard time letting go of the depressing feelings even after the book ended. The end when he believes her to be dead (I won't ruin it for you) was such a poignant moment that it almost moved this book up to 4 stars instead of 3.I enjoyed the story and the characters but I knew I probably wouldn't read it again so I turned it into the used bookstore (something I haven't done with any other McNaught book). I would still recommend this book over a lot of authors' best works, though."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This title speaks for all of Judith McNaught's works, once you start reading her books, you will always look for more. It was the first book I read by Ms. McNaught and I wasn't disappointed. Even though it wasn't as fast paced as her other novels, it was good too. Victoria has a strong character and is a great heroine. Jason is also great. You can get an update of their lives in UNTIL YOU."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This novel is very touching. LOTS of heart wrenching moments"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I am a H-U-G-E McNaught fan - don't get me wrong. Like her other books I was enjoying the poignancy of a good romance novel until the time I came to read about Jason's past. To evoke sympathy among the readers, will Ms McNaught go any length? That aspect of the story had no basis what so ever. All through the pages, the Indians were portaryed as \\"dirty\\", \\"ragged\\" - now where did this bias come from? Being of Indian origin myself I was absolutely disgusted. There is also the question of religion. Throughout generations and even now the dominant religion in India has been Hinduism. So why were the \\"poverty stricken dirty Indians\\" dragged into the sadistic torture of a white British(who by the way unjustly occupied India during that era and tortured the rightful citizen and looted the country) Christian boy? Answers anyone?I've read all of Mcnaught books and laughed and cried and loved the characters. But I was very very disappointed at the inaccuracy of facts and cruel words hurled at a particular race (who by the way are very educated and cultured) just to tickle sentiments for the hero.I think it is badly done Ms Mcnaught!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was not the first book of McNaught's I read but the third. I was instantly in love with her main characters. No missish weak willed heroine here! I just can't decide if this one or Almost Heaven is my favorite. All of her regency books are great, but I think this one is on the top of the cake! Victoria grew up a strong sensible no nonsense gal. Proud of her upbringing she set anyone on their ear if they speak against her. And Jason the stony hard headed man who at times you want to bash and then you see the protective endearing side of him that makes you fall in love with him. I really love the fact that McNaught doesn't use violence to prove the heroine needs the hero. Her characters are charming full of wit and you can literally feel the personalities as you read her books. No &quot;Me Tarzan, you Jane&quot; reading here. Very, very lively storytelling."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I loved this book. The culmination of love between the hero and heroine is fanatastic. I re-read excerpts after reading it, and regreted having to return my copy to the library. One of my all time favorite love stories."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I've read this book so many times that I've lost count. You'd think by now, I would be bored reading the same lines over and over again...Well, it's not the case! Sure,I know what is going to happen but I still get that sinking feeling whenever I read some sad part, I can't help smiling over Victoria and Jason's definitely stormy exchanges. I Love the characters, I love the plot, I just plain love this book!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I think that Judith McNaught is a wonderful author and I have enjoyed all of her books. While I was at the bookstore yesterday I was disappointed because she did not have any new books out. Judith McNaught is funny and she will keep you on the edge of your seat. &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Whitney My Love&quot; are still my favorites, but I can't wait until the new one comes out! I started reading these novels and was hooked, and now both of my sisters are hooked also."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Truly wonderful. Victoria is gentle serenity personified and Jason is the tortured soul healed by her love.

The book takes ur imagination and transports it to another period of time! It's amazing! There were times when the book was incredibly funny and others when I COULDN'T stop CRYING! I highly recomend it!!!!!!!!! Have fun reding!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This book has strong, dinamic characters who experience a wide range of emotions. You will laugh, yell, and cry right along with Tory and Jason. By the end of the book you will be in love with Jason and will want to be Victoria.

Jason shows no love feelings or emotions until the last minute, which was impossible to believe. Victoria is not as strong as Ms.McNaught's other heroines. she tries too hard to please Jason. the storyline was not as intense as the other ones. the dialogues were not heart pumping speeches. there's no humor or laughter in this story. this is NOT one of Ms.McNaught's good book. i don't recommend to anyone else!!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"To make this short and sweet: I hated Once And Always. The hero was just plain mean and paranoid, the heroine was practically groveling at the hero's feet for affection and there were too many misunderstandings based on the stupidest things. I agreed with one particular reviewer, the only character who was likeable was the heroine's ex-fiance, and he got tossed aside for the cruel, emotionally screwed up hero."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I usually like Judith McNaught and fully expect that the big misunderstanding will occur which has us biting our nails but this one was too much for me. Jason was a jerk! I know once you found out about his story, there was some sympathy there but not enough. I liked Tory even though she was way too understanding of Jason....especially after the wedding night. I also didn't like that he saw his mistress after the wedding even though he 'loved' her then. I just couldn't get past his treatment, even if it was accepted for the time period. I was actually hoping for Andrew to come to England and take her away and I was so sad that she didn't go back with him. In a romance novel I don't like disliking the 'hero' but couldn't help it on this one. I will read her other books but this one was not a keeper in my eyes."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was my first Judith Mcnaught book and let me tell you she did not disappoint. After I picked up this book I did not get anything done at all because I could not put it down, I ended up reading it in almost a day. I really couldn't think of a bad thing to put in this review, except if you have things you need to get done, don't begin to read it. If your looking for an exceptional love story that will stay with you, you've found it....."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have recently become a Judith McNaught fan with the reading of my all-time favorite A Kingdom of Dreams which was fantastic and the other two in the series were pretty good....Whitney, My Love and Until You. I thought Once and Always was ok, but I tired of Jason's continually ill treatment of Victoria and a little confused by his 180 personality turn in the end. I have to keep reminding myself that the treatment of women and arranged marriages with \\"kept\\" women was customary for the time period, but I tend to like my heroes to \\"forget all other women\\" and persue the lady only. Of coarse, this was a nice twist if you're tired of the same old, same old - for Jason was a tortured, bitter sole that unleased on the undeserving Victoria...who took it and took it until finally he saw her worth and truely fell in love with her. To lightly quote the book.....\\"he would love only once, but that love would last always.\\""},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Okay i don't understand why everyone has a problem with Victoria being almost perfect? That fact is,is that she isn't. Sure she was beautiful, (so r alot of people), She could play the piano beautifully...but she had flaws. Just like reality, sum people can do things better than others. but Victoria had problems trusting too much, not paying attention, and she was smart but didn't have common sence. Those are flaws...not accidents the writer makes...Jason...he is the perfect hero. I'll admit i didn't like that he went to his mistress, but sum reviewers thought he was more sympethetic to his mistress than to Tory. Okay he didn't trust Tory, he assumed she only wanted him for his wealth, while he KNEW thats why his mistress wanted him...Jason is a tortured soul...you just have to give him time...its a great book don't miss out b/c of some one else's review. At least borrow it, or get it from the library, take a chance. JM is a fantastic writer..."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I picked this book up and from start to finish could not put it down! I just loved Jason and Victoria. I felt so bad for Jason, you could almost feel his pain and Vicotria was the kind of strong heroine that I love to read about in a book! She was strong and loving and knew that this scrumptious hunk of a man was gonna love her and didnt stop until she made it happen!! If all of Judith Mcnaught's books are like this one, I will be going and buying every last one of them!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Wow!!! This was the first Judith McNaught book that I read and I was a little weary of buying it but boy am I glad that I did. It is wonderful!!! Victoria is funny and courageous. Jason is a little hard but from the very begginning you sympathize with him and just want to give him a lot of love. These characters were perfect for each other. The book is so good that I went out and bought another 5 of McNaught's books and they didn't disappoint!!!!! If anything they got better!!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Much like its title, Once and Always, had captured my heart the first time I its covers and kept it ever since (ok, so it's not exactly like the title...)This book, have always been to me, one of JM's most treasurable masterpieces. Only she can create characters that can make some of the stupidest mistakes yet still redeem themselves and become perfect again by the end of the book.Victoria's gentle courage and beautiful nature is something that I, as a female, have always strived to be. And despite Jason's flaws and mistakes, he is still one of those men (a JM man) who melts your heart and makes you love him all the same.I know that some other reviewers have some major complaints about the main characters. And despite Jason and Victoria has dug themselves into my heart and earned a place there for all time, I am not blind to their faults. I do not deny that Jason and Victoria may have some flaws but these flaws did not ruin my image of them, but only seemed to endear them further in my eyes. No one's perfect and I doubt there are not many people who wants to read about perfect heroes and heroines who never make any mistakes. But JM's characters come as close as they could to perfection without making them seem unrealistic and unbelievable. Jason and Victoria are two of JM's most splendid and unbelievable creations (and if you read JM, you will know that's not just any compliment) who will stay with you forever.The only, ONLY complaint I ever had of O&amp;A is that it ended too soon. It is my only favorite JM book without the famous JM trademark ending. And I pray for the day that she would extend the ending to O&amp;A like she did Whitney, My Love.Once and Always is a story of two people who finds love when they least expected or wanted it. It is a fairy tale that tells of a courageous, young woman who brings light and laughter to the home and heart of a man who had long forgotten the meaning of love.Once and Always is a story that will melt even the coldest heart and make even the most skeptical cynic believe in the magic of love and the beautiful world of Judith McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Everyone seems to think that this book is the best of all... However, i think, as compared to Whitney, my love , Until you, Almost Heaven... Once and Always seems to lose out. I admit that it is awfully romantic and enjoyable..however, Victoria seems to be the only one making all the efforts. True, Jason had a sad past.. But the terrible ways he treat Victoria was really upsetting. ( wedding night, and the night at London after the Ball, ...) and Jason's thoughts were not reveal to us, readers much... I thought the ending could be have been better, showing more of what happened after that.. their happy marriage.. Still, it was satisfying enough and enjoyable too."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Jason and Victoria are such deep characters. And I definately LOVE this book. It's the very first book I've ever read by Judith McNaugth and by the first chapter, I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Another master piece by Judith McNaught. This is the story of Victoria Seaton, an American Girl that goes in search of her remaining family after she is left orphaned. In England, she encounters her cousin, Lord Jason Fielding, a man who knows his appeal, but is weary of attention. Victoria and Jason marry, and they their love grows from the understanding and care they give each other.

However, I must say how nice it is to have romance novels that do not have pictures on the front that make them embarrassing to read in public (you all know what I mean -- a partially clad, very brawny man literally tearing the clothes off an equally scantily clad nubile young female!! -- Enough, I like my love scenes in textual form, not technocolor on the cover!!)"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have read four of Judith McNaught's books, including this one. It is hard for me to decide which one I liked best, because they were all very interesting and quite different stories. I have enjoyed Ms. McNaught's characters and their emotional struggles. One gets a sense of the characters' internal and external struggles as they are so vividly explained. I can't wait to read other books by the author."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"The heroine is too perfect, except when it comes to common sense. The hero is so tortured that his intelligence is impaired, which makes him jump to wrong conclusions time after time after time. Ms. McNaught jumps from misunderstanding to misunderstanding, which frustrated me because the main characters did not seem to learn from their past mistakes regarding each other. Finally, after spending so much time on melodramatic nonsense, there is not an epilogue that shows how the protagonists managed to overcome their lack of effective communication to understand each other and live happily ever after. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"OK this story has so much to offer but the hero was an absolute jerk and I have NO IDEA why she stayed with the guy. I mean the guy was nasty to her....I also don't like it when a guy in LOVE will go and fool with his mistress. Just doesn't do it for me. If your a McNaught fan I'm sure you'll like it but otherwise I could have done without."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Until You STILL remains my favorite McNaught novel, however this will not disappoint you. Truly an entertaining read. I put it third behind Whitney My Love and Until You, better than Kindgdom of Dreams. The only element I didn't approve of was Jason visiting his mistress after they were married...more disgusting than their wedding night, but I guess essential to the development of the storyline. Overall, it is one of McNaught's better writings and you shouldn't miss out on it."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is a wonderful book...I have read it many time's...I just wish she would write the follow up.. about the sister......I suggest reading it..

To all my friends... you know if I rate something a 4 or 5 Star then it's a must read for you! The only draw back is that I couldn't put it down!

From the first chapter I found that I was captured into the story. So rarely today do we see such a complex structuring of the characters and their story. This is Jason and Victoria's story; there is no murderer to be found, no waif to be saved, no wrong to be righted (inless you count an interfering grandmother) just the indepth growth of a relationship.We all make mistakes in relationships, misjudge people, assume motives, and mistakenly hurt them. It is the relationship that can survive this, that thrives. What a poignant moral for a story. Although the copy of my book was printed in 1987, see if you can pick this story up, its worth the read!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is the vulnerability of the hero. We all want to be the one who tames the tiger and in this book, the heroine does. Jason, deprived and maltreated as a child, overcomes a terrible start in life to become a great businessman and one of the foremost leaders of 19th century London society. Deceived again by a woman who only wants his name and his money, tortured by his own illigitimacy, and in despair after the death of his first born son, Jason builds a wall around his heart that nothing can break down and a reputation in society that Casanova would admire. Into his life comes a girl, Victoria, who, to all intents and purposes he should resent and hate. To his immense surprise and not inconsiderable chagrin he finds she warms his heart and gradually, he begins to love her. The most wonderful scene in the whole wonderful book, takes place in his study when she gives him a present, a small black panther statuette. I defy any woman to resist the vulnerability of this gorgeous needful man. When the two are finally reconciled and his despair at having lost the only woman he ever trusted is assuaged, the denouement is nowhere near long enough for the aching heart and tearful eyes of this reader. Oh where are the Jasons of today?"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have recently become a Judith McNaught fan, but I had a hard time with this one. While I enjoyed the characters and the overall storyline, I found that I had to continually remind myself of the time period and the personal history of each character in order to keep things in perspective and finish the book. I had a hard time with the physical and emotional abuse dished out by the hero of the book. The fact that her husband rapes her on their wedding night and only feels like a monster after he realizes she was a virgin, and then she is the one consumed with how to make things right between them was a pretty big stretch for me, especially considering the fact that the heroine was an intelligent woman with a decent amount of self-respect. Again, I tried to keep the time period of the novel in perspective, as well as the hero's personal pain and history in order to process that as I read. I also had a hard time with the fact that there was more negative relationship drama than positive. There wasn't a strong enough balance for me in terms of all the pain and suffering, versus the short and sweet happy ending. I would have liked more detail and follow-through with the ending than just the last handful of pages of the book. The ending felt incomplete to me."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read a few bad reviews about it now I'm wondering if they read the same book. If you like Judith McNaught books you will love this one. If you never read anything from her, You'll love this one. I couldn't put it down when I was at work it was all that I could think about. Maybe its a mood your in when your reading certain books. I think this one is a keeper and will reread it someday..."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"McNaught draws you in and keeps you turning those pages. This is perfection in plot and characters. I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the world McNaught created. Keep them coming."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have to be honest, I was hesitant to read this book because a lot of reviews said this was a darker romance. Yes, there are some disturbing scenes ( actually, only one if you ask me) and yes, Jason is a jerk, at times, but we musn't forget what he went through and the era which this book talks about. If a modern day romance had a scene like this, I would be appalled and refuse to read further. I think the reason I really liked the book is because of the early interaction between Jason and Victoria, the romance was very sweet and fulfilling! Unlike other books, where the hero and heroine only meet after a 100 or so pages or go in flashback, this book was to the point and focused on them entirely. Victoria is one of the sweetest heroines and perfect for a man like Jason. Like all Mcnaught protagonists, these two will also remain close to my heart forever. Just wish there was an epilogue too. Please do not let the one scene in the book miss you out on such a sweet and fulfilling love story!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Victoria Elizabeth Seaton grew up in a small cottage in America. When she loses her parents in a tragic accident, she and her sister find out that their mother was in fact a Countess and their great-grandmother is the Dowager Duchess of Claremont. However, when the Dowager refused to take Victoria in, she and Dorothy were separated - Dorothy goes to live with the Dowager, while Victoria finds herself at the doorstep of Jason Fielding, the Marquess of Wakefield, whose father, Charles Fielding, was her mother's one true love (and vice versa), and who has the 'romantic notions' of pulling off the wedding of the decade by announcing the engagement of Jason and Victoria without their knowledge or consent.ONCE AND ALWAYS basically has the same elements as SOMETHING WONDERFUL, minus the murder plot. Both introduce the heroine as a child with the same characterizations: nave, sweet, witty and so full of life. Both are your typical ing&eacute;nues, who rise from an unremarkable upbringing to become the darling of the ton. Then we have the typical alpha-males as heroes, disenchanted with life, cold and reserved, and distrustful of women. Both also feature the meddling grandmothers - as cold and sour as they can get. But similar elements aside, this book is fantastic. One cannot help but be captivated with this love story. True, Jason is domineering, sometimes cruel and seemingly unfeeling, but as you learn more about his past, how his ex-wife betrayed him and how tragic his childhood was, you cannot help but sympathize and feel for him. And although Victoria may come across as overly nice, she pretty much puts Jason in his place when he's really crossed the line. But the greatest thing is seeing Jason's defences finally breakdown and accept the love and happiness that Victoria is offering him.Although I do wish that we were given more glimpses of Jason's thoughts and that the ending wasn't rushed (I would at least have liked an epilogue), these minor quibbles do not detract from the utter delight you will feel once you start reading this. I have already read it twice and know that I will read it again."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I thoguht the characters in this story were very WEAK. Especially the heroin Victoria. The only character I thought was the least bit likeable was the one that was treated the worst, barely made an appearance, and got completely shattered in the end. Andrew, Victoria's friend from childhood and a man she thought she would marry before she became an orphan. I thought the deception that her dear &quot;uncle Charles&quot; pulled on her was heinous, and was shocked that the heiroin would forgive him so fast for messing with her life to the extent that he did. She dropped Andrew like a bad habit with out so much as a glance back! Andrew seemed like he was the sweet good guy that could not hurt her. Jason repeatedly hurt her feelings (the scenes with the mistress were repulsive) and she was to weak to stand up to him and too weak to see that &quot;uncle&quot; Charles lied to her to get what he wanted. Not worth reading."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Yes - between all the \\"misunderstandings\\" and date rape behavior - who needs this book. The first kiss was rough & punishing - as was the wedding night.The hero is hard to like at all. I wish she had left with Andrew.I also wish so many romance novels did not promote date rape behavior (e.g., she fights the kiss initially & then caves)."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Victoria and Jason's story is great! I know others have written and said the same but I had to add my two cents worth. You will laugh and cry and believe in the power of love. This is classic McNaught at her best and this is one of my favorites of hers.You won't be disappointed in this story. Especially if you are a romantic at heart."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is your typical regency romance, replete with all the usual suspects:1. Extremely wealthy, tortured (i.e., cruel, combative, cynical, creepy--right up to the last fistful of chapters), deeply misunderstood, excessively gorgeous English lord meets feisty, head-strong, somewhat levelheaded but ultimately naive, but tenderhearted, compassionate, and excessively gorgeous country bumpkin, are thrown at each other against their will.2. The slow dressing down, physically and emotionally, of their past.3. The illogically constant, annoyingly CONSTANT, misunderstandings and assumptions about each other.3. The proverbial wrench in the relationship to frustrate the budding love and the source of more misunderstandings.4. Lastly, let's not the forget the part of any 'love story' or 'romance', in which the male lead rapes the female lead into loving him.Typical romance stuff, yes, but what's always fascinating about the wheel is twisting and bending it to make it seem refreshing. McNaugt, despite her repetition for using the same cast of characters, personal woes and everything else but the kitchen sink, knows how to bend the wheel as she sees fit. So, what's difficult about this book is that it's skillfully written, well paced and there were lovely moments, here and there, but not enough to gloss over the defects. Part of the problem is that there was no substantial secondary plot to cushion the two leads duking it out, i.e., the (underdeveloped and superficially handled) proverbial wrench. Which is fine when the two main leads are the only focus and the everything else merely the backdrop of their budding romance, McNaught just couldn't find a comfortable stride with these two at all. Jason, on his own, is superbly written as the wounded, tormented soul, even if the causes of his pain are rather thin, vague, never really part of why he is the way he is but just lame excuses. Victoria too is not badly written on her own, though woefully deficient compared to Jason. More unsettling, these two together--a completely senseless, disjointed relationship is born.The author attempted to sketch diametrically opposed characters, that is, the idea that complete opposites fatalistically...masochistically...sadistically...attract. This is McNaught's schtik, and one she can pull off effortlessly and excitingly. It doesn't work here. Jason is terrible to her, verbally abusive, offers very little of himself other than a few 'gestures' and is kept too distant for the reader and Victoria, to fully understand. There's something missing in Victoria's characterization that I've yet to figure out. It maybe that she does nothing about his mistreatment of her, and in fact, doesn't do anything at all but just takes it without much of a fight about anything, making Victoria the weak link in this fairy tale.There were several flimsy and artificial scenes that did nothing to progress the plot or the characters or offer deeper insight; while not unpleasant to read, it just weighed the book down further. Towards the second half, it starts to unravel completely, and the author just wants to end the story but not sure how. Worse, the author completely glossed over the rape. Annoyingly, neither EVER communicate their emotions directly to each other, relying completely on others to do it for them, which makes their 'love' rather dissatisfying and unreal to me. It was difficult to get a sense of Jason and Victoria, as people, both as individuals and as a couple, and even less so of their true feelings under all the confusing, mishandled and unnecessary drama McNaugt kept stirring up. Again, there were no instances when either at all acknowledged that his behavior, from beginning to end, was completely unacceptable. The love and romance in this book was convoluted and a foregone conclusion. The romance felt forced and unrealistic. I can handle the leads mistreating each other to create tension and friction, etc, but, BUT, not at the cost of respecting the characters. The author failed in giving us worthy characters to fall in love with, or at least, to a degree, some thing tangible in their romance.McNaught is a talented, intelligent writer and most of her books are wonderful. Here, something important and essential is missing. I suppose if I didn't overthink it, and just read it for what it is, it's a 3 star book but I just couldn't this time. She missed the mark in every respect with Once and Always."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"The Hero of my Regencies have to be believable enough to be my Hero...Jason Felding was every bit my Hero and more.Judith Mcnaught is truly a great story teller. It's impossible to not feel a whole slew of different emotions during the exhilirating ride of pleasure reading one of her books.Besides that, she is accurate for the genre, her books always reeks of well researched topics and gives you an over all education.That is the very existence of a good book for me.Although I like a little drama/suspense with my Regency, and there wasn't enough of it in this book, however, the overall presentation of the novel made up for it.Two thumbs way up.(Please read synopsis on main page)"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"\\"Jason will love only once, and then it will be for always\\", said Mike Farrell to Victoria Seaton Fielding. Mike was a long time friend of Lord Jason Fielding and knew secrets about Jason's past that would explain his behavior towards people, and especially toward Victoria, his wife. He told Victoria that she was probably the one person who could break down the barriers that Jason built up to protect himself from an emotion called love that he didn't believe existed.Jason Fielding was the product of an affair by Charles Fielding, the Duke of Atherton, and a French peasant woman. Charles was young and had no time for a child, so he gave Jason into the care of his sister-in-law, whom he didn't know was an insane zealous religious fanatic, who lived in India and would preach to the heathens about salvation and use Jason as the symbol for the devil by beating and whipping him in front of everyone, and then would make Jason go to the people and beg their forgiveness. Talk about emotional baggage! Jason was eventually taken out of that environment by a kindly sea captain by the name of Mike Farrell who had seen what was done to Jason. Jason eventually reunited with Charles, but because no one had shown Jason any real love during his formative years, he grew up cynical and cold, obsessed with working, making a fortune, and having casual, non-meaningful relationships with women. He doesn't allow anyone to get close to him, and even then he believes that they only want to be with him because of his wealth and title.Along comes Victoria Seaton, an American who arrives at the door of Jason's estate, led to believe that she was invited there to stay after her parents were killed in a carriage accident. Victoria and her sister Dorothy had found out, upon their parents death, that their mother was the daughter of a dowager duchess. The dowager duchess agreed to take Dorothy, but not Victoria, because Victoria was the spitting image of Katherine, her daughter (Victoria's mother) with whom she had a falling out over Katherine's love for Charles Fielding, when they were both young. Katherine eventually married an American physician that she liked and admired, but did not love, and they moved to America. It was Charles' idea for Victoria to live at Jason's estate because he thinks Victoria would be a great marriage prospect for Jason. When Jason finds out that Charles wants him to be married, Jason refuses saying that he will never marry again (he was married earlier to a woman who only wanted his wealth and title, and left Jason for her lover and took their son in an attempt to ransom him back to Jason; they were all killed, though, when their ship sank during a storm).Jason's not sure what to do with Victoria, so he proposes to get her married off to an eligible suitor, but Charles wants Jason to marry Victoria. I won't say any more about the story, but it's a great read, very emotional, and I don't understand how some other readers could be disappointed with it. I think I know what their problem is with it, though. They didn't like that Jason could still be with his mistress even after agreeing to marry Victoria, and how he is always cold and indifferent to Victoria, but tender and passionate in bed. I see that some readers didn't like how Jason could do a 180 degree turn toward the end of the book and suddenly profess his love to Victoria. I'm glad that Judith McNaught didn't have Jason immediately change his ways after he met Victoria. It was going to take time for him to break down the walls of bitterness and ugliness, and it took time for him to trust Victoria completely, to know that she wanted him because of the man he was, in spite of his flaws, and not because of what he represented and could give to her. When she finally saw the physical scars on his back that matched the emotional scars on his heart, and he saw that it didn't matter to her, this is when the floodgates opened for him and he knew then that he could love and be loved unconditionally."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I'd give this book 3.5 stars if I had the option. It was a great read, don't skip it if you're a McNaught fan, but it didn't measure up to my favorites by this author.The storyline was interesting and fullfilling as well as the characters. I disagree with those reviewers who said Jason was cold. It was SO obvious Jason was in love with Victoria. I saw his love for her emerge before her love for him.What I didn't like was all the misunderstandings that lead to such heartache and sadness. The good times when Jason and Victoria were getting along were fun to read. I wish McNaught spent more of her time writing situations like that rather than the ones that had me biting my nails with frustration. I also felt McNaught could have spent more time clearing up the misunderstandings between the two characters in the end.Overall, this was definitely one of the better historicals I've read. You really can't go wrong with McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Semi-SpoilersOkay, let me be the first to say that romance novels are not portraying reality. They are an escape from reality and the scenes, such as the violent ones, need to be placed in their appropriate context. That being said, the hero's behavior in thisbook made me sick for reasons I cannot quite articulate. Mabye it was the fact that he not only raped her, but gave her a gift afterward, as if that evened everything out. Or perhaps it was the way he seemed to so genuinely terrify the heroine, I had difficulty understanding why she would feel safe being around him.A lot of Judith McNaught's heros have genuine rage and anger management issues. Okay, accepted. But they generally reveal a charming and caring side as well. One that is understanding and can be even kind at times. Jason's character was simply dark and frightening, with none of the lighter qualities to endear you to him. And yes, when Andrew, the ex-fiance comes to take her at the end, I was screaming for her to run, not walk, to the nearest exit with him and from Jason's life. But, instead, she's fallen in love with the beast. And I'm left fealing forlorn and afraid for her fate.Okay, and the racism. Let's discuss the RACISM in this Judith McNaught novel. I am demanding a reprint. This was freakin' ridiculous.\\"From the looks of it, she'd just finished beating him in front of her congregation-the Indians don't object to that barbaric cruelty.\\" Nice. So, one fifth of the world's population are pro-cruelty, you say? That line stunned and betrayed me.\\"The Indians are a fanatic lot and I take no interest in their ways. But to see a child of my own race so abused did something to me.\\" Enough said. She needs to retract what she wrote. And maybe look within herself as to why she would have written such lines. Unacceptable."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"In terms of writing ability and talent, Judith McNaught will always be a 5 star for me. Her gift for drawing the reader into the very emotions of the characters is amazing! As is her ability to reveal all the layers of the soul, bit by bit until discovery and redemption are not only found but felt.As with all things, with great gifts come great responsibilities, however. If we, the readers, are drawn into the heart of a tortured soul, we need also be allowed to experience the process of redemption with him/her (ipso facto the romance part) In \\"Once and Always\\", I don't believe we were adequately given that. Jason is a deeply tortured soul who treats the innocent and kind-hearted Victoria despicably, using every cruel method he can find to push her away, while shackling her to him at the same time. Victoria doesn't understand and tries all she can think of to soften and heal him to no avail. McNaught's gift with emotions made this very hard to read. It all would be worth it, however, if we could see and feel Jason's remorse and restitution on his road to redemption as thoroughly as we see his atrocities.Unfortunately redemption came with very little explanation (can someone PLEASE tell me how having sex again right after raping someone will make it all better?) with the heroine immediately capitulating (no argument whatsoever) and riding happily into the sunset. That just leaves a bad taste in the mouth, in spite of the near-redeeming incident in the last few pages (which ALMOST raised this to a 4 star)."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I first picked up this book when I was in fifth grade-I stole it from my aunt and hid it from my parents. I loved it. I have read it many times since, and I still love it. It's not my favorite romance novel by any means, but Once and Always has some things rarely present in other books of its jaunre: solid structure, implication and subtlety. The book makes sense, yet it's not simple. Judith McNaught is the only romance novelist who, to my mind, has accomplished this task; she has the same sort of success with Paradise as well.Jason is the most sympathetic McNaught hero simply because he is so well drawn. He has many layers; he says one thing but you know he means another. He has motivation and his motivation MAKES SENSE; we know he loves Victoria all along though we're never told exactly that until the end. SUBTLETY: Jason's actions often speak louder than written words.I don't think this romance is at all cut and dry, and readers are selling this novel short probably because they just don't get it. Something Wonderful's hero, Jordan is much sexier and appealing because he's much less complicated, just as Something Wonderful, the book, is much less complicated and therefore more appealing. Once and Always is not whimsical, while whimsical is Something Wonderful's defining term. Something Wonderful is my favorite romance novel of all time, and I couldn't care less that it is improbable, but Once and Always has virtues that Something Wonderful doesn't even attempt to approach.Once and Always is a dense romance to be sure. McNaught has achieved something here that most romances don't even seek to accomplish and many great classic novelists fail to achieve. McNaught is a romance novelist beyond the pale. Her writing is not senstaional or lyrical or beautiful, and she relies on many of the same phrases in all of her books. There is, however, strength to her writing and her characters; she is consistently witty though never hilarious. Even more to her credit, she is rarely stupid. McNaught is no James or Faulkner or Nabokov, but she writes romance better than anyone.Aside from Once and Always, Paradise, Something Wonderful, and Double Standards are my favorite McNaught novels. Perfect and Almost Heaven are less convicing but they are generally entertaining. I am not a Fan of Whintney, My Love, though the novel was McNaught's first great success; sex is used as a weapon in this novel as it is in Until You, and I can't condone that, especially where I am looking for fantasy and love.Once and Always is a great romance, and I highly suggest it as a great away to pass the day. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I found this book slow moving and repetitive. The characters were not likeable and one note. It was difficult to see what connected them. Their relationship felt like quite a stretch and hard to believe. I found this relationship and some of the scenes more abusive than Whitney my love yet I didn't read of any outcries when I was looking into this book. A forgettable novel that I am glad to be finished with."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I think this book, along with \\"Something Wonderful\\" is one of Judith McNaught's best historical novels. I liked the \\"tortured\\" hero Jason and Victoria was a funny and endearing character. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I felt bad about what happened to Andrew at the end. After all the times his name is mentioned; he only appears twice, once in the beginning and then in the end, where he basically gets his heart broken. Other than that, good read and well written!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I bought this book thinking it was something else, but inspite of this loved the story line so much that I stayed up all night reading it.The heroin was beleivable and loveable, the minor characters were quirky and helpful and the hero was a great example of a fellow worth saving. Definitely a worthy addition to any Romance readers collection."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This book made me laugh and it made me cry. I actually BURST out laughing at the part when Victoria went to Captain Farrell's house and confided in him about the problems she was having with Jason in their marriage and how 'distant' Jason has been with her. Farrell's reaction to Victoria's innocent explanations of each situation was was hysterical to me. I don't remember ever laughing out loud before while reading a romance novel! But this part did it for me! Victoria was adorable! Well done!!Jason was not your usual romance hero. He really held out to the end on this book. He was just deathly afraid of loving. He never had real love in his life. Ever. But...that does not justify his abusive nature. He truly was a horrid man the way he mistreated innocent Victoria. He sure looked like your typical 'dream man', but his character was abusive and mean. Of course, that is part of the appeal of this book. To finally break thru and melt that icy coating on his heart. I knew Victoria would make that happen, but it was frustrating putting up with him thru his mean episodes. But a romance book always has a happy ending. This book was really a treat to read. It was a page turner and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Great story as always by Judith McNaught.

Anyhow for a first time read I must admit, it was a page turner. I laughed, cried and got a little angry with the characters, so I bargain I got my monies worth. But the one problem I had was with Victoria's sister Dorothy, yes I know she was a supporting character, but I felt as though I wanted to get to know her better and didn't get the opportunity because she seemed to always be packed off to some distant land. And at the end of the story I got the impression that there was going to be a follw up story all about her, but there doesn't seem to be any and to be honest the ending was bad it left me with a few unanswered questions. Did anyone else feel that way ?"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This novel was really breathtaking. I love the way Tory (the heroine) was determined to make Jason happy. She certainly wasn't the typical heroine we always read about. Throughout the story, it was so sweet how Jason slowly opened up to her. What can i say but he's very sweet and &quot;gentle&quot;. I gave it a four star because I thought a certain &quot;key&quot; character's presence in one of the scene was very short. It left me saying, &quot;That's it?&quot; It didn't bother me THAT much but I also thought the ending was quite rushed.

I wish she would write more historical romances set in the regency era."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I admit that Judith McNaught has a flair for drama, and I stopped reading her books after finishing Kingdom of dreams, coz that was just SO corny for me. But I started reading again and found out that \\"Once and Always\\" is the perfect, new beginning for me. Of course, as a McNaught, u'll never run out of those witty come-backs or some of her oh-god-how-i-love-you-so lines from the main characters, and an over the top climax. When I read McNaught, I forget about realism and I get carried away with the emotions she worked up on both her characters and her readers. But even as I love this book, there are still some flaws. I read some stories where the father lost his son and that will be the main conflict in the story where the hero has a hard time getting over the incident. Here, I find it difficult to believe that Jason has felt something genuine for Jamie, his son. He didn't even cry when he died, yet he did cry when he thought Victoria died. I know it made the plot a little easier to maneuver, but I thought that part was a little bit shallow. Anyway, I still gave this book 5 stars not because of technical or moral weaknesses but because u'll surely enjoy this book and fall in love with it just like I did."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I loved this story.

Read it,I'm sure it will be the best you have read."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"i actually bought and read the book due to your review i would not dare to tell you how to think or feel as this is absolutely impossible but unlike you i loved this book and get really frustrated when people scream rape and racism when i read a book of a certain era i want to feel the atmosphere and all it entails many people are offended as they think with their 2012 brain if you think of what that era entailed ofcourse he'd force his rights on her and of course the brits of the era would see the people of india not favourably i lived in south africa and they were hated up until Mr Mandela was freed and people are offended about the 1800 or how a guy of the highest nobility stunningly rich extremely handsome 30 years old would force himself on the stunningly beautiful 18 year old? that said i also believe these are what they are stories a few moments of escape in a make believe world like you would enjoy a disney story line even though other would argue cartoons are violent too !!but if we are to take all 2012 political beliefs then where would the escape be and if we were to show the 1800 era noone bathed that often so there you have it these books bring out our own thought and secret wants the rape scenes for me represent that guy we always wanted feared possible by some inexperience at a young age but still hoped in some way to make ours the racism if everyone is really honest out there we all have some form of racism in us or experience it everyday it is human nature!!! i hope books like this continue to be written it was a wonderful few hours for me!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I had heard a lot about this author but I never really remembered reading anything by her. There was a time when I used to devour one romance novel a day, so it might be possible that I have read one of her books. Anyway, this one sounded good. I have to say the summary at the back is kind of misleading.Victoria and her sister Dorothy are orphaned at he age of 18 and 17 respectively when their parents die in an accident (Horse carriage). Having no one else to look after them their doctor finds out that their mother was royalty, daughter of a countess. So he sends them from America to England to their cousins.The cousins turn out to be Charles who is an elderly Duke and Jason who is a young and troubled Marquess. Charles wants Victoria and Jason to get married but they both hate each other at sight. Jason does not want another women in his life after his ex wife deceived him and Victoria does not want an arrogant and rude man as her husband, besidesshe already has a man called Andrew back home. She is sure he will be coming to get her as soon as he returns home and discovers she is gone.The story basically revolves around these two. I loved her writing style and I do believe I have found another favorite Romance writer. The book could have been reduced in length at least by 100 pages though. Victoria was a lovely, vivacious, lively character and although I loved her she was almost too good to be true. Jason was a very nicely fleshed out character and I could very well understand why he behaved the way he did.I have 2 things I would like to mention here though.Firstly I was very sad that the author decided to make use of the stereotypical and ignorant descriptions of the Indians. She describes them as ragged beggars. I mean come on. As one reviewer on Amazon puts it perfectly\\"Throughout generations and even now the dominant religion in India has been Hinduism. So why were the \\"poverty stricken dirty Indians\\" dragged into the sadistic torture of a white British(who by the way unjustly occupied India during that era and tortured the rightful citizen and looted the country) Christian boy?\\"She also mentions that India is always hot. This is something I have read in so many novels and I thought I should really mention something this time. The author is writing about Delhi and yes, India is a tropical country and it is hot. But it is not always hot, in fact Delhi has very severe winters. I wish the authors could check the facts first.Also, there is a tone in the novel that suggest that Americans are better than the British and although one can argue the fact by saying that the hero and her Uncle are British, they seem to be the exception. Overall I found it a little offending even though I am not British. I don't know if I'm being too sensitive here, but if you've read this book ad you're not an American, you could let me know.In spite of my complaints, Once and Always was entertaining. I'll definitely be reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"1815 EnglandONCE AND ALWAYS is a wonderful engaging tale of finding love and overcoming emotional difficulties.

This is that good as well."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"this is a great story about two very strong characters(Jason and Victoria.)

Thank you Ms. McNaught, but please write more historical romance."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Where do I even begin? I have read all of McNaught's works a million times over but Once and Always holds a special place in my heart. McNaught is a GENIUS when it comes to storytelling. I love the complex, deep and passionate characters in this novel. The book is incredibly witty, clever and emotional. It will leave you smiling, laughing and crying within seconds of one another. If you haven't read any of her other works, I strongly recommend you do - they're simply spellbinding."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This book was... incredible.It was intoxicating from the very start. How can you not be hooked by a book that starts off with a wife taunting her husband about her lover... and him... supringly not choking her out!!! I abso loved Jason. I really felt like he was the best of McNaught's characters. well... other than Nikki... but im not going to go into how dispointed i was with his story.SO, the story is about a beatiful American girl, Victoria, who is suddenly orphaned, along with her sister. SHe is sent to live with distant English realitives, and end up with the man who loved her Mother, and his illigellenment son, Jason Feilding, who son and faithless wife was killed years before in a ship accident.Although, Victoria is set on Marrying a boy from her villiage (like Whitney from Whitney, my love), she can't fight the attraction she feels for JAson, and try as he might... he can't ignore her.THe story is beautifully written, and the love is so vivid, it will have you yearning for your own once and always kind of love. I've read my fair share of books, but i have the pleasure of saying this one is one of my all time faves!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"The heroine was easy to like, the hero was NOT. I ended up skipping a dozen pages at a time after the first third of the book because I got so tired of how mean the hero was. I have NO idea why the heroine could love him. He was just plain awful. I plowed through to the end, since I had spent money on the book, and normally like Judith McNaught, but this book is NOT a keeper. In fact, it was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"McNaught is a wonderful writer. I first read this book when I was in elementary school after having found it at a used book sale, the cover dog-eared and the spine covered in creases. Given that I practice family law, one can become cynical about love and marriage. But, I always reread this inspirational story every few years to renew my faith in love (corny but true). The story is fast-paced, the dialogue and banter light and witty, the descriptions a lovely escape from the everyday (has anyone ever visited Chatsworth - that's Wakefield in my mind). Additionally, the secondary characters, though not all of them, are fleshed out. All of these features complement the heavier, emotion-laden scenes--and here McNaught excels, she really knows how to wring every emotion out of you. &lt;&lt;Spoiler>> Many reviewers have commented that this story is darker, more haunting than McNaught's other novels--with good reason, as McNaught herself said in a blog, she wrote this novel after her husband died in an accident and she was still grieving. She noted that the scene toward the end of the novel where Jason locks himself in his study captured her own very personal anguish at the time.I like Jason's character because he's more complex than your typical alpha male - I don't like alpha males who don't have some underlying reason for their behavior. Despite his tough and brusque demeanor, his character was so touchingly vulnerable. Despite being a marquess, his is not the traditional upbringing of the haute ton hero. Most peers would not have grown up in abject poverty, suffered constant abuse as a child, had to teach themselves to read and write, and spent a good portion of their lives as a sailor and later, a merchant and shipper. Most Regency aristocrats inherited their wealth or married into it and all the while, they had capable estate managers to assist them. Jason came into all of his wealth on his own after a few apprenticeships (for his title did not come with money) and he had the hunger and determination not just to survive a painful childhood, but to succeed. If this were a contemporary novel, someone who suffered and lost as much as he did would need boatloads of therapy before he would be able to trust, let alone, love anyone.Suffice it to say, in addition to not following the typical path to becoming a marquess, had Jason grown up in an aristocratic household with a mother, aunt, nanny, sisters or some other more loving female role model--had he not been treated so badly by the woman who raised him and his first wife, perhaps he would not have developed the cynical belief that all women are either crazy or conniving gold-diggers. It explains why he holds women in such low regard and treats them so badly. Even after he came into his wealth and title and moved to England, nothing in the aristocracy's rules and social mores would have contradicted that belief. So, it is understandable why he refuses to get close to anyone as a way to shield himself from getting hurt. McNaught does a subtle job of cluing the reader into Jason's feelings because you need to read between the lines that all of his words and actions were an attempt to disguise or hide his growing attraction and eventually, love for Victoria.As for the heroine, Victoria, she's such fun to read about because she's just so plucky. She is perfect for Jason because she shares two things in common with him, she is an outsider looking in on aristocratic society in Regency London and she's suffered loss. For these reasons, she can empathize with his sense of loneliness. But the other wonderful thing about her is that her personality is the polar opposite of Jason's--she is warm and trusting because she grew up in a warm and loving household and a community that valued family and marriage. Having a father who worked for a living, she values work. She is someone who does not place a great value on material things or social status but instead values family, friendship, and relationships. When she finally falls for Jason, it's such a lovely thing because she loves him for him, not only for his title and wealth.While Victoria might have come across as too forgiving, I felt that it was an important key to her character that Victoria had an enormous capacity to give and therefore, love. It is this ability that allows her to look beyond Jason's callous words and actions and sense how alone and desperate for love he is even if he is not consciously aware that he craves it. In addition to her capacity to love, she has a lot of stubbornness and determination which equips her for the challenge of taming someone so hardened. I was rooting for her to win Jason's heart and as a result, change him for the better.My one complaint is that you don't fully learn about Jason's past until well into the novel but then again, the realization unravels for the reader in the same manner it unfolds for the heroine, making the subsequent scenes that much more poignant. If you're someone looking for a good roller-coaster of a Regency romance novel, pick this up--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"i decided to try this book after reading all the comments made. however, I had a really hard time deciding whether I actually loved this book. i think my major problem was with the hero, Lord Jason Fielding...ugh i don't know if i would ever think of him as a hero. He certainly was one complicated fellow. At first you glimpse him as this heartless ass who doesn't care about anything at all. I will say that as the book progressed, he did soften but his treatment of Victoria was sometimes disgusting. I don't know what Victoria could see in him but in the end it did work out. I won't go into too much detail about the plot because it would take away from the first opinion of people reading this book. I think that Victoria was a great character, even with everything going on she always stayed sane. Jason, well you come to understand why he is the way he is but i couldn't say i liked him more or even like the other great Judith McNaught Men, but all in all the book was an okay read. tho i will say that after finishing the book i didn't know if i had even enjoyed it or not..."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is one of my favorites of Judith McNaught.

McNaught's ability to create such amazing love stories is beyond me!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"this book is simply wonderful. i liked that there is more emotion placed on BOTH characters. jason and tory are not perfect people, both have their own personal demons to battle especially upon becoming married to each other. but they are perfect for one another.as is denoted by a McNaught novel, this story is laden with heart-wrenching scenes and unforgettable lines. we all know that in the end the couples always end up with one another in such romance books, but there's just something inexplicably unique in having characters (esp sexy, hunky, de-lish heroes) with flaws. jason is a very embittered and cynical man and having him commit a grievous sin against tory (which i also hated and is very controversial) just shows that not every romance tale is perfect.i must admit that the ending was quite weak. it felt as if it was written in a hurry. but all-in-all, i really loved this story. hmmm...not as good as Until You, though..."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"&quot;Once and Always&quot; was a good story. I love the way that Judith McNaught takes her time in letting you really know the characters..she doesnt skimp when in comes to character development..I love this about her. Victoria and Jason were definitely interesting and well written. I enjoyed their story, but I cant say that this was one of my favorites by McNaught. I had a few problems with Jason. He was INCREDIBLY difficult to like. I did feel a softening towards him as I came to understand him better, but I never felt like I could embrace his character 100% .....I was also bothered by the character of Andrew..I hate it when another suitor is thrown into a story and he is more endearing than the hero!! I also felt that the ending was thrown together too quickly. All in all a pretty good read, but not my favorite.."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This by far my favorite romance novel. I have read it multiple times and still enjoy it just as much each time. I love Judith McNaught's writing and this is her best. I envy those who haven't read it because they get to experience anew when they do."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"My friend lent me this book to read because I am just getting into Romance novels and it is now one of my favorite books! It was so wonderfully romantic, and Jason was so perfect. I recommend this book to anyone who loves romance or is just getting into the genre. I am going to buy my own copy so I can have it in my library, otherwise my friend would never see it again."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Mcnaught has to be one of the greatest romance author I have ever encountered. Every book by her is just too good to put down till the end. I love it how she is able to combine humor and romance but at the same time never bore the readers. I love how I can relate to the characters through out the whole story ... its almost as if the characters are real and you wish that you cold be there with them or be them. Simply amazing."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"&quot;Once and Always&quot; was the first novel I've read by Ms. McNaught! Once I opened the novel, I couldn't put it down! Finished it in one day! Ever since then, I've continue to purchase more of her work, and LOVED it!! Ms. McNaught, love all your Westmoreland characters!!! Please continue to produce more work based on these type of characters and love stories."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"By this point in Judith McNaught's career, one would thinkshe had developed a story line she's comfortable with andsimply modify it a tad from novel to novel. Nope. McNaughtjust keeps on creating, though retaining her hallmark offlawed, endearing principal and supporting characters andbeautifully scripted plots.The lovers this time around are Jason Fielding and VictoriaSeaton. The chief trouble is: they don't know they're supposedto be lovers. Uncharming, impenetrable Jason feels incapableof love, while Victoria is all too capable--with another man.The two dance around each other and Charles Fielding,convinced his son and distant cousin belong together.By the end of the novel, you will be convinced, too."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Ok, I know that the male heroes in Judith McNaught's novels are brooding and dark, with deep secrets that explain why they are who they are etc. But for me this one took it just a bit too far with the wedding night rape scene. And at the end, when through a series of elaborate misunderstandings the hero realizes the heroine isn't dead, it seems like he wants to beat her senseless for scaring him! Um, this one was just a little too angsty/ravishment fantasy/weird for me. Ms. McNaught, you grossed me out.Interestingly, I read this novel for a class on popular literature, and I was looking forward to reading something fun for class. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Mcnaught is able to bring such emotion to these characters. I wanted them so much to find happiness. I just felt bad for Andrew and when the book ended, my thought was \\"What about Andrew?\\" Regardless, I enjoyed the story all the way through - very enjoyable read. As far as the \\"rape\\" some other reviewers complained about, I didn't see it. When I read those reviews, my first thought was \\"huh?\\" I remember a lack of caring and gentleness but not a rape. So, I guess what we read is definitely open to interpretation and one must also remember context, and time period. Recommend! Finished Whitney, My Love 2 days ago and recommend it as well - like it so much I picked this one up and read it immediately."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I wish this had been the first book I read by Judith McNaught because if it had been, I would have instantly become a fan! But anyhow, I absolutely adore this book because to me the story is believable and the characters are well written. I absolutely adore Jason simply because he isn't your typical dark romance hero who deep inside is still really Fabio. He's damaged goods but still a diamond in the rough. When you finally figure out why he acts the way he does, I assure you... you will weep for this man!I would admit, this novel isn't really for everyone. It has its violent moments and the fact that Jason rapes Victoria the first time they do it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.What got me the most is the pacing! I love the fact that the author took her time with the pacing and the romance between the two characters. When he first meets Victoria he is mildly interested and just scoffs it as being just a lusty thing instead of the usual \\"Bham Wham, I think I am obsessed with you!\\". Instead no, he still sees his mistress, he doesn't really treat Victoria any differently and he still lives his own life. It's a slow process for the two of them as they finally come to terms with the feelings within them.The story is pretty similar in vein and feel to 'Whitney, My love' but unlike Clayton (who to be honest, I don't really like) Jason Fiedling actually HAS reason to have trust issues and to be dark and brooding. If you enjoyed Whitney, My love only to feel cheated because of how irritatingly silly the story gets after they're married then please give 'Once and Always' a try!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this book from front to back, it took me from start to finish in one read. A natural page-turner.This book is fast-paced, not lagging during scenarios or lacking in wit. The heroine, Victoria or Tory for short, is a rare delight to read about and it is very amusing to read her attempts to 'seduce' her husband, whilst being very innocent about the whole thing. This being because of years of witnessing her parents loveless, but happy marriage, she assumes that Jason will want to do the things that they had, such as play chess and read together. Her arguments with Jason are aplenty in this book, and range from being very hurtful, to simply teasing and humourous. A big plus to the story, it was very sweet and funny to read about. That said, the reformation of Jason was very moving.The downside is, there isn't much focus on Jason himself. His past is extremely heart-wrenching, and it definately did soften my attitute towards him, not to mention that it did sadly justify his actions and words towards Victoria. The other thing that made me rate this book with a 4 star instead of 5, is that of the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending is very touching and fitting as well, but it was too short compared to all the bumps in the road Victoria had to get over to get there.I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance with characters you actually feel for. It's a wonderful, easy-breezy read that you can't help but enjoy and delight in."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"It enthralls me to the story from start to end. Actually, all Judith Mcnaught books are good.But this is as good as Almost Heaven.JM has contributed to the deterioration of my eyesight. Nonstop reading from morning to night, resting only when I take a bath!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Much like its title, Once and Always, had captured my heart the first time I its covers and kept it ever since (ok, so it's not exactly like the title...)This book, have always been to me, one of JM's most treasurable masterpieces. Only she can create characters that can make some of the stupidest mistakes yet still redeem themselves and become perfect again by the end of the book.Victoria's gentle courage and beautiful nature is something that I, as a female, have always strived to be. And despite Jason's flaws and mistakes, he is still one of those men (a JM man) who melts your heart and makes you love him all the same.I know that some other reviewers have some major complaints about the main characters. And despite Jason and Victoria has dug themselves into my heart and earned a place there for all time, I am not blind to their faults. I do not deny that Jason and Victoria may have some flaws but these flaws did not ruin my image of them, but only seemed to endear them further in my eyes. No one's perfect and I doubt there are not many people who wants to read about perfect heroes and heroines who never make any mistakes. But JM's characters come as close as they could to perfection without making them seem unrealistic and unbelievable. Jason and Victoria are two of JM's most splendid and unbelievable creations (and if you read JM, you will know that's not just any compliment) who will stay with you forever.The only, ONLY complaint I ever had of O&amp;A is that it ended too soon. It is my only favorite JM book without the famous JM trademark ending. And I pray for the day that she would extend the ending to O&amp;A like she did Whitney, My Love.Once and Always is a story of two people who finds love when they least expected or wanted it. It is a fairy tale that tells of a courageous, young woman who brings light and laughter to the home and heart of a man who had long forgotten the meaning of love.Once and Always is a story that will melt even the coldest heart and make even the most skeptical cynic believe in the magic of love and the beautiful world of Judith McNaught."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Jason and Victoria are one of my favorite couples ever--and I've read a lot of Romance Novels. Victoria is a tender hearted beauty who despite her fears helps Jason heal from past wounds. Jason is not the most entertaining of Judith's heroes. However, his vulnerability hidden by a hard exterior draw you to him. I love the devious uncle in this book and am thankful he has the couple's best interest at heart."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I love this book! The part about Jason's childhood absolutely broke my heart! I also loved how Jason had such a hard time accepting the gift from Victoria--it was so sweet! I would definately recommend this book to anyone who loves romances as much as me!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This was my first JM book and none of her other (nor any other Historical Romance/Modern Romance authors) novels have lived up to it. That's how great I think the book is. I've read it over and over again, I'm pretty sure I'll wear it out in another year or so and I'll have to but another one. I hate those &quot;Perfect Romance&quot; novels, where everyone always has a perfect life and when they eventually get together it just becomes &quot;perfecter&quot;. This is truly touching, chokes a laugh out of you at one chapter and a sob at another. It is a must."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"With just the introduction of Jason Fielding and Victoria Seaton, I automatically fell in love with this novel. Judith McNaught has created a magnificent work of art that is &quot;clearly destined for greatness.&quot; I consider this novel to be the closet thing to perfection. I was not surprised that I found myself laughing and crying along with the characters. Ms. McNaught has once again been able to draw her readers into a dream. This is truly one of her best piece of writings yet! Theses characters have managed to spark every emotion inside me through their tender gestures. The love between Jason and Victoria has the ability to enchant readers everywhere. I highly recommend this novel but only if you are willing to witness a piece of perfection!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Judith McNaught was at her best when she wrote this story. I am a dedicated fan of Ms. McNaughts and this story captured my heart from the first page until the last. The characters were so real.

I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"i love this book. it was the one that got me hooked on judith mcnaught. it's perfect. jason's a jerk, but can't help but love him. victoria's naive and innocent, but can't help but love her too. i love that you can pinpoint the exact moments when these two fall in love with each other. i fell in love with them too. no spoilers here, if you love pure romance, then, this is the book for you! i read this book 10 years ago and it still haunts me!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I very rarely write reviews because books, like paintings, are such subjective forms of art.Having written that, I must say that I agree 100% with \\"slmchicago\\" aka L. McCreadie's Dec. 31/04 review. She summed up all of my frustrations with the book completely. I heartedly think you should take time to read her review.My biggest issue was with the fact that Jason kept going back to his mistress to satisfy his \\"needs\\" well after he was aquainted and \\"supposedly\\" enamoured of the heroine. Had I not have read the fabulous \\"Whitney My Love\\" or my personal favourite \\"Almost Heaven\\" I would have given up based on this distasteful proclavity in the hero's character; especially when his relationship with his mistress is by far more tender and passionate than that which he eventually has with the heroine.This was the reason I gave up on Judith Ivory's The Beast. In that book the hero's mistress was married. How can a person fall for a hero who has no moral barometer? It is very off-putting to me as a reader since I can never quite believe that the hero will be faithful to the heroine in the long run.I read romances for the fantasy that \\"love conquers all.\\" If I wanted to read about marital infidelity I'd choose Jackie Collins.A disappointed McNaught fan......."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"There are some very good reviews of this book following, so I will be brief with my 2 cents worth! I love Judith McNaught's writing and this is a very good book - well conceived and convincing. If you are new to her brilliant romances, I would suggest you read Something Wonderful or Almost Heaven first. Although these Regency Romances are all from the same time period and have some common threads, Once and Always is a little darker and more disturbing. The characters are well developed and Jason's cruelty toward Victoria and mistrust of women in general is explained well as the story enfolds. Having said that, there are some very disturbing sex scenes in this book. I think Jason Fielding is the only one of Judith's alpha male characters that can make Clayton (Whitney My Love) look like a choir boy! While this is not my favorite McNaught book, I still have to give it 5 stars for an excellent storyline and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I have just read the book for the fourth time... Can't get enough of it... The way the relationship between Jason and Vistoria grows everyday makes me wonder whether I'll ever find a love like this... The construction of the characters, psychologically, is wonderful, balancing the perfection aura with the depths of our own feelings towards love... It makes you laugh, cry, smile, sigh and, mostly, enjoy yourself truly and deeply"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"probably one of my all time favorite books! i have lost count of the number of times i have reread it. i wish ms mcnaught would go back to historicals. i love the way the stroyline developes, from antagonists to lovers. i am a sucker for a happy ending and this is one the best! if you haven't read it, do so, yu won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"He rapes her on her wedding night and then feels like a schmuck only because he realizes she was a virgin. Because raping non-virgins is ok?! And then he forces her again later?!no thanks."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I can't help but give Judith McNaught 5 stars, yet again. This story really touched me. It seemed different that most McNaught books, but still had the same quality she adds to all of her works. This is a darker story about a man with an unfortunate and terrible childhood that haunts him to adulthood, and about an American woman suddenly orphaned in the world with no place to go but to England where the last of her unknown relatives live. Jason Fielding and Victoria \\"Tory\\" Seaton are definately made for one another in this story of unconditional love. Jason is a hard character to understand. He isn't very nice to Victoria and is actually indifferent to her through almost the entire novel, BUT to know Jason is to read between the lines and Judith wove his story where if you look close enough you do know what he is feeling and thinking. His actions speak louder than his words through most of the book, (which Judith wrote in there earlier on as I can remember, and I took this as a hint from her to do exactly that) and it's frustrating for Victoria who doesn't understand him any better than the reader does. She only hints subtly at his feelings, leaving us loving him, but still hating him because well...we just don't know what to make of him just as Tory doesn't either. Judith led us along finding things out about Jason and his past as Tory discovered them, which I believed heightened the emotion throughout. When I read the part about Captain Farell's conversation with Tory about Jason's childhood I had to sit the book down and take it all in for a while before I could continue, which is I'm sure how Victoria was feeling too. I felt so protective over Jason even though he, more than not, came across as a complete arrogant, unfeeling, jerk...because I felt the pain in his cold heart and the pain he knew could drive a sane man mad, but it didn't because he's so strong. It was beautiful watching while Tory slowly melted the icy wall he had built over his heart and to learn what real love is, because he'd never truly known it. I won't give too much away, but this poor man had been through so much and Judith made us wait and wait and beg that he would open up to the love Tory was willing to give before it was too late. Sigh! I was truly angry at Charles for what he did to Tory in regards to Andrew. I was on the verge of tears when Andrew showed up there all smiling, so happy he was getting to see Victoria after all that time. Arg..it still makes me mad to think of it. BUT at the same time, if it hadn't been for what Charles did Jason would have probably died lonely and bitter because he would have never sought out love on his own without it being thrust in his face the way it was. Some things in the book irked me...there wasn't an Epilogue and I wanted to know what happened to Andrew, I really wanted to see that he turned out ok. I also wanted to know if she gave him the son he wanted. Maybe Judith felt an epilogue would take away from the haunting qualities the book held. I doubt she wanting to tie it all up in a nice neat little happy bow because this book wasn't like that, it was dark, brooding, emotional and lovely. This book does leave you haunted, but feeling hopefull as well. The writing in the book is excellent and I recommend it to any Judith fan, she definately doesn't dissapoint with her historicals. I hate that this book had to end and I wish I could read more about Jason and Victoria because I felt the ending was just the beginning for them. Once you get this book you won't be able to put it down...just a warning. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"I must admit that I was skeptical about reading a *gasp* romance novel when my friend came to me with Once and Always. But after reading a couple of chapters, I was and still am hooked. Basically Judith McNaught has taken every romantic fantasy that I've had and put them into this one historic novel. Victoria, a fiery American, goes to England to live with a distant cousin, Jason Fielding, a dark man with a disturbed past. And, of course, they inevitably fall in love. The tension between the two is unbearable and wonderful at the same time. I've never been so emotionally involved with a book and never before have I been in love with a fictional character as I now am with Jason Fielding. A must read for the hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"This is my first Judith McNaught romance. I found the story engaging...the two young daughters of an Irish American doctor and his wife who was from British aristocracy (though the daughters don't know it) are taken to England when their parents die, each given to a different relative. The oldest, Victoria, has been in love with Andrew, the prominent son of a wealthy New York family, her whole life. Andrew has loved her and taught her to hunt, fish shoot and ride. He vows to wed her when she's of age and has told her he loves her and will always love her. She loves and trusts him. But her parents die and she is shipped to England while he's on a trip to Europe. Meanwhile, there's a conspiracy to marry her to her cousin, Jason Fielding, the bastard son of an English Duke who was once in love with Victoria's mother. And Victoria believes Andrew has married another. So, she reluctantly weds Jason. (Frankly I was pulling for the Marquis de Salle at that point. At least he cared for her and was a kind man.) The story was fast paced and intriguing for the most part, but here are the problems: Jason, the ostensible hero, is less appealing than Andrew whose love never failed Victoria. I kept wanting her to end up with Andrew. If the author was trying to say Jason was better for her, she didn't convince me. And then there was Jason's wedding night rape (that is what is was if you read the description and it offended me), his trying to pay for her affections with jewelry as if she was one of his whores, and his continuing to sleep with his mistress after the wedding. Who could ever love a guy like that? Jason was a cad...a mean cad. I kept wanting Victoria to just throw him over. I don't care if he had a difficult childhood or that he was sexy. So what? And when he later tells Victoria he loved her when he married her, it just didn't ring true as his actions said otherwise. Jason's consistently arrogant, surly behavior was too much for me. His big turnabout at the end was anticlimactic. Victoria was a bit too nice for me as well. And everyone's trying to justify the deceit perpetrated on Victoria in the name of matching her with the guy they thought best was just revolting. A good story gone bad. I should add that what makes it so difficult to review this author's works is that she really is a good writer so if she can overcome the story issues she'd clearly be a 5 star author."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Once and Always is a book with many twists and turns and more importantly a book with characters that a person can relate to.Victoria Seaton is an American, orphaned and alone with only her sister. She soon finds that she has realitives in England that are willing to take her and her sister in but the sisters are seperated. Victoria, has to adjust to a new country with new rules and did I mention she's almost betrothed?Jason Fielding is the bastard son of the Duke of Atheron, Victoria's cousin who is masquerading as the Duke's nephew. He is cold and cynical of life and most of all woman. To him there is only one use of a woman and then after that they're no longer of value.However, there are two matchmakers at work and both seem to be at odds with each other. The Duke of Artheron is determined to pull the greatest match of the year but the Dowager Duchess of Clairemont, Victoria's grandmother has the same intentions but with Tory's sister Dorthy.From the moment Jason and Victory meet, sparks fly and tensions are high. Can these two really walk away from each other with the mechanics of the matchmaking Duke of Atheron looking over their shoulders?"},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Once and Always is about, a girl called Victoria, who has lost everything she once loved and everyone she once cared for including, Andrew, the man who she once believed she would marry. The only person that remains, to whome she can turn to is, her uncle Charles Fielding (i thought that a lil wierd to but never mind...) She comes to his home with nothing and is greeted by the coldness of a young man, Jason Fielding, whose panther like characteristics enthrall and capture Victoria. However his troubled past and the unfaithfulness of his previous wife angers his heart and he no longer knows what it is to love and to be loved. Victoria enters his life unexpectadly and turns everything upside down. Causing him to feel things he thought were long dead. The story is long (which i found exciting) and is a page turner. McNaught creates characters that one wishes for; a woman who is strong in her character and fights for what she wants regardless of the barriers and a man who once learns to love, will continue to do so always."},{"Title":"Once and Always","review":"Jason never jumped off page for me like Clayton or Zach.

Inflected languages are so foreign to an English speaker that every little bit helps. I understood Latin much better after learning Russian. Since Russian has more cases, they are more logical (in my opinion). In a similar way, the presentation of cases in this book makes everything clearer by comparing the two languages. For me, when I compared the different inflected languages I could get to the basic meaning of each case, instead of just memorizing individual functions. I also learned in this book that \\"accusative\\" is a bad translation of the term used by the Greeks, which is why it doesn't make much sense.

Though only mentally functioning like a child, Toby is a dedicated helper doing his chores diligently like washing store windows and taking out the trash.Thus when Bretta Solomon, owner of the flower shop, learns that her conscientious helper died from hornet bites, she takes it personally perhaps because her late spouse Carl was a deputy sheriff. Bretta wonders why anyone would kill the harmless Toby by planting the deadly nest inside his room. The only possible motive she can think of must be Agnes' odd-looking flowers that someone stole from the deceased woman's garden. She ponders whether these flowers can be valuable enough for someone to REAP A WICKED HARVEST that led to murder. She ivestigates while also slowing down her romance with a neighbor and coping with her father's thirty-something squeeze wanting to redesign her home.This is a terrific amateur sleuth tale in which the clues are discovered by the heroine in a reasonable but clever manner. The support cast provides the eccentricities of small town living specially Bretta's battling assistants Lew and Lois who argue over everything even that critical 1960s question of Superman or Spiderman and her father with his \\"designer girlfriend\\" who becomes her cohort in sleuthing.

His erudition of this culture is unmatched and the bibliography of this book is quite a read in-itself.In this work Cartledge undertakes the massive task of tracing the history of Lacedamon from 1300-362BCE. In other words, right around the time of the mythical / quasi-historical Trojan war (1283BCE) down to the time of the decisive Spartan defeat @ the battle of Leuctra (371BCE).The reader should be advised that the opening stanzas of this book are difficult to follow. Cartledge casually alludes to endless archeological digs all over Laconia at such a rapid pace that it's apt to make the reader feel like it's information overload. While grad students in archeology and anthropology might feel right at home, the rest of us may feel a bit lost.When Cartledge arrives in the more familiar historical territory of Herodotus and Thucydides the book seems to improve a great deal. At least for me, anyway. The exegesis of historical records has always been easier for me to comprehend than the interpretation of pre-literate societal structures.One of the highlights of the book is Cartledge's discussion of the 3 classes of Spartans (Homoioi, Perioikoi &amp; Helot). I had some degree of knowledge of the Homoioi &amp; Helots before reading this work, but virtually no understanding of the Perioikoi. Thanks to his chapter on these people I now have a much better comprehension.I would recommend this book only to those who have an ambitious yearning to understand the history of the Spartans. For those who would rather have a more concise and slightly more reader-friendly work I would recommend A HISTORY OF SPARTA 950-192 by W.G. Forrest (ASIN: 0393004813). Forrest's book also goes a few hundred years past Leuctra while the present book does not.Also, it is imperative that prior to reading the present text that the reader first peruse Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon &amp; a little Plutarch mixed in wouldn't hurt. I do not think it prudent for someone to undertake the present work without at least a working knowledge of the primary sources."},{"Title":"Sparta and Lakonia: A Regional History 1300-362 BC","review":"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 31 December 2011This book was first published in 1979, with a second edition in 2002 (when I bought it and first read it). It was, and remains, THE best book on Sparta and Lakonia. It stops just after the battle of Mantinea (362 BC) but a second book by Cartledge and Spanwforth was published in 1989 (with a second edition in 2002) on Hellenistic and Roman Sparta, with Paul Cartledge doing the Hellenistic piece (the most interesting of the two, in my view).Anyway, I was very much surprised to discover that there was no review of this book on Amazon.co.uk, and decided that there needed to be one. As Paul Cartledge acknowleged some 30 years ago (perhaps with a bit of exageration), two books on Sparta are published on average every year. This one, however, is apart from almost all others, and is probably among the best of all (together with Cartledge's book on Agesilaus, which is perhaps even better).Readers should be aware that this IS VERY MUCH a scholarly book, but of the highest quality. It is a very well structured book which starts with a clear presentation of the geographical context (together with climate and boundaries). There are masses of well-drawn maps and very useful annexes.However, and above everything else, the main strongpoint of this book is the explanations it provides on Sparta's strengths and weaknesses which were the two sides of the same coin- Sparta had the largest territory of ANY Greek city, including the very rich Syracuse. This was because it add annexed Messenia and enslaved its population - the helots - virtually doubling the size of its territory in the process, and giving it the means to sustain a large number of hoplites who could spend their whole life (or at least had the means to do so) training and fighting- the associated weakness was that the helots, who were Dorians just like the Lacedemonians, retained their identity and never fully accepted their status as slaves, so Sparta always had to be on the look out and ready to put down as quickly as possible any revolt whereas the Helots would take advantage of any Spartan weakness.Several additional features for which Sparta is known in Ancient Greece are direct consequences of this:- Sparta had little need to trade, or only for specific items, and used no currency (coins of bronze, silver or gold) for a long time, simply because the size of its territory meant that it was largely self-sufficient. Unlike Athens, for instance, it did not need to import most of its food- The conquest of Messenia made Sparta self-sufficient but it alsol lead to a major reversal in its foreign policy. While Sparta had been expansionist before this conquest, simply because, with an expanding population, it needed to be, it became the most isolationist of all Greek cities once it was self-sufficient. It was always afraid of a Helot uprising as soon as its army left on campaign. A related point was that part of the army almost always had to be left at home, just in case...As Cartledge shows so clearly, drawing on Aristotle, the crisis of Sparta came because of oliganthropia: the number of full Spartans - full-time professional warriors - that the city was able to field declined almost constantly from 480 to 362. However, this was not strictly because of demographic reasons. Indeed Spartan families continued to have children, but inherintances were partible and social and financial unequalities grew so that fewer and fewer had the means to qualify as full Spartiates and casualties could not be entirely replaced. Spartans were aware of this, and tried to limit its effects as much as possible, but then they were beaten at Leuctra, lost Messenia and were never able to reconquer it...A fantastic book and a MUST READ for anyone interested in Sparta..."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I think this is one of my top ten books.

Perhaps most importantly it signifies the divisions in a family. How can a seemingly perfect family suddenly rupture and break?Our story opens with the discovery of the frozen body of a young girl in a Montana streambed. She is Abbie Cooper, missing for several years. Not only was Abbie wanted for murder but she was also pregnant at the time of her death. These questions confront Sheriff Charlie Riggs.The questions that plague Abbie's parents, Sarah and Ben, and her brother, Josh, are many - how could a young woman with such grace and intelligence become involved with a group of eco-terrorists, be wanted for murder, and die so mysteriously?Evans tells his story in flashback form returning to Abbie's growing up in New York State and her parents divorce - Ben has fallen in love with another woman. The disintegration of her parents relationship affects Abbie deeply and she is easy prey for the influence of eco-terrorist, Rolf.Of course, when Abbie's defection becomes public knowledge it's an embarrassment for the Coopers and takes a particular toll on young Josh.Able actor/writer Scott Brick gives a bravura reading of this tale of disaffection, disgrace, and final redemption.

Updike, measured against 20th century writers, was very talented. Unfortunately, 20th century lit was dominated by modernism and modernism did not die with him.Much as writers like Chuck Palahniuk herald postermodernism with every pyrotechnic word, Updike and Roth and Alice Walker and others continued plodding backward in their works.I wanted to read THE DIVIDE because of the alleged environmental substory/background. Evans is a pedestrian writer. He is trapped by modernism. Just a few pages in I told myself \\"oh my gosh, this is going to be yet another cliched modernist book: it's all about the interior monologue of some yuppie getting a divorce.\\" Pure Updike territory. I was correct. Despite the one character's connection to ecodefense, this story focuses on suburban angst. Pure, 20th century modernist lit territory. Nothing new here. Evans does not have the in-your-face language skills of a Palahniuk or even the entertaining storytelling of a William Burroughs (okay, not even Edgar Rice Burroughs), so the words just lay there on the page, as if every paragraph were regurgitated by a precocious grad student's novel-writing computer program.If you like generic thrillers written by rote - John Grisham/Dan Brown style paper-wasters - this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nick Evan's new book was very engrossing to me.

This book is so far above the usually 3 page chapter,cops and dead bodies crap that is being churned out on the best seller lists....Not a happy ending but a well written mystery! Read it, you'll love it. I'm already mentally casting the movie version, with a young William Dafoe for the part of Rolf!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Two skiers discover Abbie Cooper's body. She's been dead for some time and was found frozen in a mountain creek.At the time of her death, Abbie was wanted for murder and ecoterrorism but how did she come to be alone, shot and in an isolated area like this?\\"The Divide\\" tells the story of Abbie Cooper and her transformation from an innocent teenager who had close family ties, to a person who may have killed someone.As she was nearing the end of her high school years, Abbie's family life seemed idyllic. She and her family went on their annual vacation to a dude ranch in Montana.At the ranch, Abbie met and became attracted to a ranch hand, Ty Hawkins. One day, Ty brought Abbie to his parent's ranch, a wondrous place where his father raised horses. While there, she learned that companies were drilling for gas in the area and Mr. Hawkins has been notified about it happening on his ranch. When his family and others in the area bought their land, the government only sold them the surface rights. The government kept the mineral rights and has been leasing the land to private companies.The Cooper's ended their vacation and returned tot their home. Their lives seemed to progress on a normal level until her father, Ben, decided that he was leaving his family for another woman.This second betrayal had a simmering adverse effect on Abbie. She picked a college in the west and became involved in protest movements. This progressed into more radical movements and hardened Abbie toward corporations that she felt were harming the ecology.The author has given a well described story showing how divorce can destroy a family and that it is the children who often suffer the most. The pacing was good and Abbie was a well described character who the reader comes to feel sympathy for.While not up to the level of \\"The Horse Whisper,\\" \\"The Divide\\" was a quick and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Evan's is one of my favorite authors. I enjoy his books in part due to the setting and great stories. This book was too much soap opera. My least favorite of his books. Read \\"The Loop\\" instead."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I probably would have liked this book better if I didn't know who the author was. I was expecting, hoping for, a book as good as The Loop or Smoke Jumper. This one wasn't, IMHO. But it was still better than most books that I've read lately."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This will be a brief review -- this is the first book I've read by Nicholas Evans. Needless to say, it won't be my last. He's phenomenally adept at developing memorable characters, and weaves all the storylines of the book together is such a way that is enjoyable and smooth. I'm especially impressed with his imagery -- his writing is visceral and makes you feel emotions you typically don't experience in other books. Very impressive!!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"With the success of the Horse Whisperer, and my personal favorite, The Loop, Nicholas Evans brings us another good read!I didn't get into the book immediately, however, towards the middle I was really drawn in and couldn't wait to see where the story would go. It's a mystery about what happened to a young girl whose body was found, basically the story begins with that but then takes us back to several years before so we can see what led up to that point. We meet her family, and see from each of their points of view.Suspenseful! Great writing, interesting story. I am looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I enjoyed the first chapter of this book, but I felt a little misled when its content took a U-turn after that. The book begins with a father and son making a dangerous trek up an icy mountain during a skiing trip and accidentally finding a frozen,dead body. From there Evans weaves his elaborate story of how the body ends up on the mountain. The story is about how a cheating, middle-aged husband indirectly ruins the lives of his wife, son, and daughter (who is the body that is found on the icy mountain). By the end of the book, everyone has adjusted to being \\"dumped on\\" by the guilt-ridden husband's decision to leave the family, and they have no choice but to move on with their lives. This is nothing more than another classic story of immoral misbehavior involving a weak male character who can't improve his marriage and takes the easy way out by leaving."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"It's been years since Nicholas Evans published his mega bestseller, The Horse Whisperer, and his maturity as a writer shows. The Divide is, in my opinion, a much better book than his debut novel. The characters are equally compelling, and the reader will keep on turning pages, but the difference is in the ending: here, Evans has written what feels like the necessary conclusion to the character's journey. Unlike the cheap and horrendous stunt at the end of The Horse Whisperer, The Divide has a beautiful and powerful end. If Evans keeps on writing this way, I look forward to reading his next books."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Scott Brick gives a phenomenal reading of \\"The Divide\\", which had me not only listening in the car but too impatient to wait, bringing the disks into the house and sitting there for hours in front of the CD player listening in my family room. The unabridged version is 12 disks and 14 hours long.An actor, Brick captured the personalities and voices of dozens of characters, from a cowboy sheriff to a 16-year-old girl. It also is in the listening that you can hear the quality of Evans' writing. The book, at 416 pages, may be criticized by some as too long, too meandering or too sentimental. Read out loud, it is moving and compelling."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Undoubtedly Nicholas Evans is my favorite author, having particularly enjoyed his first three books. Was expecting greatness from this, and though I did enjoy it it had not pulled me in like the others.A great story but it felt like it was missing ... just something. Perhaps the feeling of unease was intended, because the family truly never knows what had happed with their daughter."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The Divide is the story of a family that is split by the decision of the father/husband to leave his family, and by the drift of the eldest daughter into terrorist groups.This story is quite different from the previous books by Evans. It doesn't have much to do with animals, and it goes a lot deeper into analysing the differences between men and women, human relations and how people and a family can drift apart. It is quite tragic and Evans depicts a harsh reality for his characters.I thought this story was very well written and gave an interesting insight into relationships in a couple, in a family, etc. It is quite different from the other Evans books, but well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I have become a Nicholas Evans fan. I did not read \\"The Horse Whisperer,\\" but of course saw the movie.His other two books left me liking them, but didn't seem quite as well-developed or the situations very weird.But this book. Wow! It was nothing like I was expecting, but was a fine blend of past and present and sucking you right in to care about the characters... and to see how one part of our lives can affect another, for better or worse.I found the eco-terrorism angle quite interesting and noticed the girl's name mimicks perhaps the greatest eco-terrorist of all time, Edward Abbey.It was a bit cliche near the end, when the sheriff talks to Josh, but still quite satisfying.When will the next Nicholas Evans book be out?? ;-)"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The Divide traveled everywhere with me. If my husband ran an errand and took me along, the book went too. I was enthralled by Evans' ability to build characters and his fabulous sense of setting, and most importantly, it held me until the end."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I loved the book, but it was not the good ending that I wanted. But I guess life works out that way sometimes."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Excellent book. Our book club is reading this book now. When I got pass the middle I could not put it down. Very well written."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"TOOK A WHILE TO GET THROUGH THIS NOVEL, AND EVANS IS A TALENTED AUTHOR- HOWEVER THE PLOT SEEMS TO DRAG IN THE MIDDLE, I SUPPOSE I AM BEING UNFAIR AS I TYPICALLY PREFER MYSTERIES. THIS IS FINE FOR ANYONE THAT DOES NOT LIKE TO BE STRESSED OR IN A FRENZY TO 'FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED!!!' IT JUST MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY, AND I SUPPOSE FOR SOME IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE VERY INTERESTING. IF YOU ARE AN AVID FAN OF SANDFORD, PATTERSON, ILES, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU..."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nicholas Evans has the wonderful ability to truely give charecter to landscape. In all of his books my favorite characters have been land in which the story takes place in and this one was no different.I enjoyed Abby's story and felt that she had the most depth of all the the characters. I also appreciated that Evans brought to light some of the environmental damage that is being done in some of our most beautiful areas, and how the land owners are most of the time completely unable to stop it from happening.On the other hand, I did not care in the least about the parents divorce and found the mother to be extemely unlikeable. Romance is not my cup of tea but always find Nicholas Evans to be a good read."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This was a good story but I thought it was too lengthy in the middle of the book with ongoing issues that I wasn't too interested in such as the environmental issues, etc. The beginning was good but it kind of fizzled out for me in the middle and end. Not a bad book though."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"After a bit of a slow start (too much detail about the initial discovery, I think), this one is a real page-turner, and I could not put it down. I love Evans' descriptive style and his plot is rich and well-developed.I was particularly impressed by how he got into Sarah's head in terms of her reaction to the breakup of her marriage. I've been through a similar experience, and trust me, her rage and hurt is right on the money. I was also impressed by the development of the Abbie storyline.Wonderful book, albeit somewhat depressing. I like that he didn't completely sell out with a happy ending - rather, he left the reader with the sense that these people will eventually be all right."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I was happy to have been able to purchase this GREAT book at a phenomenal price!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"How good is this novel? I absolutely loved it, devoured every page in fact. Evans writes extraordinarily well about emotions, conflict and redemption, particularly from a female point of view. It is something that has always blown me away about his books. His female characterisations are always superb and I can totally relate to them, something that puts his books several notches above many by his contemporaries.The novel's plotline of the disintegrating marriage of wealthy Long Island couple Sarah and Ben Cooper, the fallout from their separation and its disastrous effect on their young adult daughter, Abbie, is fascinating. Fuelled partly by her searing anger at her father for leaving their family and as an in-yer-face rebellion against him, Abbie falls under the spell of the sinister Rolf, a member of the Environmental Liberation Front, a domestic eco-terrorist group. Amongst other activities, Rolf torches SUV dealerships as a protest against \\"bourgeois capitalist pigs\\". Abbie, awed by the older man and angry at the world in general, starts to accompany Rolf on his torching missions. When one in Denver goes disastrously wrong, resulting in the death of a young man, Abbie and Rolf have to go on the run as they are wanted for murder. The resulting impact on her family and friends is devastating and Evans writes about this beautifully and in a way that is so sympathetic that I felt their pain with them. Interestingly, the story is told in reverse, a plot device that is remarkably effective.I highly recommend \\"The Divide\\" to one and all and I have awarded it five stars. The novel is a triumph, and I look forward to more novels from this gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This is one of the best books i've ever read. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I had read The Horse Whisperer and thought it quite good but this book is unbelievable. Living in the northwest I had heard and read about all these acts of violence and destruction but this put the newspaperarticles in perspective. What possesses these people who don't care for something going on to kill, destroy property, etc. There are lawful ways of dealing with these things. I think Nicholas Evans did a masterful jobin portraying all sides of the story. Guess I felt sorry for all but mostly for Benjamin and Josh. They seemedso at a loss to understand Jessica. But think this is another case of too much, too young. I hope Mr Evanswill continue to write..........more often. Can't remember when I felt so sorry for so many people with no ideaof what to do with this child and her anger at the world. Sorry she died so young but with the mess she hadmade of her life, don't believe she could have ever been a \\"normal\\" human being (whatever that is)."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The first two pages of The Horse Whisperer sold me on Nicholas Evans ten years ago. His descriptions bring the story to life. This is a very good story and I could feel the emotions of these characters because they have been written well. A few too many \\"F-bombs\\" in this one that seemed unnecessary, but a very good read."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This was a novel that started with the conclusion and then led the reader through the preceeding facts, so the reader was never left with anynotion that there would be a happy ending. It was the story of a somewhat over-indulged teenager whose actions brought great sadness to those around her due to her focus on what she wanted, to the disregard of her family and real friends. Those who have had teenagers will relate to the frustrations felt by her parents and sympathise with their despair as the tradegy unfolds, although the self-absorbed behaviour of the girl's father can seen to be a contributing factor to the disaster.Overall I found this good reading, a book that kept me entranced so that I read well into the night, but lacking the finesse in the development of some of the characters to make it a prize winner. But I would certainly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I found the first half of this book to be extremlely interesting and compelling. The second half; however, is boring and cliched. It only succeeded in making me angry. Abbie is the spoiled child of rich parents who engages in acts of terrorism, but never has to face the consequencese. Even when she is throwing tantrums and putting her loved ones in jail, no one ever calls her on it. I know this is supposed to be fiction, but it felt much too contrived and was very unconvincing."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The Divide is definitely a great book. Though it is not as good as Evans' Smoke Jumper, Horse Whisperer or The Loop, it is told with a precise description of feelings events and relationships. I loved it"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nothing really wrong with the writing, but somehow this just doesn't come off as a good read. Don't you hate it when you run out and buy the book the day it comes out, and spend the next three days sinking deep, deep, deeper into disappointment? He'snot quite there with the plot, the characters, what started out to be a great location, a really uninteresting marriage, a passion-less affair. Did any of the characters really stir up any tangible care and concern? Don't you want them to reach out and grab you? Don't you want to really like them? I want to care about them so much I can't put the book down. I'm sorry, but this is yet another letdown from Evans. Since THE HORSE WHISPERER, I've been a patient fan. I slogged through THE SMOKE JUMPER and THE LOOP - neither one with an ounce of the appeal of his first novel. When I heard about THE DIVIDE, I was ready to give Evans another go. Just enough time had passed to dull my disappointment with his other efforts. I'm sorry. If you're looking for another Horse Whisperer, this isn't it. I'm afraid Evans is a one trick pony."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I think this book tried to do too much. It tried to tell two stories - the breakup of a marriage, and also the descent of a college student into terrorism - and did this from four different perspectives, mother and father, daughter and son. I think that was just too much!I found the mom and dad's stories to be absolutely compelling. Their story-lines dominated the book, and for me this is what made the book a complete page-turner. However, I'm still torn between giving the book three and four stars, because it feels like there's a lot missing from the daughter Abbie's story-line. With so many other stories to tell here, Evans skimped on a very complex and difficult transition, that of a happy, straight-A, popular high school girl who so quickly becomes an angry, violent eco-terrorist. Evans TELLS us why this happens (Rolf takes advantage of a vulnerable girl), but that one-sentence explanation feels flat; I don't feel as if I've been along for the ride, watching and understanding as Abbie transforms. As a result, I have a hard time buying into that story.I loved reading about the parents, however. For me, that was an absolute page-turner. When I read the book jacket, I had a hard time imagining how this was going to make a gripping, enjoyable read - but it did! Despite the shortcomings in the Abbie story-line, I became totally absorbed in this book. It felt pretty cathartic, escaping into these characters' many, many problems, and watching as they struggled through them and sometimes triumphed. Even with my problems with the book, I'm glad I read it!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Evans books. This book is every parents nightmare but you also learn life does go on! Worth every minute."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I started this book twice before finally possessing it and reading it cover-to-cover. I am no expert reader or expert in literature. Whatever. I do know that this guy understands people. He understands how we hurt the people we pressumably care about the most... friends, family. People are whacked out. Dumbed and numbed by illicit or perfectly legal drugs. Abused and confused by tortuously inadequate and neglecting parents. Unable to truly share the dark thoughts that, I believe, haunt all of us in certain moments. Evans seems to key on these facets of human existence. At one point a character reflects on life as a whirling disc of colors and light. Very well described. Pretty and ugly. Light and dark. Happy and sad. It is all here. The sad career man... midlife crisis for a pretty girl and never really understands why. The beautiful woman who never feels pretty, really, thanks to her hyper-critical narcisistic parents. The lovely young woman angry at the world, pierced out and hair-dyed to freakishness, determined to rid all of us of those evil greedy capatilist companies. The young man, disconnected to everything but a joint, who is jerked into consciousness by the screwed up world his family has created. The serial adulterers; the bird-dogging-heart-stealing mistress. The denials that we make about how are hearts flee to other places long before our genitals... and we are too stupid to actually stop it [and yes... we CAN stop this nonsense with things called AWARENESS and CHOICE]. Evans has a handle on who we are, and it is sad. Read this and do not become it, for we are not mere characters and our own endings may be less than bittersweet."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This is the first book by Nicholas Evans I have read. While the book starts strong, it falters badly as the story goes on. The character of Abbie, the daughter, is the least believable. The author does not show WHY Abbie takes up with Rolf (the ecoterrorist), remains with him, why she does not just leave him, and why she telephones him after she finally does leave. Abbie is a wealthy, educated woman, it is unbelievable that she would stay with Rolf. Evans also does not show in any way HOW Rolf found out where Abbie was; writing \\"we'll never know how he found her\\" is not satisfactory - deux ex machina works in Greek tragedies, not in contemporary novels. This novel is so interesting at the beginning - I really wanted to know about these characters and hear their stories. It is sad that the author seems to have lost interest and could not be bothered to finish the book with the level of writing the first part of the book shows."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"To keep you turning the pages, but what I liked the most about this book, and the author in particular, is that his characters are so well developed. Even when the story line strays he makes you follow because you've become so attached to the characters by the time it takes a wrong turn that you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This is my first Nicholas Evans book. I will soon be going to buy the Smoke Jumper. I found this book to be a fantastic read. Evans does a great job of illustrating the complexity of life, love and relationships. Would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"A year and a half later I am still thinking of this book. It made me think about where my life was going, where my family would be in 10 years depending on the choices we are making now. It helped me understand how people sometimes end up in the terrible situations they are in. I would say this was my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I generally base my reviews upon whether or not I would pass the book on for my 74-year-old mother to read when I'm done. I'm up in the air on this one. While the story is interesting enough it seems like it took me forever to finish this book. It drones on and on takes a while to pick up, which it does the last quarter of the book. The characters are all kind of pathetic and unrealistic. I find Abbie's behavior completely unbelievable...no daugher of priviledge would let the situation get as out of hand as she does. We never hear what happens to Sarah's parents who play a somewhat prominent role during the first half of the book. I don't know...this book left me feeling kind of blah. My advice is to read it if someone gives it to you or you can pick it up at the library but don't waste your hard-earned money on it."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Of the 4 of Evans' books, this is the most disappointing - it lacks the power of his first book, Horse Whisperer and the intensity of The Loop. The premise is promising but then lapses into the story of Abbie's parents, Ben and Sarah's divorce, which is written in mind numbing detail. The book could be half the number of pages were we not subjected to such distracting detail."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I absolutely loved this book! What a wonderful story of love, betrayal, a child gone wrong, and family relationships. The characters and the setting seemed so real. I just felt so much a part of the happenings that I hated to finish, because then I would have to leave this \\"world\\" created by the author's words. I will be sure to recommend this book to all of my fellow readers."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I thought this book was truly awful. I read the first chapter and then put it down for many months, finding it dull. I later decided to finish it. I found it lacking any creativity or much relevance. Start with a body then tell the ho-hum story of how it got there. No suspense, not particularly interesting characters, and a really dull tragedy. Teen girl gets mixed up with dangerous ecoterrorist guy and winds up dead. It didn't need a book, but I guess when you're a bestselling author you don't need to come up with good stories or themes anymore. Watch any episode of Bones for a better take on this formula and save yourself a lot of hours."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Divide is the fourth book by Nicholas Evans. While Divide is superbly written it lacks the poetic rythms of Horse Whisperer, the intensity of the Loop and the power of Smoke Jumper.Abbie Cooper, a young woman from an affluent family is sought for murder. When she unexpectedly and tragically turns up dead the reader is thrown into an emotional spiral downward. What could have caused a woman with so much potential to stray to society's fringe? And who would want her dead? The hidden fractures of Abbies family are laid bare for the reader. It isn't a pretty sight.Evans always supplies the reader with vivid characters and straightforward plots. He does so in Divide.I do believe that Divide is Evans weakest novel yet, but well worth reading and certainly a lot better than some of the other slop that is out there."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I have to say Nicholas did it again. I could not put this book down. It was very good, sad, exciding & rejoycful. I't is must read."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I never got around to reading \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" because I saw the movie first. If I read a novel before seeing the movie, that's okay. But I don't go the other way once I know the story. Therefore, I can't compare \\"The Divide\\" with other novels by Nicholas Evans. When I read on this book's jacket where he'd written \\"The Horse Whisperer\\", I decided right away to read his latest novel. I purchased the book one day, started reading it the next and spent the whole day with my nose stuck in this book. I simply couldn't put it down. And at the end, I had my box of Kleenex close by, which was a good thing. The IMAGINATION of this author is absolutely thrilling. What started out in the beginning or, so I thought, to be a murder mystery with a flair for romance, took a sudden turn in plot. And the writer did this with such ease that I immediately knew the guy was immensely talented. There was something else about him though, and I kept asking myself \\"What\\"? After I'd finished reading the last chapter, and drying my eyes, I realized exactly what it was. He has heart and it's warm and good and sad and it shows in his writing. And it makes a reader such as me wonder why that is.But, no matter, it's a wonderful story with a truly great plot. And if the reader doesn't connect with the characters in this book, then I'd have to say they couldn't connect with anyone...period. Ben and Eve Cooper have their problems, but you gotta love them both.So, why did I not give this book a five-star rating? I almost did and probably wanted to and maybe should have. I think perhaps it was because there were a few places where Evans veered off into a little too much description about places and things. I didn't care about that as much as I wanted to keep the story going about what happens next. Do I highly recommend this book? YOU BET, I DO. Good going, Nicholas Evans."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"No characters that I liked. Nothing happy happened. And I came away depressed and feeling like I wasted my money."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Straight up Nicholas Evans has always been one of my favorites...he is a great writer with compelling stories. With his latest novel, \\"The Divide\\", I can safely say that Mr. Evans has in fact, \\"jumped the shark\\". Why he would allow this one to be published defies logic. I'm sorry I have to write a review.It stinks. The story is a worn out account of a middle aged man having a mid life crisis. He meets a woman while on vacation with his family, falls in love with her, and then decides to leave his family for the other woman. The back story is more compelling and is about the brain washing of his daughter by a charismatic man who draws her into his underworld life of eco-terrorism. Bad things happen, drama ensues, families are damaged and the guilt flies. The novel would serve better as a screen-play. Evan's should have skipped the novel and gone straight to Hollywood with a treatment for the film. This book has no literary standing alongside his magnificent \\"The Horse Whisper\\".The \\"Divide\\" itself is a vacation ranch the family would visit each summer in Montana, near the continental divide. But the divide also stands for other divisions in life...parents and children, husband and wife, the difference between right and wrong etc. Evan's is no great philosopher and should therefore stick to his strong suit...big descriptions of landscape and the poetic use of language to bring human relationships into context with the natural environment. He does manage a scarce few passages of his signature prose but they are far between.Evan's description of the daughter's slide into eco-terrorism is the most compelling part of the story - but also seems stereo typical. I doubt he had practical experience with actual eco-terrorists and therefore I conclude his research must be second hand. Nevertheless when the drama begins to unfold - about halfway through the book - his cloak and dagger descriptions of life on the lamb for an eco-terrorist is reminiscent of a Robert Ludlum which should provide you with sufficient energy to finish...if you make it that far. Two stars max."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I ordered 9 books for my book club at the last minute. They arrived very promptly and in great condition. Appreciated the service - plus, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I purchased this book to take with me on a trip across the county and had it not been for the fact that I was doing quite a bit of air traveling and had nothing else to read, I probably would have given up on this book after about 200 pages.It's not that it's necessarily a bad book; it's just that there seems to be a whole lot of nothing happening throughout most of the book. I really had little interest in any of the characters and found that for the most part I didn't like any of them either. I found Sarah and Abbie annoying and Ben despicable. There was absolutely nothing interesting about Josh until the end of the book and by then it was too little, too late for me.There was also some weird phrasing in the book that I found quite laughable. For example when Rolf tells Abbie \\"You were concussed.\\" Who speaks that way? I realize that the author is British, but I found several instances when his American characters were using terms and phrases that were more British sounding than American and it detracted from the realism.This was my first time reading this author's work. I'm not sure I'm up for anymore."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nicholas Evans is an accomplished and usually good writer. Evans has the gift of capturing in prose the wonder and beauty of the landscape (mostly Western USA). Yet in \`The Divide', he brings more life to his description of the outdoors than he does to his principal characters.This is a novel about the Cooper family, an upper-middle class dysfunctional family; with two self-absorbed teenage kids, one of whom is lost in a tragic death. The sensitive, but wimpy, father and his cold, perfunctory wife (who feels that \`sex more than once a month is a bit too much' ) are characters who always seem an arms length away from being engaging. The slightly overwritten relationships Evans constructs are either dysfunctional or distressing. The qualities of \`intricacy of plot' and \`depth of characterization' that defined his bestseller \`The Horse Whisperer' (1995) and \`incise relationships' and \`insightful social commentary' that were found in his engaging novel \`Smoke Jumper' are not to be found in \`The Divide'.If you are looking for a gripping, socially engaging story, where the characters are well developed and the storyline direct and purposeful, you will not find it in this whippy novel.Nonetheless, for Evans's loyal fans this story will be enough. For you others, you will want more than what Evans has delivered in 'The Divide'. Conditionally Recommended."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"About two thirds of the way through I realized that no matter how this ended there couldn't possibly be anything uplifting about this story. Broken marriage, betrayal, child (albeit young adult) run amuk, and on and on and throw in ranch lands taken over by gas interests. Not that all this isn't happening today but this particular book was just too depressing.Now that I think about it Nicholas Evans has a formula going for him and he sticks to it in all his books, just changing the characters. I finally gave up and went on to something more entertaining."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I'm not sure this is even worth one star...i would agree with whoever said negative four stars. I absolutely hated this book. Atthe beginning i thought it would be a good love story and mystery rolled up together but the further i got into it, the more i hated it. It is slow and the characters are crazy, i do not like reading about a man basically raping his \\"girlfriend.\\" I almost quit reading it several times and the absolute ONLY reason i finshed it was to find out what happened to the sweet cowboy Ty at the end. This book was depressing and every time i put it down i was mad. This is the only Evans book i have ever read and will probably be the last."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"What seems to start out as a mystery about the discovery of a young woman frozen in ice in a brook in a remote part of Montana quickly becomes a story about relationships.The Divide is a place. A guest ranch. A very private guest ranch in Montana. As Nicholas Evans tells you, \\"It was the place where it all began. Or began to end.\\"The Cooper family had been coming there for their summer vacation for years. Sarah and Benjamin and their children Abbie and Josh. It was the place where Abbie fell in love with the State of Montana and rather than go to college at Harvard or Wellesly, she opted instead to attend the University of Montana. It was where Abbie found her cowboy, Ty, Josh found Katie Bradstock and also the place where Ben found Eve which started the unraveling of his marriage.The girl in the ice is Abbie and how she died in that fashion and in that place becomes the focus of the story for the rest of the book. And what a story it is.Drawn into the environmental activisim of UM, Abbie's exploits take on an escalating series of events until tragedy strikes and she becomes wanted for murder.Evans is a master at relationships and the many ways in which they can disintegrate. He finds fertile ground in the story of the Cooper family and he handles it beautifully. A good book to read while the fire burns on a winter night."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I listened to this book on tape in the car and from the opening chapter it was so riveting I looked forward to traffic jams so I could continue listening. I do wish the author had followed up on the skiers who found Abbie's body (no spoiler here, we get this at the first chapter and on the book cover), as well on as the beautiful young Italian architect Sarah met in Venice. That would have been such sweet revenge over husband Ben for dumping her for a younger woman during his ridiculous and predictable mid--life crisis, but the author is a man and would not let Sarah get the upper hand in the end. Ben and Eve get off way too easily in this story.The first chapter describing the skiing father and son was breathtaking.i was guessing constantly as to the culprit in Abbie's death. Suffice it to say I did not predict the ending.I am now searching out other works by this author."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"As an author who has written his fair share of emotional journeys, I have to say that I liked this quiet and unassuming novel that shows the evolution of a broken family and how life can go on, even after a terrible tragedy. Nicholas Evans forges a beautiful novel that can both break our hearts and feed our hopes."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed listening to this audio CD. I have been a fan of Nicholas Evans since he wrote The Horse Whisperer (as I am sure many of you are). I have enjoyed his beautiful descriptions of Montana and the stories he writes are engaging. This story, The Divide, is no different. It involves an annual vacation to a dude ranch called The Divide in Montana. Many happy vacations occur there for the family, but the last one is different....... The story is told from each family member's point of view. I found this very interesting because each family member shows their flaws and insecurities. This book was extremely well written and the narration of the audio CD kept me rivited."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The book (used) arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. Nothing to quibble about there. The fact that it seemed a bit derivative of his earlier The Horse Whisperer is hardly Amazon's fault. Still, I had to read it for my book group, so I did. Has anyone else noticed that the only really strong men in his book are from Montana or Wyoming? It might be interesting to read his new one, since I assume all characters are Brits."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"But nothing ever caught my interest. I felt NOTHING for the characters which can sometimes help to carry a dull plot but Evans gave me primarily one-dimensional self-involved bores. The writing was plodding and tiresome. Senseless descriptions galore. I had to force myself to finish reading it and for the first time, in self defense, I \\"skimmed\\" to find the parts that actually carried the story line so I could at last be done with it. I'll never trust professonal reviews on book covers again. I gave it at least one star for the cover art."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I agree with reader, Superstar, in that the daughter would nothave let the situation get so out of hand. Beyond that, however,I completely did not buy the characters Ty and Josh coveringup their involvement because they really had not committed acrime and the whereabouts of Abbie could have been solved muchsooner."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I read The Horse Whisperer a while back and found it an absorbing and masterly piece of storytelling. Unfortunately The Divide is not in the same ballpark.The main thing absent is a compelling plot. It starts with two skiers - a man and his son - finding a body. The rest of the book goes back in time to explain how the body came to be there. The problem is that there is not enough of a story and it becomes largely a family drama which is not dramatic enough, with characters which lack depth so that you don't really care about them.Strangely too, the narrator is too visible. For example, you tend to see the Evans family on holiday during descriptions such as that of a whale-watching trip or staying at a hotel where lots of the guests are having cosmetic surgery.I feel for authors who written a huge success and then have to follow it up. Not only do you have to follow it up, but editors seem unwilling to challenge you on including lots of unnecessary detail and asides to the reader which slow the pace and lessen the power.I have heard that Evans was on form with The Loop and will give that a go.And maybe he'll write a great book about what became of the two skiers who found the body at the start of The Divide."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"AFTER THE FIRST TWENTY PAGES OR SO, I THOUGHT YAHOO, THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.YYYEEE-OW!!!

The ending was slightly dissappointing but I couldn't have plotted it better myself. Use of words and descriptions are truly magnificent!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"GREAT book! On the recommendation of a friend I went into this reading experience with absolutely no idea what the book was about and was blown away by this thought provoking, well written novel. I generally stick to non-fiction and more hard edged detective/crime novels so this was an unexpected treat.It begins with a father and son out snow skiing, lots of imagery involving snow covered landscapes and narrative commentary on their relationship - around page three or four I'm thinking that at 400-odd pages this may not be the book for me... then they find a young woman's body encased in ice and the story kicks into gear. As the story of who the woman was begins to unfold the plot jumps back in time a few years and then comes forward, along the way unraveling the unlikely mystery that we've stumbled into.The mystery is built around the story of how a family of four (father, mother, and their teenaged children) begins to fall apart as a result of various decisions made by all involved and the unintended consequences that each member's personal choices has on the others. At times their behavior is heart wrenching, other times infuriating, still other times bewildering and yet it rarely comes across as sappy or overly sentimental (in the broader sense of the story). In the process it gives a well rounded story from multiple points of view with each of the major characters becoming very real and fully dimensional so that no one is completely bad or good, right or wrong, they are all just people making mistakes and having to deal with it.For me, the one false note in the story was the way that many of the secondary characters were portrayed in a broad stereotypical, almost caricature fashion. The environmental hippie types, the greedy, soulless corporate types, the humorless FBI agents, the simple, down-home country folk, all seem pretty much standard issue. Granted many of them only make brief appearances and are often described from one of the major character's point of view but it still came across as a bit too easy at times.It's a mystery, a good one, but it also has to do with the interactions of people in general and family in particular. It will have you thinking about it for days after you've finished.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a taste for smart, well written general or literary fiction. There is some sexual content, strong language and reference to drug use that might offend very sensitive readers."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This book was entertaing and kept my interest. The characters were real and believeable. Evans can be relied on to tell a meaningful story."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I checked out the audio edition of The Divide by Nicholas Evans for a car trip from Texas to South Carolina. The book was 14 hours long, and since we couldn't listen all the way, we had not finished by the time we arrived. My wife and I continued to listen after we arrived, some the first night and the rest the next morning. We talked about the book and weren't sure what pulled us in so. But we agreed we had to know how the story ended. Unlike the books we normally read, there was not an appealing main character. Instead, there were many interesting characters, most of whom grew and changed during the story. I think what kept me listening was the way the author described the characters and the settings. I could see them in my mind. The descriptions were unique, not the clich&eacute;s some authors use.The book begins near the end of the story, and then backs up and backs up more. It is not until the twelfth and final disc that the book catches up with its beginning.The lives of Ben and Sarah Cooper and their son, Jeff, are changed forever when they learn their college-aged daughter, Abbie, is wanted for murder after an ecoterrorism plan turns deadly.I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"CD/Unabridged/literature: This book was really long. From the beginning, you know the ending. A body is found at the bottom of a ravine; frozen in ice. We quickly learn that she is the daughter of a well off family and a member of the ELF (Google it; it really exists). Her family is a stereotypical family of four. Her father seems like a doormat and her trust fund mother a shrew. They also have the typical burnout son. But nothing is as it seems. From the beginning, you think one thing. Then the novel flashes back the earlier years. How the parents met, a vacation on the ranch, and other key moments that that change and divide each character and relationship. By the end of the book, you see all the divides and you learn how the girl from Long Island ended up at the bottom of the ravine in Montana.As for recommending it? Well, it's literature. Listening to it can be slow. I think abridge would have been better. Scott Brick does a wonderful job with the narration and the book is well written. However, by disc 8, I wanted it to end or put me out of my misery. If you like literature, this is the book for you. I read the back summary and thought it was a mystery. While there is a ton, and I mean a ton, of red herrings in the beginning, the conclusion took too long."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I like the book fairly well. It moves along and keeps you reading. It follows the story and than goes back to pick up the details of what happened to get you where you are now in the story. A good read. I had read this authors first book, The Horse Whispher, so when I saw this book, I was curious about it. Read a review and decided to purchase it for my Kindle from Amazon. He also wrote The Brave, which I have not read yet."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nicholas Evans, in THE DIVIDE, has written another what I refer to as a cupcake book. It's a sweet and satisfying treat that does no harm if consumed infrequently. Evans is a master baker who has a genius for putting together common ingredients, giving them a little twist, and creating a lip-smacking indulgence.In The Divide the common ingredients are a successful but restless couple, teenagers at the cusp of rebellion, irritating and intrusive in-laws, and wise and consoling friends. There are bouts with recreational drugs, alcohol abuse, flirtatious behavior, and jealousy. As the story progresses, each of these ingredients rises to immense proportions as if infused with yeast on steroids. He uses environmental terrorism as his twist. Evans, an incredibly gifted writer, knows how to knead them all together into a book that titillates but falls short of the erotic label (the kiss of death for a serious author). In the end, the reader has a cupcake.This kind of book is a hot seller. There are many readers who want easy enjoyment, with a hint of naughtiness, without the necessity of applying much thought to the words they find on the pages. They spend a lot of money seeking them out. Most books of this type are gagging in their honeyed approach. However, Nicholas Evans is one of the talented storytellers who can make something special and intriguing out of commercial writing. I suspect he has his eye on creating a cash cow more than expecting to pen a literary classic.But give him credit. He still works hard on his research and generally produces a captivating theme, credible dialogue, intriguing and realistic characters, and stunning visuals. He takes common ingredients and turns them into something palatable. By doing so, he has earned an enviable label for his efforts; best-selling author.I devoured the book, enjoyed it somewhat, and it didn't take long to finish. As I now digest it, I realize that I won't need another for a while. I have the clear intent on going on a diet and will return to deMontaigne, Descartes, and Moliere for penance. I know I'll succumb to another pastry from time to time, but that doesn't mean you have to be so strict in what you eat (uh...read).Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"One of my favorite books ever is The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans.

Don't let any negative review stop you from reading this book. It is true that their are a few chapters were Evan's describes a lot and slows things down but it just gets better and better as you get to the end."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I love Nichohlas Evans' books and was looking forward to reading this one, but was a little dissapointed in it. It did draw me into the story, and kept me turning the pages, however, it was not quite the 'I can't put it down' mystery that my favorite book 'The Smoke Jumper' was. The overuse of the f#%k word was very distracting and not at all necessary to describe the moment. Overall, it is worth reading, but it is not on my list to read over and over again, like some of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"This was my first book by Nicholas Evans. I know he is an acclaimed author and have seen the \\"Horse Whisperer\\" movie. It was the blurb on the book jacket that intrigued me. After I read a few chapters I wasn't sure I wanted to read the rest. I have a daughter that has been missing for 20 years under similar circumstances, and this book really was touching me to the core. But I read on.Contrary to other reviewers opinions, I think the characters are very believeable. These tragedies do happen to families, good families. Good marriages fall apart for complex reasons. Abbie reacted to her parent's breakup in a very real way. When her world changed she became very insecure and vulnerable to causes and people that gave her a purpose, even if they were wrong. And yes, even kids from good homes and good parents are capable of making grave mistakes that change their lives forever.I liked Evan's style of writing the ending first, and then backtracking to develop the plot. We know right from the start that Abbie is dead, but we need to know how it all came to be. The story is both compelling and so very tragic. Evan's is a good writer and I plan to read more of his books. Give \\"The Divide\\" a chance. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"Nicholas Evans's new book, THE DIVIDE, may turn out to be one of my favorite books of the year. The story is that of the Cooper family --- Ben, Sarah, Abbie and Josh --- who start out as a typically happy middle class family, until a series of events tears them apart.The title has a dual meaning. In addition to being the name of the ranch where the Coopers visited for two weeks each summer, the book's title also represents the divide between men and women, which is portrayed in the unraveling of the Cooper family's marriage. The lives of their loved ones are torn apart by this separation, which in turn leads to the more devastating destruction of their daughter, Abbie.At the start of the novel, two skiers find the body of a young woman embedded in the ice of a remote mountain creek. The police work throughout the night to dig her out. She is later identified as Abbie Cooper, who was wanted by the FBI for murder and acts of eco-terrorism.The book then proceeds to tell the story of Abbie's family, beginning with Ben and Sarah, their courtship and eventual union. Ben, who has been unhappy for a long time, knows his love for Sarah is not enough to keep the marriage going and therefore announces his decision to leave the family. The \\"catalyst,\\" as Ben tells Sarah, is Eve, a lovely woman whom they had met at the Divide the last year they vacationed there. While at first Eve was sought out as a friend, she is now the enemy.Ben's wife and children react a lot more unfavorably than he had anticipated, and each handles his or her grief in slightly different ways. Sarah grows angry and resentful, while son Josh becomes distant. Abbie, who was Ben's favorite, turns her anger toward her father into something destructive and exhibits behavior that is out of control.The year of her parents' separation, Abbie begins her freshman year at a college in Montana (against their wishes) and finds her interests focused on groups that lead radical protests at major political events. But when she meets a man introduced to her as Rolf, Abbie's life takes an even more dangerous turn as she becomes involved in his treacherous attempts to bring attention to his causes, burning down buildings for the sake of his beliefs.THE DIVIDE tells two stories --- the breakdown of a marriage, and the destruction of a young girl full of promise. Abbie's story is heartbreaking and tragic, which will prompt readers to ask themselves, \\"Whose fault is this?\\" While the bulk of the novel is told in flashbacks, Evans does allow his characters to resolve their issues, giving closure to the mystery of Abbie's death, as well as resolution to Ben and Sarah's relationship.Like the authors' previous work --- THE HORSE WHISPERER, THE SMOKE JUMPER and THE LOOP --- much of the story is set in Montana, which Evans describes beautifully. In the opening pages readers can see, and feel, the setting. This continues throughout the pages and there are times where the landscape almost becomes a character as much as a place.Nicholas Evans writes emotion with extraordinary candor. Woven in the story is a stark look at what marriage means and the differences between men and women. Beyond this, Evans is a great storyteller. You will close this book wanting to talk about it. If this book doesn't pick up new fans for Evans's work, I would be greatly surprised. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org)"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I liked this book and found that it was hard to put down. Mr. Evans writes a very interesting story that kept me turning the pages but I did not feel strongly about the relationships and people. After I read Smoke Jumper a book that blew me away I was eagerly awaiting The Divide. But unfortunately it did not have the intense power that Smoke had. I did not close the book at the end saying to myself that \\"God I Loved that book\\""},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"What is it that divides a man from a woman, a parent from a child, an environmentalist from an eco-terrorist? What makes us whole and what has to give when that wholeness is shattered? Nicholas Evans plots with a poet's pen. His book is addictive; both a thriller and a tender exploration of love and family. It delves into the impossible places, where remaining true to yourself can be at odds with all other obligations. This is a bitingly contemporary tale, full of laughter and beauty, lightness and sorrow. It's definitely Evans' best yet. The characters of the Divide slowly creep up on you. They endear you, engage you, surprise you, make you giggle. Put down this book and you feel enhanced by them -they've become your friends. And it's in this context that Evans performs his magic. For the horror that emerges, emerges largely from his character's love and good will, not their hate or innate evil. In this book, reacting to injustice can poison you, and reacting to your heart can poison others, yet both instincts define us as civilized, caring beings. It isn't easy, bridging the divide: Evans has made a work of art out of it."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"The body of a young woman is found, embedded in ice, on a mountain in Montana. Her body is easily identified as that of Abbie Cooper, the daughter of a comfortably off family, who was caught up romantically with an eco terrorist who involved her in the murder of an innocent victim. Wanted by the police and hunted by the FBI, she was estranged from her family and lived, in a similar situation as Patty Hearst, on the streets in squats, in filth and poverty, but still in thrall to her ruthless and non caring lover. Just prior to Abbie separating from her family, they were torn apart by her father, Ben, leaving her mother, Sarah, for another woman, after twenty years of marriage. This situation drives an insurmountable wedge between father and daughter and causes Sarah to accuse Ben of being the cause of Abbie's death, whether it was accidental or murder. It's a good read which skips backwards and forwards between time zones and delves deeply into the inner secrets of a family in trouble."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"You know how so many authors write a fantastic first novel but seem to loose something along the way? How subsequent books never quite live up to that first one? I'm happy to say, this is not the case with Evans. I'll be honest.... I've never read the HORSE WHISPERER. I own it and have seen the movie several times, but after making many promises (to myself) to read it, for one reason or another, I just haven't gotten around to it (I did start it a long time ago & have read bits & pieces to compare it to the movie - I do know that the book has an entirely different ending!).Even tho I've never read HORSE WHISPERER cover to cover, I do know that Nicholas Evans is a fantastic author & THE HORSE WHISPERER is considered by most to be his best piece of work. I did read his last novel, SMOKE JUMPER (HC release 2001). I loved that book, thought it was extremely well written and looked forward to reading future novels from this author. Once I heard a release date was set for THE DIVIDE, I added it to my Wishlist & counted down the days to its release. SMOKE JUMPER is ranked among my favorite novels and after reading it, Evans became one of my favorite authors. I'm happy to say, THE DIVIDE did not disappoint me & has solidified Evans' place among my favorite authors.When I first read the summary of this book, I wasn't entirely sure it was going to be my \\"cup of tea.\\" Even after I started reading the first chapter or so - it seemed like it was very slow going, and I had a feeling I would be putting it away in order to read another book. Thankfully, I stuck it out, and once the story got going, I found it very hard to put it down.Evans devotes a lot of time & attention to each of the main character's backgrounds, and by the time I finished reading it, I felt as if I personally knew each one of them. The book was an extremely emotional read, which builds with each chapter and ends on a very powerful note. I don't think any other (fictional) book I've ever read left me with the same types of feeling and emotion I had once I finished this book. Having raised my own teenage daughter & a younger son, I could easily identify with Benjamin & Sarah in so many ways. Mistakes are made, regrets are had, and the extremes they go to protect their children will leave many parents asking themselves what they might do if found in a similar situation. The many emotions and roller coaster rides that parents experience are explored in great detail, but what is evident in every chapter, on every page is the love they share for their children, and even at the worst of times, each other.This is definitely not considered a \\"lightweight\\" read, and will possibly exhaust some readers emotionally. This could have been the headline story taken from the front page of any current US newspaper. I think it's entirely worth the journey however, and I'm so grateful that Evans decided to tell a story like this. If I have any complaints about the book, it would be that Sarah's \\"happily ever after\\" seemed a bit forced and a little unbelievable. Other than that, I thought the story was very powerful and heartfelt, uplifting and sad, and once I was done, I felt like I had taken a journey that no parent ever wants to travel through, but one that they should definitely be aware of.I highly recommend this book - to fans of Evans and parents everywhere. The subject matter should not be taken lightly, and will give many readers pause for thought, however, I don't think anyone will regret their time spent at THE DIVIDE, and will close the book after reading the final chapter, a little bit wiser and a little more observant. They may even want to give their kids a hug and remind them of how much they are loved.Looking forward to the next book from Nicholas Evans - I just hope we don't have to wait four more years! If his next book is anywhere near as good as THE DIVIDE, however, it will definitely have been worth the wait!"},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"THE DIVIDE by Nicholas EvansOctober 15, 2005Amazon Rating: 5/5 starsThis is my first book by Nicholas Evans, whose most famous novel is THE HORSE WHISPERER, and I can definitely say that I am now a fan. THE DIVIDE is the story of a family torn apart because of a broken marriage, which in turn triggers the downfall of one of its members.The book opens in the snow covered mountains of Montana, where two skiers find the body of a young woman. It is apparent she had been dead for a while now. It is later discovered that this woman was the missing fugitive wanted by the FBI, Abbie Cooper. The novel then proceeds with the story of the Coopers - the marriage of Sarah and Ben Cooper, their two children, and the dissatisfaction that Ben felt for his relationship with Sarah. Told in great detail, THE DIVIDE is a riveting story of a family torn in two, told in flashbacks, starting from the early sixties and ending in contemporary times.Nicholas Evans writes his story with great care, and does a wonderful job in creating a vivid picture in the minds of the reader, drawing three-dimensional characters and describing the setting with such mastery so as to make the reader feel they are there with the characters. I found he is an excellent storyteller, and I could not put this book down, as I wanted to know why Abbie went down that road in life as she chose to do. A girl with a promising future, Abbie is deeply affected by her parents' breakup. While one of the main story lines follows Sarah and Ben's relationship and subsequent divorce, the other main plot is the story of Abbie, and how she finds herself caught up in the world of a wanted Eco-terrorist, a life that ended in tragedy.I highly recommend THE DIVIDE as it is a book that is hard to put down. One of my favorites so far in 2005."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I just finished reading the THE DIVIDE a few days ago. I loved it.I don't think that Abbie was the heartless and radical environmentalist at heart that Rolf. After he saved her in Seattle, when the WTO protests were happening, I feel that he found out her background and swooned in. I know it was Abbie's choice to stay with and plot the burning down of McGaugin's home, but I think she was sorry for causing the accidental shooting of the McGaugin Jr.I wish the author had let us know exactly who Rolf was and where he came from and how he decided to be so radical.I felt bad that Abbie wasn't able to get away from Rolf. Though thinking about it, he left her many times alone for weeks, I guess it never occured to her to just leave him and turn herself in."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"\\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\" Had Tolstoy not penned this opening line, Nick Evans certainly could've used it for his newest novel, The Divide, the story of a family faced by a crisis of devastating change. A family in crisis is nothing new; after all, a happy family is an oxymoron and the term dysfunctional family is redundant. What is unique is when a writer causes you to empathize with characters who are in conflict with each other. And this is where Evans shines, he causes the reader to empathize with each character-and this is no small storytelling accomplishment given that one of the central narratives of the novel follows the divorce of Ben and Sarah. In one chapter, you side with Sarah and view Ben as a lout. In the next chapter, you can't help but empathize with Ben. To write this novel, Evans must've reached deep within because it's quite obvious that he has written from the heart. There is immediacy, compassion, and authenticity etched into The Divide that surpasses his previous well-written novels.While the The Divide contains plenty of tension and each character faces crisis, there is no villain, at least not in human guise. (Granted, Rolf isn't the kind of guy you'd delight in seeing your daughter date, but he's wrestling his own demons.) Fear is the villain, fear of change, fear of the unknown. Initially Ben (the husband/father) fears proceeding down the path that he knows, deep inside, he will inevitably follow and inextricably change his relationship to his family. He fears being unliked. Sarah (the wife/mother) fears a husbandless future and the unknown changes that will come with having to redefine herself. But beneath the surface in this story of a family facing change runs the whisper of an insidious fear, the tentacles of which ensnare an entire nation. And here is where Evans proves his brilliance; he doesn't whack his reader over the head with a didactic message. But I will. The crisis that confronts Abbie (daughter/sister) would prove serious in any political climate, but prior to 9/11 her misdeeds would more than likely have been forgivable. Following 9/11 however, Abbie finds herself on a path from which there is no turning back because of the fear that has pierced the heart of America. While the tremendous loss faced by the Cooper family is literal, I believe Evans asks his readers to consider this: What losses do American families face due to the malignant fear that we've allowed ourselves to be governed by?But Evans provides a glimmer of hope. Like the Cooper family, America can face its fears and proceed forward. George Herbert (in his wonderful novel Dune) wrote, \\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\\"Each member of the Cooper family eventually faces his or her fear and in doing so, acknowledges the inevitable nature of change. Whether one wants it or not, change happens. The only choice we're given when it comes to change is how we respond. Through his characters, Evans shows us that we can face change with courage and dignity instead of cowering before it in fear."},{"Title":"The Divide","review":"I just finished this book this morning.

Chapter contents: (1) \\"Introduction to First Edition\\" by Ali Rahnema (\`Certain Attributes of Islamic Revivalists'); (2) \\"Sayyid Jamal al-Din \`Al-Afghani'\\" by Nikki Keddie (Jamal's biography and influence); (3) \\"Muhammad Abduh: Pioneer of Islamic Reform\\" by Yvonne Haddad ( Abduh's analysis of the problem, his reform project, Quranic exegesis, politics); (4) \\"Khomeini's Search for Perfection\\" by Baqer Moin (Kho's background, interest in politics & as the Ruler); (5) \\"Mawdudi and the Jama'at-I Islami\\" by Vali Reza Nasr (Mawdudi's education, ideology, structure of the Jamaat); (6) \\"Hasan al-Banna\\" by David Commins; (7) Sayyid Qutb: The Political Vision\\" by Charles Tripp (the political vision from Al'adalah al-Ijtima'iyyah fi al-Islam to Ma'alim fi al-Tariq); (8) \\"Musa al-Sadr\\" by Augustus Norton; (9) \\"Ali Shariati\\" by Ali Rahnema; and (10) \\"Muhammad Baqer as-Sadr\\" (theology and Islamic banking theories) by Chibli Mallat. The \`new introduction' expands the book by about 10%. The chapter titles pretty well inform you what this book is about. This book was updated to include the musings as to why Osama bin Laden undertook his attack upon New York City, and how Samuel Huntington would view bin Laden as part of the \`clash of civilizations'. The editor helps a reader understand how the power of the Muslim World began to wane after the Christian re-conquest of Spain, followed by the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and how the Christian Right of the U.S. began their anti-Islam rhetoric after 9/11 - and briefly discusses their influence upon Pres. Bush's invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. I found this book to have nice, tight, scholarly writings - not the verbose fluffy stuff that appeared in so many of the spur-of-the-moment books following 9/11. This book's contributors do provide some nice, harsh critique of the short-comings of those that they are analyzing - this work is not a fawning, apologetic look at these Islamist \`Strong Horses'. A follow-up book here is \\"The Closing of the Muslim Mind\\" by Robert Reilly."},{"Title":"Pioneers of Islamic Revival: Second Edition","review":"The first edition of this book is invaluable for its collection of intellectual biographies of figures like Khomeini, Shariati, and Afghani. At long last, the editor has updated the book, and I pleased to say that he maintained the high quality of the volume."},{"Title":"Little Oxford Thesaurus","review":"Always nice to have a compact thesaurus to help you when you can't find a word!"},{"Title":"The Ardernes & their garden: A family chronicle","review":"Arderne Tredgold's account of the Arderne family in the Cape Coloney at the start of the 1800's is a valuable insight into colonial life in the young South Africa. A well written book which is a must for any member of the Arderne family and invaluable to any students of South African or British colonial history. Tredgold's love of her subject is evident and she manages to pass this enthusiasm on to the reader. The book also contains several historical photographs which offer the reader a glimpse into everyday life at the beginning of the 19th century. A well researched book which makes for good reading."},{"Title":"The Ardernes & their garden: A family chronicle","review":"I agree thoroughly with Cliff's review. This is invaluable if you are at all interested in the history of the Arderne family in South Africa. It provides a very interesting insight into the intimacies of family life in the early years and the family tree at the back of the book is a value in itself. Makes me want to visit all the properties mentioned - just a shame some have gone for good."},{"Title":"On Fulcrum's Wings","review":"I found this book a compelling read. It is more a tale of a journey of a man in modern war than a story of the Gulf War. The Mig-29 Fulcrum provides an excellent symbol of a modern-day Trojan Horse, and the medium for which it is told is compelling, detailed, and intriguing. This novel is a real page-turner..."},{"Title":"On Fulcrum's Wings","review":"I loved On Fulcrums Wings, I couldn't put it down. This book changed my life and the way I view war and the military. It was so good to be able read a novel that made you feel like you were actually there. A pilot behind an incredible machine at the brink of war. What an amazing dipiction of tactical operation. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the final outcome. I would recommend the book to anyone who wants a better understanding of what goes on for the soldier and all that is involved in war. Finally, I can only say, how much longer do we have to wait for a second book. Lets hope Mr. Mark Werkema is hard at work creating just that."},{"Title":"On Fulcrum's Wings","review":"As an Air Force Fighter Pilot, I thought I might be in for another dull and inaccurate depiction of real tactical operations. How wrong I was! Mr. Werkema has spun an outstanding web of military Operations that is worthy of every page it was written upon. I would highly recommend his book to anyone interested in military operations in the new complex world or warfare."},{"Title":"On Fulcrum's Wings","review":"In this day and age of war and terrorism, I found this book to be especially thrilling. It really made me take a look at how truly dangerous and complex military operations are. After reading &quot;On Fulcrum's Wings&quot;, I have a renewed appreciation for those who defend our country.I highly recommend this book. Although this book is written from a male point of view, I believe that women, too, will find it fascinating."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I found the first few chapters to be the most valuable ones, providing overviews of general topics. In particular the chapter on relational database design would be good for someone who's a new or intermediate database designer.After the first few overview or theoretical chapters, though -- once you \\"dive into the code\\" -- things start to unravel pretty quickly. The choice of topics covered via code examples seems random and arbitrary. It's possible that perusing the code included on the CD would be of value. That might be true if the code wer not riddled with typos and errors. As for the text itself, once you get into the code sections, you can almost count on a typo or more per page. I even found errors in the entity relationship diagrams. As another reader pointed out, discovering the errors may serve as a debugging exercise, but that's not why you buy a book like this. And if you just want to peruse code, there is plenty of open source stuff out there for free.As a web developer with some familiarity with MySQL and PHP (and extensive programming experience in other areas) I found this book to be incomplete and spotty as a guide to developing PHP/MySQL applications. You could do worse, but you could do a whole lot better.I get the feeling that they ran out of time with this one, and rushed to finish it up. It's too bad that the second half of the book isn't as good as the first half."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Within the first couple of chapters, I noticed that they really need to use spell check! Typos in their own book scared me because Typos are something that is not accepted when coding. Seemed they used the good vs bad relationships and normalization for MySQL, almost same topics as used in the O'Reilly's MySQL/msql book.It was simple to understand though. Beginners should look for other books instead of this!"},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"This book is just great to quickly get a grip of simple to intermediate applications using mySQL and the powerful &quot;web language&quot; PHP. This book is not for beginners in web development or programming, though. If you are a web programmer that really need serious in-depth knowledge about PHP og mySQL, this book is not for you either."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Making the transition from flat HTML to PHP/Mysql, this COULD'VE been a great book. However, because of the numerous errors contained in the application scripts, none of them see to work out of the box, and it ends up being more confusing for the novice. I suppose it is good debugging training, but it's a rough way to learn! If anyone ever comes up with an &quot;Errata&quot; site or updated scripts, please let me know. The editor/proofreader should be out of a job. Meanwhile, I'm out $30!!"},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I have read many good books on this subject and this is the best one that I have found for examples of applications. This book includes a CD with examples of the projects described in the book. Scripts are easy to install and modify and good starting point for better projects."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"The chapters are easy to follow with real examples of how aspects of the languages work. Right away, the authors show you how to write a guest book, ending with how to write a shopping cart. I highly recommend this book to anyone with prior programming experience that wants to learn a new language."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"It seemed as though this book was meant for people that already have a understanding of the foundation of PHP. Basic programming skills are definitely required. The introduction chapter dives you right into some PHP script that I copied verbatim and got an error result.

A lot better than many of the others on the market.In particular I like the way that the topics follow on and are clearly more than just a collestion of essays (which I have found the Wrox books can have a tendency to be).Tom"},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I would like to state that this book is quite good.I've used it quite extensively. It was exactly what I needed.I've read some of the other reviews.No, if you never programmed before, then this may not be thebook for you. Though, if you understand the basics ofprogramming. You should be able to understand it.If you're already an expert at MYSQL &amp; PHP - This is not thebook for you either. (And, why would you buy it then?)This is simply a good book to learn MYSQL &amp; PHP in web applications.This Book was written fairly well. Easy to understand. Healso points out the problems that may arise up when developingweb pages. I recommend this book to anybody who:Knows programming fundamentals, and wants to develop applications in PHP &amp; MYSQL.I give it 4 stars. Because I think there's room for a little improvement."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Being a Civil Engineer by training, I needed a book that quickly put me into PHP/MySQL with the least possible hassle and maximum efficiency. This book did it! I started just reading through without highlight anything (to be able to return it if not convinced), but liked it much that by Chapter 2, I put my name on the book.I would certainly recommend it to people with little or some programming experience that are more comfortable with a procedural approach. Starting from zero knowledge of PHP, I read the book in about three weeks and got the shopping cart operating in about five, great for someone like me doing this as a hobby.Areas where this book can be improved is its managment and explanations regarding Regular Expressions. Also, the section in the Appendix that deals with intalling Apache web server needs improvement. Jay, you need to walk the reader step by step (as you do in the body of the book) through the coldness of Apache. Is kind'a scary to have a DOS window in Windows with Apache sitting right there with no clue of what's next! I look forward to Jay's 2nd edition of this book to see this corrected.Good job Jay!"},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"If you want to take some code off of a CD and get something up and running in a short period of time, this book is ok, but if that's your purpose you'll find more useful code on the web.If you're looking to learn PHP and MySQL by doing something useful and writing code and such, this isn't the book for you. 85% of the code is written for you in this book, and included on the CD. While you would think this would leave room in the book for thorough coverage of other things, that just isn't the case.The first 7 chapters do little more than introduce a user to MySQL and PHP, and the NINE APPENDICES in back do little more than that. The projects in between are worthy projects for novice PHP programmers I suppose, but I don't imagine you learn much when you're not really writing any of the code! It's all done for you, leaving you to write a few menial blocks that do nothing but call the files that are already written to use those functions - which is nearly useless if you want to learn PHP."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I bought this book with the intention of learning PHP. I went into it with a some knowledge of programming, no knowledge of SQL, and a strong background in logic.I very quickly discovered that, rather than a learning guide, what I purchased was the source code for several applications with vague descriptions of how data was being handled.In fairness, I do find what i am looking for about 10% of the time. The other 90% I am either checking the web for source, discussions, or tutorals, or I am using the PHP manual and playing hit and miss.It is my experience that anything this book can offer is freely available from the Web. And that the Web offerings are usually better documented.If you are a beginner, look elsewhere. This book will likely leave you dumbfounded.If you are experienced, look elsewhere. This book will likely bore you to tears."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Personally i have some experience on perl/cgi programming, thus this book provide me a new perspective to web designing using a different programming approach thru PHP. if u are at the cross junction in deciding whether to learn perl or php, i will personally suggest perl 1st and later on, on php. but mysql is a must is u want to create a database website. this book is easy to undestand but while i was reading from page 1 to 80 i realise there are some programming syntax that are misleading, to list a few, signed and unsigned integer are interpreted wrongly, so are GET and POST interpreted as action in HTML form Tag. just be alert while reading this book.But on a whole i give this book a 4 because it gives u 7 practical useful web application ranging from guestbook, survey, catalog, shopping cart etc. this book provides a good readup for MySQL on chapter 1 whether u are using perl or php. buy this book if u want to learn php for web database implentation. it is straight to the point. and if u want to know more indept on MySQL u can trust on paul dubois's MySQL. i gave that full thumbs up."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"This book is very good for &quot;not too novice&quot; who would like to learn PHP &amp; MySQL simultaneously. It is a nice book. If you would like to learn PHP and MySQL fastly, then this book is for you. If you buy this book, don't forget to buy another book which covers more about basic programming in PHP (you don't get it in this book)."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"The authors provide a good coverage of using PHP and MySQL. They guide the reader through the elements of the language and using PHP and MySQL together well. I also found the summary of MySQL functions and the PHP function reference in the appendix to be helpful. Several example application systems are provided that are very relevant to current practical web database system applications, this is a big plus. Another nice feature of the examples is a database schema is included for each application -- nice touch!... but the text is somewhat awkward, I fault the publisher. My first comment is that the code samples and snippets in the text are TOO LARGE, the font appears to be about 2 sizes larger than the body text. Also, the headings and subheadings in each chapter are hard to distinguish, maybe this is an M&amp;T Books standard. I don't mean to be picky but I had a hard time reading the text and the large font probably added 80 pages to the book.

What a mistake!When I first opened it up I was exited by the project management example in chapter 17. I told my wife I must have it! After I got home and started reading through it I decided to load the sample data into the my htdocs directory in my local Apache install. The nightmare never ended in getting the code to work. And this wasn't because I didn't set up the user accounts in MySQL! After messing around with it all weekend I decided to pay my fried a visit who is an expert web developer (builds web-enabled databases for California lobyists with millions of records). He looked at the code and found constructs that are specific to PHP5. The readme didn't say that I must install PHP5 for the examples to work. Anyway, after changing the code to conform to PHP4 syntax the examples still didn't work.I'm totally disappointed that I spent my hard earned dollars on this book. If the authors would be kind enough to post some code that works and is easy to follow, that would be a good step at repentance. Oh, one last thing, the authors make use of PEAR; that was a pain to install too. However, I got that working (with no instructions in the book) and the code still fails to work.Two thumbs down for this book."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"You've probably read elements of this review in other people's posts. Here's the straight dope for beginners:Start with something else. PHP FAST &amp; EASY is much better than this. I've read that and still don't know what to do with this book. I thought I was ready for it, but to be honest it's just poorly laid out.What the authors SHOULD have done was take each section and force you to write the scripts giving you step-by-step examples and explanations to each. This never happens. Instead what you do is cover all functions and the basics of programming first, AND THEN they insert elements of each important aspect of the scripts. This forces you to look at the CD and try and match up with the book. (Which is not EXACT!)I'm sure I could figure out how to write these apps given a few months worth of exploring and trial and error, so why did I buy this thing when I can do that from tutorials on the net?This book is a waste of money for those that want to learn powerful applications in a 1 - 2 - 3 step manor.

This book never seems to get to the specifics. They spend so much time introducing individuals to the topic of PHP and MySQL that they hardly ever get to specifics. When they do get to specifics they do a good job of covering what needs to be covered.This may be a result of the fact that the book was written by a number of authors. Overall it is a nice reference book to have and good if you are just beginning but not extremely valuable for experienced programmers."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"When I began reading this book I was excited because I like the way it explains things. My excitement dwindled when I attempted to install the scripts. I'm no pro when it comes to PHP or MySQL but I do have about 50 other scripts running that use them so I was surprised when I could not get a single script from the CD to work. Every one produces &quot;Fatal error: Call to undefined function:...&quot;The site that is allegedly associated with the book was of no help. Emails to both authors went without response.The errors could have to do with configuration of the server (or the php.ini file on the server) I am using to test the scripts on...that's just a guess given that some reviewers of this book seem to have had no problem.I wish I had spent the money I wasted on this book on chocolate. It would have taken less time to work off the calories than I expended trying to get these scripts to run."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I'm puzzled by the negative reviews.

And the writing was just right in terms of code hints and kinks along with clear explainations of database concepts.I'm reading the first edition, saw the second edition was out, and ordered it.I will agree, however, that there are *many* editing mistakes where they mistake terms or have errors in their tables/code.

For instance, when showing an example of a &quot;contact&quot; table, the text refers to contacts while the example shows contracts. There are missing &quot;_&quot;'s in the data names and PHP and SQL syntax mistakes throughout.Given that, if you are willing to debug the text and the examples, you'll find 99% of what you will need to know to be able to create a database driven website with Apache/PHP/MySQL.If you need the information now, buy it.

Unfortunately, this book doesn't offer enough content to warrant its high price.A full 58 pages is devoted to a PHP function reference which is a bit of a joke because PHP has one of the better online function references available. Code examples are printed with very large font again taking up more space than is necessary.Most important, though, some of these examples are a little bit suspect.They present a Catalog application written using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This would have been valuable except that the classes they create are so specific that they couldn't be re-used -- basically negating the value of OOP to begin with.They do provide a couple of examples of good and bad relational database schema, but that isn't really worth the cost of this book."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Overall, I found this book to serve as an excellent introduction to development using PHP and MySQL. The authors have a refreshing, no-nonsense approach to presenting information on MySQL and PHP quickly and in an easily understandable manner. However, on the flip side, this book is definately not for the beginning programmer. It is clear that the authors assume at least some familliarity with procedural programming languages, especially when presenting their examples. In the end, I heartily recommend this book to its target audience- programmers with some experience looking to learn how to use PHP with MySQL."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"Only one year ago I had no understanding on PHP, MYSQL, Apache, RedHat or Unix, nor did I have any formal training in programming. Now, I have written very elaborate and fully expandable programs that are portable from one application to another and have been promoted Sr. Web Designer in the Internet Systems Department of my company.This book was one of my frequently used library of books which included MySQL, PHP, Apache, Redhat and Unix Manuals. If you have a good base for programming you may not need it but it will help you create a structure for your code to follow, unlike most PHP code that is out on the web now. PHP is a pretty easy to understand language once you make it past the learning curve so, therefore there are tons and tons of horribly disgusting code that works. This book will help you learn to build your code so that you can use it over and over and not limit your ability for expansion. I do recommend this book but only if you accompany it with other important manuals."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"This is a great book, two years ago.

I'm halfway through this book and my head is spinning. I don't think i've taken in a single thing so far, or nothing I could replicate anyway. I was hoping that once I got to the coding examples, i'd start to pick things up. Unfortunately, the author doesn't take you through the creation of the scripts, rather presenting the finished script on the CD for analysis.Anyway, i'm about to head out and buy a book aimed at the PHP beginner level, hopefully PHP Essentials by Julie Meloni, or PHP Fast and Easy Web Development, also by Meloni."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"I bought this book knowing next to nothing about PHP or MySQL. (I did have experience with Active Server Pages so I was familiar with using scripting languages in sites.) It has served as a great reference for me in learning PHP and becoming familiar with MySQL. PHP and MySQL are often used together in building sites and providing everything from installation instructions to function references is a great help. If information exists on a function that is out of the scope of this book, the authors refer you to specific pages on the Web that will provide you with those details.The index could use a little beefing up and there are a lot of typos, but the typos have not taken away from the usefulness of the book.This is the only book I have bought on PHP and MySQL and I don't feel inclined to buy another-- this one is just fine."},{"Title":"MySQL/PHP Database Applications","review":"As a general overview, the content of the book is pretty good, and would have been great... but the authors and editors do a VERY poor job of being specific where necessary, verifying that the scripts offered in the text actually run, and explaining the concepts and language constructs before using them. For the beginner, this book would be confusing as all hell, due to the vague descriptions and error filled examples. For the experienced programmer looking to pick up PHP &amp; mySQL skills, the book is pretty much an exercise in debugging and wince-management as the stream of vague descriptions of the topic at hand wash over you, or some language construct is used with no information about it anywhere close."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I had the opportunity to acquire Harry Pariser's 5th edition to his guidebook, Explore Puerto Rico, recently.This book is a remarkable piece of assistance to any visitor to Puerto Rico. The single most important fact is his attention to detail. He has packed this volume with more useful information than any other similar book - and it is good helpful information to assist the new or veteran travel to Puerto Rico.I have a friend who was at one time in his life was the station manager for the South Pole Station in Antarctica. One of his views of life is that you cannot have too many maps. So what does this have to do with Pariser's guidebook to Puerto Rico? Mr. Pariser's maps are without question the clearest most accurate contained in any guidebook. Sometimes it is a challenge to correctly navigate the back roads of the island. The maps in the Pariser book will clearly be of assistance in this endeavor.In additions to his maps, Pariser has a superior guide and evaluation to the many beaches of Puerto Rico. The desirability of a given beach is in the eye of the beholder and varies with what one wants. Mr. Pariser gives you the information you need to start your search for your perfect Puerto Rican Beach. For example, he discussed the handicapped access to the ocean at Luquillo; other guidebooks seem to overlook this information that is essential to those with disabilities.Mr. Pariser also discusses what you can do to make you beach visit a little more \\"friendly\\" for the sea turtles that lay their eggs on the same beach at night. It is truly a pity that other guidebooks don't demonstrate a similar concern for those with whom we share the beach.The book also contains really first rate discussions of culture, history, environmental concerns, restaurants and hotels. (I do think he was a little too hard on Coors beer thought - read his book to find out why; but remember this is a guidebook to Puerto Rico, not beers of the world. I drink Medallia beer when I am in Puerto Rico; and recommend it over both Coors and Bud!) If I had my choice at the moment, I would be on one of Harry's beaches reading his book to find tomorrow's beach.If you are in the market for a guidebook to Puerto Rico, I heartily recommend you get Harry Pariser's Explore Puerto Rico."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I used this book on a recent trip to Puerto Rico along with the Lonely Planet guide. Explore Puerto Rico was more comprehensive and up to date. I found museums, beaches, snorkeling spots, rock art, restaurants and out of the way hotels that I otherwise would not have found. I compared the two books thoroughly, as I was both in the interior mountainous regions, as well as the beaches. The detailed maps are extremely helpful, as are the tips and charts, and Harry's photography is again: incomparable (I own his other books, as well) He often digs down and gives a lot more information about the culture, and background which I always find refreshing, and his sense of humor is low key. I recommend this book, and his others, as well. Great revised edition!"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"Having used 3 guides on our most recent trip to Puerto Rico, Mr.Pariser's is weak in many aspects. Many of his phone numbers are wrong or have a digit missing. You can guess at which places he writes about and probably never saw in person. A lot of his writing needs proofreading as it looks sloppy and unedited. He doesn't describe restaurants in very helpful ways and seems pretty clueless understanding the culture. In fact, he didn't seem to care very much about what underlies today's Puerto Rico- the history, politics, cultural traditions. This book seems more like a journalistic assignment and less like a meaningful undertaking for the author. Pariser brings no passion to the subject."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. There is a lot of inaccurate information (phone numbers, prices) and there is much that is not included, as compared with other guides. It does seem that the author has &quot;heard&quot; about, rather than experienced first hand, some of the things he includes. For the independent, budget traveller, I would not recommend this book. I just returned from Puerto Rico and used Lonely planet and Let's go PR. Let's go was the best one of the bunch! LP was next best. If you have to choose one, Let's Go would be it. On the other hand, if $$ is not the primary concern, Explore Puerto Rico does include more complete and interesting historical review and details of the environment and makes for a good read for a day at the beach."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"This book takes you off the beaten path and into small towns and villages, through the rainforest (there are pages on El Yunque) and down to explore caves. Pariser likes to explore not only the terrain of Puerto Rico with its natural forests, beaches and snorkeling spots, but he also likes the local color and likes to meet the local people. Every festival day is covered and every little town seems to have one. Of course there are listings of hotels and guesthouses, restaurants and lunch spots, not only in San Juan, but in the surfing mecca of Rincon, in Ponce, and plenty of other places. Bus routes and driving directions are given. A visit to the small island of Culebra is another adventure.Old San Juan gets strong coverage, plus there is a good section where typical Puerto Rican menu items are translated (you'll need that outside of the big hotel area since many residents do not speak English). A quick Spanish Vocabulary in the back gives you the most common phrases at a glance.The history and culture sections are sprinkled throughout the book with lots of opinions on everything from colonialism to greenhouse emissions to the ritual of sea turtles laying their eggs. Pariser packs a lot into a single guide and his historical sidebars are fascinating."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"It was a refreshingly honest look at the island and its culture. Rarely does a guide book both respect a place and give you the 'warts and all' assessment of what goes down there and how. Very glad to have bought and read it!"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"We found this book to be really interesting and helpful. It's funny the silly things some of these posters complain about! We found it to be one of the better books, and we stayed in many smaller places we found in here. It also helped us find nightlife (although there is not a lot in Puerto Rico, except in San Juan) and get around. We think some of these people writing here should write the author with their suggestions so this good book can be even better. We used the author's previous edition some years ago, and this one is much better."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I used this book on a recent trip to Puerto Rico along with the Lonely Planet guide.

It was especially fine for treking the countryside and beachside spots. The book well describes off the beaten track scenic places with surprisingly accurate details on small local sites and restaurants. The maps were a big help as were the color photos, travel tips, and stuffon history, culture, and nature. I think anyone who likes birding, hiking, watersports will be pleased to get a copy of Explore Puerto Rico."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"Puerto Rico means \\"rich port\\" and this guide will introduce the reader to all of the riches that the island has to offer including the only tropical National Forest in the U.S. Detailed visitor information is provided for the major cities, small towns and the outer regions of the main island but this guide also dedicates several pages to each of the two other islands just off of Puerto Rico: Vieques and Culebra. There is even information about the least known of the offshore islands, Mona Island. Readers will find descriptive accounts of music, festivals, foods, sports & sporting events, hiking tours, accommodations and entertainment. Learn how to spot migrating humpback whales between December and May, search the skies for the Puerto Rican parrot that is nearly extinct and explore the diminishing Mangroves that dampen waves and winds. Other interesting information is provided about native arts and crafts, locally produced beer and rum, sugar and coffee plantations, vanilla production and exportation. I visited Puerto Rico twice before reading Explore Puerto Rico and it helped me see that I discovered only a small fraction of what the island has to offer. I'll definitely use this guide on my next visit. Review by JoAnna Carey, Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Puerto Rico. We used three other books, but we thought that this was the best. We found the information (including the phone numbers) to be accurate. We found a few good restaurants with the help of this guide, though we didn't find Puerto Rico to be a culinary paradise by any means. However, we enjoyed the local ice cream place we found in Lares and the Hare Krishna vegetarian restaurant in Old San Juan, both of which and local places which we would have missed if we had not had this book. Also, the inclusion of so many websites and emails, which helped us determine our itinerary prior to our trip, was a big help. (the publisher has helpful information on its website). We particulary enjoyed reading about the rainforest, the tropical dry forest, and other ecological topics. The background information seemed fair and balanced and helped us understand the history of Puerto Rico. If you really want to travel around and explore the island, this is a sound choice."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"The book is thorough with a good bit of detail (although some reviewers said some was inaccurate) but this is a travel guide and not a political book. He is aparantly against the military, people with conservative leanings, the Coors family and probably the European explorers. I think if he writes another travel book he needs to leave out the little quips and inuendos."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I am Puerto Rican and visit the island as often as I can. Besides seeing family, my favorite thing to do is catch live music. I noticed in this guide by Mr.Pariser that he says bomba is an obscure music that only lower class Puerto Ricans listen to. I like bomba, and I know that bomba, which is African-influenced, is pretty popular these days and getting more serious attention because Puerto Ricans are learning their history and are proud of their roots. A lot of jazz musicians are now using bomba in their work. Hopefully it won't require Ricky Martin to bring it to the attention of a so-called expert on the island like Mr.Pariser."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"(Planeta.com Journal) - This fifth edition provides readers essential information for planning your trip to Puerto Rico.

All types of accommodations (including campgrounds) are identified, along with information on horseback riding, bridwatching, hiking, diving, surfing, snorkeling, and more.

However, the writing and editing nearly drove us crazy because of all the errors. Not just the typographical errors and poor grammar in parts (my husband and I both take these things pretty seriously), but the vague and misleadingly simplistic directions through Fajardo to the Hotel Delicias got us lost in a rough part of town at night; the name and descriptions of the Holiday Inn-Ponce and the Howard Johnson near Ponce were mixed up....we called the Holiday Inn to reserve a room, but due to the errors in the book, drove to the wrong side of town to the HoJo. There were wrong phone numbers (and missing digits) for some places, and some of his maps were just plain wrong. As long as you're in full &quot;adventure mode&quot; and willing to be flexible in all respects, this book will be just fine. Just bear in mind that any details (schedules/phone numbers/directions/descriptions) may or may not be accurate. (In all fairness, we did not check the author's website, as listed in the book, to look for updates/corrections prior to our trip....some of these errors may be addressed there.)"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"While the author promotes himself as an environmentalist, and sells his book as the best travel guide in large part because of that, I would like to argue otherwise. First of all, the publisher for Harry's books- Manatee Press- is seemingly Harry's personal venture, as it only publishes books by Harry. I think it is a lot easier to publish a book when you do it yourself than when you need a publisher to back your work. So although many reviewers writing in favor of Harry put down the Lonely Planet guide, I have to say that I would trust the credentials of a writer getting a book published by Lonely Planet before trusting someone who is publishing his own work. Second, there are some pretty clear examples of Harry's environmental sensitivity failing him. He suggests a bike path in El Yunque, for example, but doesn't warn readers it is the only permitted one- the interpretation being you could ride elsewhere too if you want. Another entry tells you where you can watch turtles laying their eggs on a beach- but those beaches are off limits to people during egg-laying in order to protect that activity. And he tells you that if you are diving where local fishermen tie up their gear in water, wear a knife to carry those bothersome lines if they get in your way. Mind you, this is the fishing gear of locals making a living, but don't let it interfere with swimming where you want to. Those inconsistencies make me wonder how good an environmentalist Harry really is. Go ahead and read his book, but read Lonely Planet too because it's better than Harry would admit."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"This guide focuses on recreational activities and the history, culture, and environment of Puerto Rico. There are listings for accommodations and dining, from budget to four-star in key centers, but that is not all. The heart of the book comprises detailed maps, sharp color photos, and descriptions of sports, sporting events, wildlife preserves, environmental centers and historical and cultural sites, complete with address, phone, e-mail, and Web site contacts. Practical details on each town and area are filled with insightful (and often humorous) tips and tidbits. Pariser's book is well researched, thorough, and an essential ingredient when visiting Puerto Rico.&quot; - Gayle Nagle Meyers, Travel Weekly"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"\\"Explore Puerto Rico\\" gives you the feeling you are there, even when you are at home. This book is not just a travel guide, it's also a history lesson, a lesson in basic Spanish and an incredible insight into the culture of Puerto Rico.Broken into sections, Mr. Pariser takes you to all the things there are to do and see on the island. The well known, like El Yunke, the Observatory in Arecibo, Old San Juan and the Condado. But then he takes you on a trip off the beaten path to places like the Museo Cemi in Jayuya, the Tibes Ceremonial Center just north of Ponce and the towns of Aibonito and Cayey just to name a few.You also get to visit Vieques and Culebra, part of Puerto Rico that is also known as the Spanish Virgins. Learn about the bioluminescent bay in Vieques and the nightly turtle watches in Culebra.One of the unique things in this guide is the food section. Not only is the Spanish name given but also a description of the food. Do you like aguacate (avocado), chillo (red snapper) or lechosa (papaya)? Or how about asopao or pastelillos? You can find out what they are on pages 64-65. There are maps and web sites to learn even more about \\"La Isla del Encanto\\" as Puerto Rico is known.With this book in tow, you will get to see Puerto Rico from the inside out. Pack it in your bag and go on a trip to this beautiful lush island that's just waiting to greet you."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, which clearly approaches Puerto Rico as someone who loves it, not just as a tourist. (I knew I'd found a good book when it referred to Dubya as \\"Shrub.\\")But the phone numbers are just appallingly out of date. I called probably twenty or thirty and only one picked up. The book offers free online updates, which is very generous, but not very practical. I bought a guidebook because I'd left my laptop at home. I hope they'll update the book itself soon, as it's a great book, but accurate information is really vital."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"We really enjoyed using this book. We found few errors and appreciated the frank evaluations. We feel that travel guides all have their good and bad parts. Your impression will depend upon who you are (what type of traveler) and what you are interested in. Lets Go is researched by college students, and, while we found it interesting, it lacked depth. Explore Puerto Rico covered some things better and other things less well in comparison to the Lonely Planet and Lets Go guides. We found mistakes in all of the travel guides we used. Practically every travel guide we've ever used has something out of date or a mistake. The official tourist literature sometimes has mistakes. It's just a fact of life. We did find that Explore Puerto Rico had a pretty good sense of humor. We did find the new update on the publisher's site to be of help, along with the various e-mails posted on the Yahoo! group. The e-mails and websites, which were quite comprehensive, were quite good also. We used a road map for navigation, but it's hard not to get lost in Puerto Rico. Signage is poor, and the regular maps, sold at the gas stations, often have inaccuracies. We didn't see that the Hotel Las Delicias had any directions to it. In any event, we always call a hotel first to ask for directions. Some people are just looking for something to complain about! It doesn't seem as if they have traveled much. It's pretty hard to write a travel guide, and we really appreciate the people who do it. We wouldn't like to have to do this job: it seems pretty thankless."},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"A reader Explore Puerto Rico is a typically excellent travel guide of the Caribbean area by this author, who has won an award for his travel writing.

The author crams an incredible amount of useful information into his guides, and this is no exception. We rated it four hearts. -- Heartland Reviews"},{"Title":"Explore Puerto Rico Fifth Edition","review":"When I was planning my trip to Old San Juan,I bought this book. It was hard to tell from Pariser's short entries for there what the accommodations were really like. He doesn't give many details, including describing the locations they're in. Unfortunately, he has really shortchanged one of the most interesting places on the whole island, the Gallery Inn, which he calls The Galleria. Pariser must not have seen for himself what an amazing place this is. Jan D'Esopo uses antiques, art, tropical plants and birds, and one of the best views to the ocean to create a space that is unique. He also doesn't describe with helpful detail how many places there are with good live local music. Pariser spends more time on the big hotels run by corporate chains on San Juan's strip. If you want to really see Old San Juan, don't be gypped. Check Lonely Planet's descriptions."},{"Title":"CRAIG CLAIBORNE'S GOURMET DIET","review":"I've used this book for almost 30 years now.

In many ways it was long ahead of its time, stemming from the author's need to adopt a far more stringent regime after heart problems. Nowadays every cookbook tries to depress you by listing in ghastly detail the entire schedule of health-damaging components in a dish. Written in collaboration with his restaurateur friend Pierre Franey, the author succeeded in showing that it is possible to make food interesting even when some traditional components are omitted or substituted.

While the scale is larger than some of the others, this is appropriate because the others show too many roads. Many times, the other atlases show roads that do not seem to exist or show the incorrect numbers. New Mexico Road and Recreation Atlas is very accurate as far as I can tell. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"Many roads are completely missing in this ill-conceived New Mexico Atlas. I'm afraid that the idea of having two different map styles for each area reduced the level of detail so much."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"I like this map, but it could be much easier to use. It doesn't have any sort of easy-to-use system, aside from a basic index, and so any goodness it contains often goes wasted.It does have a lot of features of southern New Mexico that other maps don't, and a lot of dirt roads that others don't, but it's not necessarily complete.I'd recommend the New Mexico DeLorme map over this one, but used together the two can be very helpful. (Unless you're lost in the maze of cattle roads off of County Highway 52A, off of North 14 between Madrid and Golden. In that case, both maps will fail you, you will make the mistake of using a windmill for a landmark--there are dozens--and you will drive around until you run out of gas. You'll have fun though.)"},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"I used this map for a weeklong trip around north-central New Mexico, and it was very useful. The layout of the maps is different than any atlas I've used - big improvement there. My main criticism is that, as a \\"recreation atlas,\\" it should show you more detail around key recreation areas (e.g., Pecos Wilderness). I thought it would be more similar to a Delorme atlas with detailed hiking landmarks (water towers, powerlines, etc.). It'll get you to the entrance and give you some main forest roads, but I would've prefered some more details and close-up relief maps.Overall, it was a good atlas for highway and biway driving, but not the outdoors guide I was looking for."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"It started for me with the purchase of Benchmark's Washington State road & recreation atlas at Costco. Now I'm the owner of New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and California, which I bought from Amazon at approximately the same price offered by Costco, but Costco outlets only offer the state they're in or immediately surrounding. Lets face it, I'm a map junkie, a roadtrip-a-holic who is always on the lookout for the back road to anywhere. That being said, I try to stay on pavement, at least 98% of the time and am a little color (ok, a lot) blind so most maps with the color coded roads don't help much. The Benchmark maps use dashes and superior detail to make road conditions and names obvious - even for me. If you like to keep to the interstate, you have no need for these, but if you're like me and anxious to explore the outback, buy Benchmark maps."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"Great contour atlas, easy to find objects of interest. The maps are too redundant and the scale is disappointing (I expected at least twice better)."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"I bought this Benchmark atlas and the DeLorme New Mexico atlas both back in 2004. So I do not know the current editions of either book, but can say that of the 2004 versions of these, the DeLorme is greatly superior. It simply shows far more information on the maps. The split design of this atlas also baffles me; I find myself only using the \\"public lands\\" section and totally ignoring the \\"landscape\\" section. The latter does give a better at-a-glance impression of elevations, but I really need to know where the public lands are and otherwise information is duplicated between the two. I'd much rather have more detail in a single map than two coarser-scaled, mostly redundant maps. Nonetheless, for what it does show I cannot fault this map. I just wish it showed more.If the DeLorme atlas weren't around this would be a must-have; but I have the DeLorme atlas and so this mostly gathers dust."},{"Title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"Beautiful, detailed, and loaded with information"},{"Title":"Song of La Selva: A Story of a Costa Rican Rain Forest (The Nature Conservancy)","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to the rain forest and poison dart frogs for children.

At the time Carson wrote it, it was one of the few books on the Civil Rights Movement that didn't focus on Martin Luther King and SCLC, and as such provided a welcome addition, even corrective, to the mainstream narrative of the movement. It is also a brilliant analysis of the dynamics of a reform movement and the tensions between leader centered and group centered styles of leadership. The analysis of Bob Moses and his approach to grass roots empowerment is right on target and provides a whole new way for thinking about Freedom Summer and organizing in Mississippi. This book is not for the fainthearted--its academic prose is dense at times and details can be a little confusing for those unfamiliar with SNCC personnel, hence four stars and not five. Nonetheless, it's worth taking time with, and I assign this book regularly for upper level directed studies and recommend it to students for research papers. Whether or not SNCC's achievements were compromised by the antics of former members in the 80s and 90s, Carson's book is a great analysis of its formation, tactics, and dissolution."},{"Title":"In Struggle : SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"This book is a great account of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, which was started in 1960 in regard to Segregation on Americas buses and in the Woolworth dining room. This book leaves out no account, and anyone who had anything to do with the movement and SNCC is mentioned in this book. Carson went all out, and I think this book should be required reading in every Civil Rights History course."},{"Title":"In Struggle : SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s","review":"In Struggle recounts the progression of the SNCC from its early days of assimilationism and conventional middle class values, through its radical and militant period, its separatist and provocative period, and then back again into conventionalism and low-level activism. Many SNCC members during its radical period, debated whether the victim should become the executioner. Instead, the victim becomes part of the system, such as Marion Barry's accession to the mayor's office in Washington, D.C. And the idealism of the movement went out the window as well, when in the 1990s much more mundane pursuits took over Barry's life, including crack cocaine and prostitutes. One reason for the winding-down of the SNCC may stem from the conditions that spawned it. Under an oppressive system of the Jim Crow South, the SNCC had a common enemy to fight, and clear goals to achieve. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act had been passed, and subsequent advances were made at the legislative level, the goals and mission became less clear and less defined. Now that so much had been achieved, the SNCC began to fight amongst itself as each faction attempted to secure ever smaller slices of the revolutionary pie. The cautious liberalism of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations proved fatal to the more ambitious fervor of the SNCC; the legislation acted almost as a safety valve, relieving the pressure that had encouraged the formation of the SNCC. SNCC students were, in their heyday, overcompensating for all the resentment they had from being historically marginalized and held down. SNCC members had discovered their voice and used it passionately, but once people started listening to them, SNCC found itself in the position of not knowing what to say."},{"Title":"Homeopathic Medicine for Dogs: A Handbook for Vets and Pet Owners","review":"Like other books on homeopathy, this book is best used together with a comprehensive materia medica. It's important to keep in mind that the listed remedies are suggestions only and may or may not fit the individual patient's symptom picture. Having said that, this book covers a wider range of ailments than most books on veterinary homeopathy. The introduction to homeopathy section, however, is very brief and there is little information on taking a case and selecting the correct remedy, so this is not the best book for someone new to homeopathy (check out books by Dr. Don Hamilton or Dr. Christopher Day first).In addition to the guide to canine ailments, there are descriptions of thirteen constitutional types, excerpts from readers' letters, and some interesting essays on veterinary homeopathy including one on homeopathic alternatives to vaccinations."},{"Title":"Homeopathic Medicine for Dogs: A Handbook for Vets and Pet Owners","review":"I actualy refer to the german original (12th edition) published in Stuttgart in 1998, supposing the english version has the same content.This book has helped me and my chows overcome quite a few problems when I didn't feel comfortable with the sometimes &quot;radical&quot; solutions offered by my vet.

Being that Stovall is the first African American doing so, especially in 1970s America, he is rightfully afraid. It is believed that taking them - the two boys - to London, will protect them a bit more than keeping them in the states, however, the villains of this entry also have people in the U.K., and they plan on kidnapping the boys to get the American senator to leave the election.The \\"Shaft Girl\\" of this entry is Indra Richardson, a half-Asian Indian/half-white girl Shaft meets when he is undercover at the British school where the senator's sons are attending.For me, there were some slow points in this novel, especially when there is a focus on the villains. It was also a bit confusing trying to tell them apart when these villians are introduced in the beginning as well as towards the end, when they (particularly two brothers) mix-up their own plans towards the climax.However, with all that said, I thought this was an enjoyable novel overall, just not as strong as some other Shaft-related novels I've read."},{"Title":"The Tiny Giants Trilogy: A Collection of Bedtime Stories for Grown-ups","review":"How would I describe them, let's see - think Shel Silverstein meets \\"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" meets \\"The Far Side\\".

The Tiny Giants Trilogy is original through and through--from its conception to the mode of its expression.

In spite of societal pressures and expectations, these women lead happy, fulfilling, satisfied lives. Some have found ways to have children and/or a significant other in their lives without the framework of a traditional marriage, and some have not -- but none of them have become the bitter, twisted &quot;spinsters&quot; our society would seem to expect them to be. I found this book to be an inspiration, and I think ALL women should read it; even if you're not &quot;flying solo&quot; now, you might find yourself doing so at some point in the future. This book can show you how to do it -- and even how to enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo: Single Women in Midlife","review":"This book basically describes single women in midlife as uniformly content, financially well-off, healthy, and lovin' it. While I think this may be true for a significant proportion of us, I absolutely know it's not true for all.

An important note about this book: the facts of these seven children's trek across frontier country also form the basis of a Dutch author's novel De Kinderkaravaan. It was my faint memory of the Afrikaans translation, entitled Die Kinderkaravaan, which prompted an online search and which led me to discover The Valiant Seven.

Even the promise of a surprise twist at the end cannot keep me interested.Comparisons to The Godfather are not only unfounded but sacrilegious. Here is a fair and unbiased opinion. Double Dealing reads like the first draft of a creative writing student. No research was done, whatsoever. The story is supposedly set in 1968, yet the author writes of answering machines, designer jeans, TV shows like All in the Family and M*A*S*H, and movies like The Bad News Bears which are all products of the 70s. There is no knowledge of police procedure. The story fails to create even an inkling of suspense. The characters have all the depth of cardboard cutouts.The editing is terrible. New paragraphs begin in mid-sentence. The narrative changes haphazardly. I wanted to like this book and was sure I would when I read the rave reviews but in the end I feel like I got Double Dealt.I know how difficult it is to get something published, that's what the one star is for."},{"Title":"Hero for Hire (Seduction Romance)","review":"MacKenzy Cord has dreams and ambitions of his future. He works as a bounty hunter to acquire a bank roll for the small ranch he wishes to purchase. And he has his sights set on a likely lass he plans to court. Then all his plans fall through when the lovely lass he has in mind runs away from her father. Savannah Carrington just couldn't take it any more. She has a mind of her own and knows what she wants. Her father is planning her life for her and has even picked out her husband. Mac is called in by George Carrington to find and bring back his wayward daughter. He may have been hired to do a job but Mac has plans of his own. Hero for Hire is a delightfully spirited romantic western tale of a bounty hunter and his prey on a rocky road to romance. A well written tale offering a neat plot with some unexpected twists."},{"Title":"Hero for Hire (Seduction Romance)","review":"In 1892 Angel Creek, George Carrington cuts a deal with bounty hunter Mackenzie Cord. If Mac finds and returns home George's daughter Savannah, he can marry the woman if she agrees. Since Mac became a bounty hunter so he could earn money to wed his beloved best friend Savannah, he readily accepts the deal.Mac catches up with Savannah in the Jamestown, New York jail. Pretending to be her spouse, he persuades the local sheriff that Savannah is not a cohort of a bank robber, but an innocent victim. Savannah refuses to return home with Mac until she regains her stolen money. With an opportunity at hand, all Mac has to do is convince the stubborn Savannah that they can be friends and lovers forever.HERO FOR HIRE is an amusing Americana romance that stars two enchanting lead characters. The story line is fun and humorous especially when Mac has to keep his head when he is around his beloved, but is sort of a one-joke tale. Still, fans will genuinely like the protagonists who, with the support cast, provide a picture of the Gay Nineties in upstate New York and South Carolina that showcases Sheridon Smythe's writing abilities.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hero for Hire (Seduction Romance)","review":"Mackenzy Cord has loved Samantha Carrington since he was ten years old.

So this may account for my bias, but I believe that his photos of modern-day China are among the best taken during the post-Tiananmen era. During my decade as a correspondent in China, I always wanted to work with Mark because I thought his gritty, in-your-face pictures captured a side of China that often was overlooked. Instead of showing us the by-now stock shots of high-rises and neon lights, he took viewers to the street level, his 28mm lens always getting reeeeaallly close up into people's faces.

G. T. Griffith's work, now some 70 years old, remains one of the most in-depth and scholarly studies on the hired soldiers of ancient Greek and Successor State armies available for the average layperson.The states examined include: Philipian and Alexandrian Macedon and Greece; Alexander's immediate successors; post Alexandrian Macedon; post-Alexandrian Greece; the Ptolemaic Kingdom; the Seleucid Empire; Pergamum and Pontus; and the Hellenistic colonies of western Europe and Africa. The origins, history, and numbers of the mercenary units of all of these kingdoms are examined in detail; the information is drawn from a variety of Classical sources. Griffith closes his book with chapters on the origins, recruitment, pay, and maintenance of the mercenaries.The mercenary bands in the Hellenistic world came from all across the world as the Greeks knew it and brought many fighting styles and weapons with them. They included Gaulish cavalrymen - who, despite their barbaric appearance and behavior revolutionized cavalry warfare as the Greeks knew it; Thracians, who were known both for their skillful light cavalry and their ferocious light infantry; hoplites, archers, and light cavalry from fellow Hellenistic and Hellenized states (such as the famous Spartan adventurers who fought during the Punic Wars, and the light cavalrymen of Tarentum in Italy); and assorted Illyrians, Africans, Italians, Spaniards, and Easterners who all found their way into the armies of Alexander the Great and his successors over the course of two centuries.Overall, this is an excellent, irreplaceable source for someone seeking to learn of the significant role played by mercenaries in the Greek and Macedonian armies of the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd Centuries BC, and their organization and national origins."},{"Title":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel (American Indian Literature and Critical Studies Series)","review":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel is solid, a real powerhouse of thoughtful readings and appropriate critical theory applied to highlight the diverse stories analyzed in this text. Owens examines the novels of Mourning Dove, Ridge, McNickle, Momaday, Dorris, Erdrich, Silko, and Vizenor while using an accessible voice and with generous notes, index, and bibliography. In his analysis he visits many of the social and political struggles each writer has encountered in their lives and represented in their writing. Other Destinies is not intended to serve the political ends of issues such as sovereignty, though it does examine the complex political climates in which these works were written. The biographical information on the political circumstances influencing Mourning Dove and John Rollin Ridge are particularly interesting for this reason. There are a few critics, both Indian and non-Indian, who wish that Owens had chosen different baseline issues, (their own political issues), to highlight in his critical examination of these novels. Owens chose, however, what he knows best and what was important to these particular texts.For decades, centuries, the will of white America has largely expressed the desire of the politically powerful to erase American Indians from the North American landscape. Today even, if one views the efforts of such as Slade Gorton, the senator from Washington State, the effort continues. And in many ways, they have been successful. More than 50 percent of those who identify as American Indians do not live on what is today considered \\"Indian land,\\" and too many have lost all contact with the land and cultures and stories of their people. But many still do retain at least vestigial and often much larger pieces of the old stories and traditions, and are working to place them back into a communal whole. For them, the mere prospect of identity must come before they would even consider the land to which their people were moved decades or centuries earlier. For everything there is a season.In Other Destinies Owens analyzes the writings of a number of full and mixedblood Indians authors whose collective voice is growing louder with each passing year. These writers illustrate issues important to themselves; some authors are strongly rooted in place, others are only just discovering their places following the disastrous relocation Diaspora. Owens has built a sound historical and critical framework from which to examine all of these stories. These authors, like Owens, all write of their family stories and belief systems, and of the importance of place, when they know that place or adopt a new one. They are working to graft those connections into their modern lives through the power of their words."},{"Title":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel (American Indian Literature and Critical Studies Series)","review":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel stands alone in its completelook at the history of fiction written by Native American writers. Though(fortunately) there are now so many Indian writers that this book could not include them all, Owens give a good account of many who broke new ground in their relatively recent day of producing literary fiction. Including N.Scott Momaday, Louise Erdrich, Michael Dorris, Gerald Vizenor, Leslie Marmon Silko and others, this text, written by Dr. Owens, himself Native American of Choctaw, Cherokee and Irish descent, holds Indian texts to the same literary standards as other modern literature and finds them of equal quality. Though authoritative, this is a very readable text which received a good review in the New York Times Review of Books. Owens also writes good fiction, and could have included his own works in here, but didn't. See Wolfsong, Sharpest Sight, Bone Game and Nightland."},{"Title":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel (American Indian Literature and Critical Studies Series)","review":"I found Louis Owens' book after I wrote Inherit the Tide. Funny I didn't think to look for something like this before. Maybe it was because Inherit The Tide poured forth so spontaneously. With hindsight I would say Owens is right on the mark, alarmingly so. His overarching theme of revealing the main thread of Native American novels as one of self awareness and self identity nails the issue. His familiarity with works of great Native American works and writers links his presentation of examples straight to the reader.I would describe the author as a scholar. I reached this conclusion bsed on the content of \\"Destiny\\", not a biography. It is well done, perhaps a bit stilted but this takes it into more believeable territory. It is an admirable work. Good Job."},{"Title":"Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel (American Indian Literature and Critical Studies Series)","review":"I've been struggling with this book since it was first published. I've seen it influence dozens of other scholars who, for the most part, rave about its merits. When I read this book for the first time I was deeply immersed in study of many of the books Owens writes about. My initial experince in reading the book was quite mixed. I would find myself saying &quot;right on&quot; in one paragraph, followed by &quot;nonsense&quot; in the next.Louis Owens writes well and communicates a perspective regarding the creative work of Native American Indian writers that is widely shared by many who study these writers professionally. His own novels are worth reading, and he seemed like a warm and friendly person when I've met him at conferences.With all these positive attributes, why does this book deserve three stars? I disagree with Owens critical emphasis; his argument has been influential. He claims that &quot;identity&quot; is the central theme of Native writing. He argues that all Native writers must come to terms with their own mixedblood identity, and with consequent marginalization in two worlds. There is no question that identity is an important issue, but it is far from the central one. For many Native writers it is insignificant. For some, it is central. For others, it is an issue subordinated under other more significant issues. Identity is part of a complex of issues (land, resources, spirituality, images, and stereotypes) that are ultimately concerned with issues of self-control by individuals and communities. For tribal peoples in the United States the central issue, if there is one, is sovereignty. Because of the results of histories of denationalization (a word employed by Cherokee writers in the 1830s) many Native American Indian people are trying to find their way home (as some writers have put it). But, many others have never left home and have never suffered a crisis of self-identity. The academy, by and large, finds issues of identity a quite palatable way to accept literatures of difference because doing so does not require recognizing systemic problems in some of the fundamental assumptions of American colonization."},{"Title":"Lily's In London?!

Kresha is my favorite character and I was so sad when it hardly mentions any of them at all. I also didn't get the whole \\"pilgramige\\" thing. I wish they made it a bit clearer."},{"Title":"Lily's In London?! (Young Women of Faith, Lily 13)","review":"In this episode of the Lily series, Lily's in London?!, written by Nancy Rue, Lily's father is taking his family to Oxford, England for a year so he can teach at the university there. Lily, like her siblings Joe and Tessa, has to leave her school and friends. Their older brother, Sam, stays behind in the States.Lily goes to England with an attitude. She doesn't want to leave everything behind and she doesn't like her new home. The house in Oxford has only three bedrooms so she has to share a room with younger sis Tessa who can be a pest; her mother is home schooling the kids; and Lily doesn't have any friends in England. What is she supposed to do?In addition to being out of sorts about her new life situation, she finds herself having difficulty feeling close to God. Over the course of a few days she starts exploring her new surroundings. In the process she meets several people - a nun at the Church of England, a girl who lives down the street, the son of a college professor - who teach her that God can be found in all the little details of life as well as the big ones.What I Like: I liked reading the story because the author included lots of description about places in England that really exist. I've been to England and the author's voice was authentic in terms of making the places seem real, because they really are!Also, as always, the author weaves important lessons into the storyline.What I Dislike: Maybe it's just me, but I think it a bit pretentious for Lily's family to stay at Claridge's in London. Claridge's is a five-star hotel that caters to the wealthy. With rooms that cost about 250 pounds per night (that translates to almost $500 per night), it's not someplace most people can afford to stay. Most readers just can't relate to that.Also, the title is a bit misleading. Lily does make a trip to London, but it's at the end of the book. Most of the story is centered around her new life in Oxford.Overall Rating: Very good.Christine M. Irvin - Christian Children's Book Review"},{"Title":"P-40 Warhawk Pilot's Flight Operating Manual","review":"This is one terrific gift! I've been a modeler for a long, long time and I always love to have detailed references for my kits. This is one special book in that regard, as it has cockpit views of the plane and what's really neat, you can read all about the performance of the Warhawk and how you were supposed to fly it. It's absolutely fascinating to flip thru this!! I've been a fan of this plane since I was a kid and \\"Baa Baa Blacksheep\\" was a show on television. I was simply glued to the screen! Not to mention the John Wayne \\"Flying Tigers\\" film which was filled with P-40s. What a unique plane with such a unique history -- and this book really does put you in the pilot's seat. It's the exact manual the men who flew it used to acquaint themselves with this warbird! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Medical Terminology Specialties: A Medical Specialties Approach with Patient Records","review":"I'm starting school in January and wanted to get a head start so I purchased this book.

The drawback was that text was brief and it was obvious that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in depth and detail with a slew of full-page/full-colored pictures that ran the gamut of the book. The distinguishing feature is the book's inclusion of many little-seen pictures across-the-board, but the sepia-toned photograph (not painting) of Madame Adele Bloch-Bauer* topped everything else off as it was the first I have ever seen in the plethora of English language books I have read on the subject matter.*Adele Bloch-Bauer was a married socialite who was widely speculated to have had a long-time love affair with Gustav Klimt. She was arguably Klimt's most notable muse who inspired the artist in creating his best works of the \\"Gold Period\\", from the popular (even clich&eacute;d) painting of \\"The Kiss\\" to \\"Judith & Holofernes\\" to her many extraordinary full-length portraits beautifully decked out in sumptuous gold paint and glitter.Given the dearth of books in English language on WW, I would recommend aficionados to delve into literature on some of the most representational, larger-than-life characters of the Secession movement:(1) \\"Gustav Klimt & Emilie Floge: An Artist and His Muse\\" by Wolfgang G. Fischer - a look at Secessionist fashion and the illusive platonic love between the two protagonists;(2) \\"Gustav Klimt\\" by C.M. Nebehay - one of the most insightful accounts ever written on the artist and his collaborators' involvement with WW;(3) \\"Klimt\\" by Frank Whitford - well-written section on the construction and development of Palais Stoclet in Brussels, the most impressive mansion built and its interior meticulously designed and adorned by Josef Hoffman & the forerunners of the WW movement;(4) \\"Egon Schiele\\" by Frank Whitford - a study on the short life of the wayward artist and its contributions to the movement; and(5) \\"Kokoschka and Alma Mahler\\" by Alfred Weidinger - a walk through the tumultuous love-hate relationship between the most famous femme fatale and her artist lover of the period."},{"Title":"Wiener Werkstatte: Design in Vienna 1903-1932","review":"Excellent Book! Highly Recommended. I used it for my architectural history class project and it turned out perfect.Has everything on Wiener Werkstatte to get an A +."},{"Title":"Wiener Werkstatte: Design in Vienna 1903-1932","review":"This is my favorite art book. I love it because it visually shows how a lithograph goes from a print, to a wallpaper, to a textile print, to a fashion design, to a photograph of said design, and ends up in a painting (Klimt's). The process is amazing."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book about Richard Ramirez, the so-called Night Stalker, is simply one of the best, most painstakingly researched books I have ever read in the true crime genre. Philip Carlo takes you through every single facet of the Night Stalker case, from the victims and thier families, to the life story of Richard Ramirez and his family, through the trials and the evidence and even the groupies that gathered around Ramirez during his lentghy trial.Carlo takes you down slowly, down into the mind of Richard Ramirez. By the time you realize where you are, its almost too late; you understand the Night Stalker. The groupies make sense. You feel the bewilderment of the victims. You understand the drive of the dectectives and see flaws in the system. And maybe, just maybe, you understand why someone like Doreen Ramirez would be so obsessed with a killer that she would make it her life's mission to marry him on San Quentin's death row.Unlike many true crime novels, where the \\"shocking photos\\" are nothing more than pictures of the places and the peripheral people, Carlo has photos of crime scenes, Ramirez in various stages of his life, the women who were obsessed with him, the outrageous trial behavior. One tiny dissapointment: couldn't the photo of Laura Kendall (undeniably gorgeous but unmentioned in the book) be replaced by a shot of his supporters from the Church of Satan in court?All in all though, this is a work to rival Graysmith's in depth coverage of the Zodiac killer. I highly reccomend it to fans of good true crime writing."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Though I found this book annoyingly badly edited, in terms of numerous typos and grammatical errors, that did not stop me from being incredibly absorbed in reading this, the single best true-crime non-fiction I've ever read. Philip Carlo did a truly awesome job of researching this book, and though his accounting of the crimes is painstaking, it never, ever gets tedious or boring. Carlo did an incredible job of getting into the mind of the killer, his background, everything true crime non-fiction usually leaves out, to the reader's usual dissatisfaction. His accounting of the crimes was stunning, in that the reader finds his/herself &quot;right there,&quot; and can relate so well to the victims that the reader feels, sees, hears what they saw....including terror. At the same time, Carlo uses absolutely no gratuitous material, which he could easily do. He fully describes, in enormous and graphic detail,crimes that were, in themselves, graphic, bloody, sexually violent, and horrifying, without ever once crossing the line into gratuitous &quot;stuff.&quot; Another reviewer said that Carlo lets the crimes speak for themselves, and that's really true...he doesn't need to embelish these crimes, and he doesn't. This is really a mesmerizing and engaging book. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in forensics or true crime."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The detail with which Carlo writes of the murders is impressive, although the calibur of his writing could be better. I found it difficult to put the book down up until the apprehension of Ramirez, which takes place at maybe pg. 300 or so. Thereafter, the narrative becomes somewhat bogged down with superfluous details, such as meticulous but frankly boring recitation of courtroom antics and other minutiae that ultimately has no bearing on the outcome of the case or the story in general. Admittedly, it's tough to achieve the same level of excitement in the second act for obvious reasons; however, if you pick up a copy of Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter\\" you'll find that it's not quite an impossible feat."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Absolutely the best-written and researched book about a serial killer I have ever read. Philip Carlo turns in a stellar performance detailing every aspect on the psychotic rampage of America's most deadly, viscous and sadistic serial killer. The extensive research was evident in the way Philip narrates the actual crimes themselves. A cold blooded, spine chilling account of Ramirez's unreal invasions of his innocent victim's homes while they slept had me checking my doors and windows at night. Fast reading exciting recounts of Ramirez's bloody spree and the LAPD's urgent chase to bring him down. The in-depth look into the Night Stalker's family history and upbringing helps explain what turned a little boy into a monster. The coverage of the court trial is very comprehensive and gives us a close up look at the inner workings of a major criminal case. Carlo regales us with a well-written, colorful and detailed look in to the mind and crimes of the Night Stalker. A must read for true crime aficionados."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"--with the possible exception of IN COLD BLOOD. Michaud and Aynesworth's THE ONLY LIVING WITNESS (about Ted Bundy) is probably the finest exploration of the genesis of homicidal mania, but for detail and incredible narrative drive, no true crime book I've ever read tops this one. May it always remain in print."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Probably the most enigmatic and attractive of the famous serial killers, Richard took LA by storm in the mid 80's with his brutal and Satan-fuelled attacks. His ferocity was second to none and he dedicated all of his victims' suffering to the power of Satan. Without displaying an iota of remorse for his victims or their families, he was sentenced to death in San Quentin. Philip Carlo encapsulates the fear of the community and the passion of Ramirez as he disects the attacks, the investigation leading to his arrest, and the bizarre marriage to a 'groupie' who fell in love with Richard during the trial. The details are harrowing and it's hard to believe that the two victims whom he let live could lead anything close to a normal life. The book is unputdownable and the 550 or so pages disappear without the reading ever being aware. I have a lot of serial killer books in my collection and I rate this as one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. I say pleasure in its broadest sense, of course."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Although comparing the book to Capote's masterpiece &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is a misunderstanding, this story of the notorious killer Richard Ramirez is an excellent read. Because of numerous praises for it, I will not repeat them here; instead, I will point to some of the weak points of the book.In the very beginning of &quot;Night Stalker&quot;, Carlo tends to embellish the story. Thus, the text seems artificial, particularly due to the use of some unnecessary, exaggerated metaphors (&quot;The cocaine raced to his brain and limbs like a speeding train on its way to no good&quot;). The opening chapter suffers most here: it seems that either Carlo wrote it in the very end, when he was tired and impatient, or in the very beginning, when he was not sure of the style he would use. Fortunately, he drops this annoying way of writing very quickly, and what we get then is a chilling, well-written story. In the last sections, however, Carlo almost loses it again when he dwells too much on meaningless details of the trial, almost as if he simply wanted to make the book a bit longer, and thus get more.The photo inlay should contain more reproductions of the newspaper articles from the Night Stalker &quot;era&quot; (particularly the ones telling of his having been identified, on the day he was captured - what did the &quot;La Opinion&quot; journal that Ramirez first saw his mugshot in look like on that day, for example?), and a few pictures from the day he was apprehended - such as a shot of the police escorting him in his &quot;Jack Daniels&quot; t-shirt.Also, a chapter with some more personal view from Philip Carlo would be great. What does _he_ think about Ramirez? Is he just a cash cow for him? Carlo says to have spent over 100 hours talking to Ramirez; how about an &quot;Interview&quot; chapter with some actual quotes from the conversation? What was the Stalker's language? What was Phil's first impression of him - and vice versa?If (when?) Ramirez gets executed, and Philip Carlo writes a new chapter on it, he might consider adding the above as well."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I got this book expecting it to me really good after reading all the reviews. As some people said on here the first few hundred pages are very good but when you get the trial part it just draaaaaaaaaaags on!! I mean the author wrote EVERY single thing that was said and happened in the court, if someone blinked he would put that in. It did get a bit better after the trial part when it went into the actual sentence and spoke about his new wife he married in jail, etc. Still there are much better books out there on serial killers."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I read this 592 page book in less than two days because it was so in-depth, well written, and just plain interesting.Richard Ramirez is the most unique serial killer that I have ever read about. Unlike most serial killers who have a \\"preferred\\" victim (ie, Blond, Female, and/or young), Ramirez was an equal opportunity rapist/killer. With Carlo's book, readers get inside the mind of Ramirez and are offered an up close view of the crimes. As a result, readers will most likely never sleep with a window open or an unlocked door again...irregardless if they live in the big city or small town.Fascinating and interesting. From the crimes, to the trial, to the Ramirez \\"groupies.\\" Definitely a must-read for true crime fans."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I lived across the street, two houses down from one of the murders.

I didnt finish it so soon becuase it was so short, i finished it becuase it was great. The writer puts you inside of the killers shoes.

Would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book gave me the chills while reading about the attacks, which Carlo makes the reader feel like he is in the room with the &#34;Night Stalker&#34;. The entire story will have you begging for more, you will simply not want to close it once it is open."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book was of particular interest to me because I remember being genuinely afraid of the Night Stalker as a child. What could be scarier than a man randomly entering houses and killing those inside? I tore into this book devouring page after page... that is until I got toward the end of the recount of the trial.Although I'm not a fan of the author's writing style, the book was well done. Philip Carlo brought forth the details that may or may not have been gathered by the various media during the activity, capture and conviction of Richard Ramirez. But the book, just like the book Helter Skelter, hit a snag when recounting the trial. Carlo dedicated close to 200 pages to Richard Ramirez's trial. Whereas I believe coverage of the trial is important and many authors neglect it, Carlo gives too much time and attention to the trial proceedings. Eventually the reading becomes mundane, laborious and repetitive. The entire trial lasted 14 months and I felt like it took me that long to finally get through it all. It doesn't take very long to understand the defense and their strategy, the prosecution, the judge, the jury and other ancillary players, yet Carlo rehashes the same themes throughout his documentation of the trial: the defense was inadequate, the prosecution was frustrated, Richard was annoyed, the jury was bored, the witnesses were grief stricken, the groupies and the media were en masse, etc. A retelling of the trial and it's key components gives the reader a peak inside the justice system for better or for worse, but I got frustrated with it all after 150 pages of various trial happenings.In his detailed coverage of the trial Carlo illustrated one of the more peculiar things about Richard Ramirez, and that was his groupies. It wasn't a shock to me that he had groupies because Ted Bundy, Charles Manson and even Joseph Fritzl (imprisoned his daughter for 24 years and repeatedly raped her) had devotees that were in awe of them and their bad boy image. But the Night Stalker groupies were way beyond anything I'd imagined. Even one of the jurors fell in love with him!!?? I don't know if the groupies were an indication of the degradation of society or just the incredibly fickle minds and low self-esteems of those women. In any case, their antics quickly went from intriguing to aggravating to utterly annoying.After all my griping about the superfluous trial recount, the book is still well worth reading. Philip Carlo did an exceptional job with the book, he even presented pictures of some of the groupies. If you read the book, be ready for a roller coaster that flattens out towards the end."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This is another gruesome tale of a nice young man gone off the deep end. The story is well told and interesting; almost makes one feel sorry for the guy."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":".What the assailant did at each crime is described. This is a better approach than Anne Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" where the crimes are described without involving the criminal.In fact, the author goes into so much detail, it becomes a wonder where he got it all. Did Richard Ramirez really tell him all this or is there some artistic liberty going on?Unfortunately, the second part of the book describes the trial in motion-by-motion detail. Eventually this drags down the book, making finishing it a chore."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The book is truly a page-turner. It may seem like a long read, but it goes by very quickly. Recommended for anyone who is interested in criminals."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I found that the book documented the details reasonably well but the the level of analysis and the quality of writing generally were poor. In fact for the most part the book lacked any significant insights and told you nothing that the daily papers wouldn't have already covered.As mentioned elsewhere, Carlo's biggest error was confusing volume and detail for quality. He persisted in the second section of the book, to recount the events of the trial in monotonous, irrelevant detail. He just didn't seem to understand what was important and what wasn't so it's ALL there. I wound up skipping through pages of it. And the book made no real attempt at analysis at all. His understanding of all the main characters and events was very unidimensional and lacked any really critical evaluation. Compare this title for instance to Brian Masters books on either Dennis Nilsen or Jeffrey Dahmer, books which radiate quality and intelligence. I'm not sure why Carlo is as celebrated as he is...he was a very ordinary, very limited writer."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"If you're into true crime, you want to know all the details of the crimes, the victims' stories, and the thoughts and actions of the killer. Carlo's book delivers on every level. You get the full background of Ramirez, each victim, and horrific details about each murder as if Carlo were actually there for all of them. The amount of time and dedication the author put into writing this phenomenal book is astounding, and it's obvious within the first few pages. There were so many times I had to put the book down for a minute just to process the horror, and just as many nights where I simply couldn't put the book down and relied on cat naps to survive!Ramirez's story is one that MUST be read by anyone who enjoys reading about serial killers. It still haunts me. The only negative about this book is that it sort of ruins other more poorly written books in the genre (Hello, Ann Rule). Because he does such a thorough job and the story is so bizarre, Carlo sets a ridiculously high standard. I've read three books about various serial killers since this one, along with several prior, and Night Stalker still reigns supreme. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"If you are into true crime, this is an astounding book.

We want to understand them, perhaps in an effort to protect ourselves \\"next time\\". Given that, the Satanic aspect of Richard's story is also quite compelling. No connetion is made to other crimes of a \\"Satanic\\" nature in the same area at the same time, except perhaps at crimelibrary.com, where Katherine Ramsland, PhD suggests that Ramirez was influenced by the \\"Satanic Panic\\" at the time without necessarily being connected to the many crimes she then proceeds to list of a Satanic nature in that area at that time, yet stating that survivors of Satanic ritual abuse were unable to make their case due to \\"lack of evidence.\\" Pardon me. Ramirez was influenced by mass delusion? I think not.There is no connection to other Satanic crimes made in this book, nor probably in any others about the Night Stalker. How the author managed to describe what was going on in Ramirez' head as the crimes were described is beyond me, unless it is gleaned from conversations he had with the Stalker himself after the trial. What is the truth? What was left out? Will we ever know?Richard Ramirez was sentenced to death 19 times, and his death sentence is being held on appeal prior to his being tried for yet even more murders in San Francisco. He is, that is, still alive today. His victims, of course, are not.He is also one of those intriguing serial killers who are more than willing to die, to face the consequences of their crimes, not so much because he believes he's done wrong and has \\"found Jesus,\\" like many other ludicrous killers on death row, but because he believes what he did he did for Satan, who is waiting for him.But, \\"justice\\" being what it is, the man is still alive, and lived to find and marry a young, devoted, \\"Christian\\" virgin who dogged him along with a gaggle of groupies who fought over his visitation hours for years before, during and after the trial.He was supported, during the trial, by Anton LaVey and other High Satanists, who showed up in court on a regular basis. He is, indeed, attractive and mesmerizing, quite like a snake, I imagine, that you want to be able to master before he masters you. I, too, found myself strangely drawn to him -- but not enough to want to write to him, call him, or visit. If he wasn't connected prior to the murders, if he truly was working alone, I'm sure they are finding him quite useful now...and he's even more attractive now that the state has fixed his teeth, giving him a beautiful smile.Sneaking into people's bedrooms in the dead of night and killing them in their sleep, raping, shooting, stabbing, sodomizing and terrorizing men, women and children in a blind rage; the child of Mexican immigrants, American citizens who prayed fervently to Jesus while struggling with poverty and the ramifications of the nuclear testing at Los Alamos -- how much of this did we bring on ourselves?A fascinating look at the underside of American history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book was one of the best written true crime books i have ever read. I read all 559 pages in 2 days, unable to put it down. It got into my dreams at night, and I'd awaken petrified that Richard Ramirez was at my window. It's THAT good!The book starts off with very detailed descriptions of the crimes, from the killers point of view, goes on to the investigation (which is in no way boring as in other true crime novels), and then leads into Richards family life. It finishes up with the trial and the sickening marrige of Richard to Doreen. Yes, as it turns out, someone wanted to marry him.It's a very well written book, that will keep you up at night and keep you reading. I recommend highly!!!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I've read a lot true crime books, most of them you'll find in the recommendations amazon will offer you as soon as you'vepurchased this one. This book however will make you consider buying something for protection or at least make you a littlemore aware of the weak spots of your house. The nickname \\"Nightstalker\\" in my opinion is a bad choice. According to the bookRamirez never really stalked, he randomly(?) entered homes at night and terrorized/killed the people in them. The first partof the book discribes these crimes in detail. What shocked me the most was, how much bad police work enabled R. to repeat thesevicious acts over and over again. One can only hope, that the authorities have read this book too and learned from it.As for Ramirez himself I admit he had a bad start in life (like many, many others), but to be honest I still want him wiped out.Something like this should not be alive. Not on the streets, not in the joint. His Groupies in my opinion are all sickos andshould be under 24/7 surveillance. They must carry the potential within them otherwise they would not support this scumbag.The lovely Mrs. Ramirez included."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"In his true crimer, THE NIGHT STALKER, author Philip Carlo has accomplished a beautifully and intelligently written work about 1980s Los Angeles serial killer and enthusiastic Satanist, Richard Ramirez. Every time I think I've read about the absolute worst serial killer imaginable, along comes Richard Ramirez. The book is densely written in standard true crime format: a recounting of Ramirez' body of work, so to speak, followed by his capture, followed by his lengthy trial.Carlo can really write. He is reportorial, never falling to the level of the lesser writers who feel compelled to insert their opinions, marginally witty remarks, and snide asides into their books. Carlo simply researches exhaustively and reports expertly. His research into Ramirez' childhood and family background is nothing short of outstanding, as is his extensive examination of the \\"Ramirez groupie\\" phenomenon.In my mind, the only failing this book has is that part 3, the trial section, is perhaps 50 pages too long. For the most part, Carlo does fine work here as well, but there is sufficient repetition (he has cops testifying to their knowledge of specific crimes when he has provided identical information while describing the crimes in part 1) that portions of part 3 became somewhat tedious and skimmable. This is the reason I have rated the book 4 rather than 5 stars. But for the most part even part 3 is interesting and it is always professional.THE NIGHT STALKER is excellent true crime. One of my own personal tests of well written true crime is that when I am through reading, I am pleased that I have read the book and then realize that I was not aware of the author as a personality; that the author was strong and confident enough that he let his writing stand on its own and didn't feel the need to insert his personality or opinions into the text. Carlo has accomplished this in spades. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I really enjoyed this book because I felt it struck a good balance between the actual crimes (written as though we are riding along with the killer in gripping detail), the personal life and background of the Killer (so many books seem to leave out that serial killers are somebody's brother, son etc.), and the difficult and incredibly complex trial that follows (this was one of the longest and most intricate trials in all of CA history). I couldn't put it down. I am impressed with the amount of work that went into writing this book and it certainly seems to have paid off. Just like \\"The Only Living Witness\\" is one of the best books written on Bundy, I feel this is its equal in terms of Ramirez. Excellent, won't dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This may be an old case, but Ramirez is the ultimate archetype of evil. In some ways, this is the book that other true crime should be compared to. It's thorough, unrelentingly real, which is what makes this so scary. The structure, and detail make this a must read for true crime fans. It starts to feel long about three quarters in, but this is because Carlo doesn't miss anything. He doggedly persists in presenting every single incident in the case, from beginning to end. Only because it felt long, I gave this four stars. As with any classic, from In Cold Blood to my favorite new classic, Monster of Florence, or Drew Peterson Exposed, this belongs on every true crime fan's shelf."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I've read other \\"true crimes\\" books before, but The Night Stalker stands out above the crowd for the following reasons:1. It is actually quite well written, instead of slapped together.2. Carlo, the author, went beyond an account of a serial killer to explore the female groupies who are attracted to Richard Ramirez. I don't know who's sicker: Ramirez or these women, some of whom actually fantasize being raped by and, in at least one case, being raped while being murdered by Ramirez.3. At the end of the book, Carlo includes a fairly extensive interview he conducted with Ramirez.4. Lastly, but not the least, Carlo does not shy away from the Satanic aspect of Ramirez. I just wish in his interviews, he had asked Ramirez more probing questions on this subject, e.g., exactly why Ramirez was and remains attracted to Satan and actually relishes the thought of going to Hell."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This was the first book I have read about Richard Ramirez and I found it to be fabulously written. At I first I thought Carlo went into to much details about certain people that were pertaining to the hunt, Example the exact description of Gil Carrillo or of Frank Salerno. I had no interest in learning what weight there were or how tall these gentlemen are. I did enjoy though the progression of growth and experience these two received thru searching for the Night Stalker. There is a lot of information about Richard family, their lives, the relationship that they had with Richard and the true abilities and thoughts of the night stalker. When you are reading about the crimes ... you go deep into the details of the victims and what was suffered by them and of the loved one after their deaths. After Richard was sentenced some family member where able to speak on behalf of there lost loved one, and I found that to be a great part of the book. To hear what they were feeling after the death of their loved ones. The breakdown of the trial was wonderful written...Very informative!! I was quite young when Richard was sentenced in 1986 but I can remember bit and pieces of information which kept me interested and this book was a great find after so much time wonder what really went on. Phillip Carlo speaks a lot about the \\"fans\\" of Richard Ramirez and I was amazed about all of that. I never realize how intrigued Richard made women at that time. How women felt being near him or being able to actually speak to him. You can never really understand what is going on inside a person mind, but I think that Carlo explained Doreen to people very well. He took you into her life and her thoughts about Richard and his family. She fell in love with him and did what any women does for the man that she loves...she stood by him and on 10/03/96 they became Mr. and Mrs. Richard Munoz Ramirez.All in all I hope that you choose to read this book. I 100% enjoyed reading this book!! I think it was a wonderfully written book by Philip Carlo and I hope I have written my opinion good enough for you to want to read \\"The Night Stalker\\"..."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"A true crime treasure. This is one of the best true crime books out there. If you like true crime and criminal psychology, get it. If you scare easily - don't. This is the stuff that nightmares are made of."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Ok so... I love books on serial killers, the serial killers themselves fasciante me! So, I got this book to read up on Richard. There are pros and cons to it. The Pro is: It goes into detail about how he did each act. Which is great. Loved it. The cons: the bad thing was the book just dove right into him as an adult! There is no way of knowing how he got how he did.. It does not say anything about his childhood. I would think it would be more interesting knowing how he was as a child!But it doesnt. It just goes right into when hes an adult about to commit an act! I dont like that. It goes into detail about how he did each act, but its also focused on how they caught him, which detectives were investigating the crimes, how they talked about him and so on.. So for me, it was so, so .. Did not keep me on the edge of my seat like some books do on serail killers. Meh, was ok.. I would have liked it more if it had started from his childhood. Its more understanding to see what they do as a child. Its more clear. But it dives right into him as an adult about to commit an act.. So was ok.. nothing great for me..."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"True crime books are generally not known for their elegant prose, but this book is a major exception. The writing is atmospheric and descriptive without being pretentiously flowery. The author deftly shifts between simple narrative and psychobiographical description throughout. Ramirez himself is an incredibly compelling figure. Unlike other serial killers who generally seem to be psychopaths and kill as a compulsion, Ramirez knew he was a monster and thoroughly embraced the role. The extent to which he terrorized one of the largest and most proudly resolute populations in the world is a testament to his skill as essentially a professional murderer. One account in particular--his waking of a couple and boastful declaration of \\"Do you know who I am? I'm the Night Stalker!\\"--sends shivers down the spine. The interview with Ramirez at the end is beyond chilling; a surprisingly eloquent and thoughtful interview with evil incarnate. The descriptions of a handful of Ramirez \\"groupies\\" who are hopelessly drawn and in love with him is both bizarre and provocative.It's rather disconcerting to see that I have written such praise for a book that is essentially an account of unspeakably vicious and violent crimes, but one cannot help but be perversely compelled by Ramirez as portrayed in this work. If any historical narrative leaves one lying awake at night, pondering how such a figure could actually exist, it has done its job well. It is often said of sports successes that \\"if you made a movie about it, everybody would groan because it's so unbelievable\\". This cliche became stale several years ago, but after reading Carlo's book, one can't help but thinking that if a movie or book were written about an ostensibly fictional serial killer who committed such ruthless, violent, and horrible crimes but who also possessed movie star good looks but could also wax eloquently about philosophy and human nature, people would roll their eyes. Carlo's book is a powerful reminder that truth often really is stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"True crime book I've read thus far. I still have a lot to catch up on as I'm just now really getting into true crime books but this one by far takes the cake! It's INCREDIBLE and you get every single point of view you can think of and you don't have any questions when it's over because it answers them all. I just read online they're making it a movie and James Franco is to play Richard Ramirez I HOPE that they can really captivate all the details in this book and transfer them to the silver screen!!!!THIS BOOK WILL NOT FAIL YOU!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This was my first true crime book and I found it not only detailed and informative but fascinating as well. I could not put it down.....I read it in a week. Phillip Carlo is an amazing writer and his research on Richard Ramirez is very impressive. I very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The book has it's dry spots. One example being is the 2 or 3 chapter written on Richards parents, however I seen it as necessary in order to understand the psychological development of Ritchie. All in all Philip Carlo impressed me with his halfway objectiveness. After all, who isn't a little biased? Carlo isn't your typical Diane Fanning or Anne Rule. He lets you see that Richard was a child once, that he was a victim just like every one else. Honestly, the writers empathy made me tear up at times. I highly recommend this book to any one who wants to know more about Ramirez."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The author did a great job on the facts of the case and the descriptions of the murders. I am fascinated by Richard Ramirez and his life story. Especially the key events that led him to become a brutal murderer. I have a friend who remembers her parents locking every door and having a gun underneath their bed. I am happy I grew up on the east coast and never had to be scared to go to bed at night."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I remember reading this book years ago and I would get so scared at night if I heard just the slightest noise, that I would make my husband get up and check the house. Richard Ramirez is a monster in human form and it's scary to think there are so many others that roam this earth as well. It definitely made me be more aware of my surroundings and make sure my home is secure as can be."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I've always been interested in the rigorous work of homicide detectives, especially those who track down and eventually capture serial killers. Richard Ramirez's murder spree was taking place when I was a 10-year-old in California. After reading this book, and not knowing much about the crimes in particular, I realized just how close to home Ramirez's tracks were at that time.None of the true crime I've read compares to Carlo's \\"The Night Stalker\\".Carlo leaves no stone unturned as he tells the epic stories of Ramirez, the LA Homicide detectives, and the families who endured the crises. This appropriately comprehensive book gives the reader amazing insights into the processes that took place to bring Ramirez to justice; and for this reader, a humbling gratitude for police and the sacrifices they make to keep us all safe. Carlo also exposes Ramirez's life growing up in Texas, and then introduces us to the man who ended up in San Quentin on death row.If you're looking for a very educational, in-depth reading experience I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The Night Stalker (Richard Ramirez) made Ted Bundy look like a choir boy. Seriously. This guy's crimes were far worse than most serial killers. Only a few come to mind that can stack up against Ramirez in pure brutality and lack of consience. Ramirez, John Wayne Gacy, and Jeffery Dahlmer might be able to challenge for the title of Most Sick. Carlo goes through gut wrenching research to detail each victim during their final moments. This book will indeed make you cringe as Carlo let's (makes) you relive the moments of torture, rape, and assault. I hope the U.S. never sees another killer like Ramirez, but reading about him was fascinating. The backstory on his childhood and teenage years reveal how life's challenges, family and environment created this monster."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Well written book. Excellent! I could not put it down. I imagine his poor victims and the horror that they went through. He is truly a monster. He made me realize that evil is among us. He just did not care about anyone. So cruel!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book was very well written - factual, eloquent, thorough, detailed, objective. The writer takes you from beginning to end of this vicious, evil and heartrending account of a serial killer's trail. This book will give you goose bumps especially if you live in the LA basin, even now. It's a &quot;hit home hard&quot; story that will give you lumps in your throat at the obvious disregard this killer had for his victims. His allegiance to the devil incited my hunger to increase my awareness of and find out more about devil-worshipers and their love for Satan. It will make you check your doors and windows twice before going to bed at night."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN.

It was all about the allure of the Nightstalker. It was almost like he was outside your bedroom window it was like you was in the courtroom on the edge of your seat wanting to get a glimpse of the man. Fearing that he would get death row and being thankful that he was locked up. This book made you feel every move the pain of the victims family and that pain of Richards family.

I think that this author writes some nice pieces of written masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"With the possible exception of Helter Skelter, this is the best true crime book I have ever read. Carlo does an excellent job of telling the story of Richard Ramirez.By no means is Ramirez a conventional serial killer. First of all, he does not fit the stereotypical mold of a young white male. Because of his Hispanic heritage, had he been able to get to Mexico, he might be free to this day. His victims were not typical either, but very random. Perhaps what is most intriguing about this Satanist is his apparent control over the opposite sex. Women melt at the sight of his brown eyes, despite knowing he is a killer. This foreshadows the story of how he got married while in prison.While this book is not a popular true crime book, it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I love true crime, and this book was a special treat. All of us sickos out there will get our fix of horrific real-life events, and there's one particular courtroom accusation that will make anyone's eyes mist up. Some people don't like the quite detailed courtoom forensic stuff, but it brings to light the fact that it takes SO much evidence to get a guilty verdict even when someone is so obviously GUILTY. There are some gruesome pictures resulting from these crimes, but unfortunately, as it often is in the world of True Crime novels, they are not featured in the &quot;8 pages of shocking photos&quot; section. Over all, exellent modern True crime epic, you learn to love Ramirez."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"this book is the first true crime i read.i love it. i am 15 years old and i have a very hard time finishing books i start but this one kept my attetion. there are some boring parts like some of the court scence and stuff. i wish they talked more about the murders. I felt bad for the killer some times and other times i am like well he deserves everything the most touching part is about his childhood i felt really bad for him i think your opion of him will change when you read about his childhood. i feel really bad for him cause none of the good looking women are his admires haha. read the book it is really really great"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Seller was awesome in regards to how quickly I received the book... by the way I needed it for a research paper that was due within 2 weeks of receiving it and I got an A....

Merry Christmas"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"A friend of mine was recently at the book store and decided to pick up a few &quot;real crime&quot; books. One was on Ted Bundy, another on Charles Manson, and a third that happened to be a book on Richard Ramirez. He decided to read the Ted Bundy piece first, and offered &quot;The Night Stalker...&quot; to me.I never knew much about the crimes, other than my vague memories of laying awake at night as a child in my grandmother's Orange County home and praying the Night Stalker wouldn't choose my house to come to on any given night, and as such I decided to give the book a read through. From the first page I wasn't met with an ounce of disappointment.The compelling descriptions on the psyche of Richard Ramirez, as well as the in-depth descriptions of the murder scenes and the acts themselves seemed highly detailed and a quick read. In fact, I'm half asleep at my desk right now due to my inability to put the book down last night.Philip Carlo has written a compelling and interesting book on a subject that was all too close to me for my own comfort. I can only imagine the thoughts that went through his mind while going to the crime scenes and being face to face with the man deemed responsible for those atrocities. He has managed to capture it all within the pages of this book.If you're into this genre, it hasn't been done better. A must buy!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"With the exception of the Night Stalker himself, Philip Carlo is the foremost expert on Richard Ramirez and the Night Stalker case. Every television documentary I have seen on Ramirez's murderous rampage in southern California in 1985 includes interviews with Carlo and information coming directly from this book. Carlo provides one of the most thorough true crime works I have read. He has accumulated information from hundreds of interviews with the key people in Ramirez's life and the Night Stalker case, including hours with the Night Stalker, himself. Every thing is covered here: the gory details of the numerous rapes and murders, the exciting capture of Ramirez by an angry mob, the long and often infuriating trial, and Ramirez's Death Row wedding with an entertainment magazine editor. What I found to be the most interesting part of the book was the section on the Ramirez family, particularly young Richard's relationship with his cousin Mike.Mike was a decorated Green Beret who returned to the U.S. a mental and emotional volcano. He taught young Richard guerrilla combat techniques which ironically came in handy when Richard set out for a \\"career\\" in burglary that later escalated to much worse crimes. Mike also showed Richard photographs of Vietnamese women sexually tortured and killed. A crime Richard witnessed Mike committing while a visitor in his cousin's home was a turning point in Ramirez's life.The bizarre groupies who attended Ramirez's sometimes farcical trial is very eye-opening. I was shocked at the lengths to which some of these women went to visit Ramirez even after he was convicted for some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. That one of these groupies was a juror is even more remarkable (even Madonna wanted to meet him). This book is the best source on one of the most infamous serial killer cases of the century and, by true crime standards, well written. An index would have been a welcomed addition, but the book is divided in the following \\"books\\": \\"The Hunted and the Hunters,\\" \\"Richie,\\" \\"Capture,\\" \\"The Trial,\\" and \\"Epilogue.\\""},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Phillip Carlo did lots of research and was very patient in producing this thorough and complete book examining the Night Stalker. Modus Operandi, descriptions of the LA area, and the fear caused by this sick person were detailed. The honestly gruesome details of what Ramirez did to his victims were covered. If there is evil on this Earth Ramirez fits the bill. This is a very good book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This was my first true crime novel I had ever attempted to read, and my foray into this subject was a success. I am a psychology major, and I wrote a term paper on Mr. Ramirez with the help of this novel as one of my sources. This nonfiction work reads likes fiction in that it is so descriptive and jarring it almost seems like you are entering a sadistic universe that doesn't exist, although in the mind of Richard it actually does. A sadist to the tenth degree as well as a religiously obsessed genius, Richard is a man who one feels sympathy for if only for the fact that if it were not for his uncontrollable psychosis he could have actually been a wonderful asset to society with his unexpected wit and high intelligence. Read this man's quotes, ponder his wonderful speech given in court, and you will realize this is no \\"average joe\\" killer. This is an intelligent, sadistic, individual who is at war with the philosophical demons he posseses and the incredible beauty, talent, and genius he holds deep inside."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"What is it that makes a serial killer tick? And what exactly is it that makes the public fascinated with them while fearful of them? Richard Ramirez, infamously known as the Night Stalker, is in a breed of his own. One of the most dangerous and feared serial killers in America, Ramirez and his crimes still haunt the public mind today as his murderous spree did in the mid-1980s. Philip Carlo's book about Ramirez's life and crimes is extremely thorough and well-written, a quick-paced nightmare of a read.Richard Ramirez became known as the Night Stalker because his crimes occured at night; he would sneak into his victims' houses while they were sleeping and attack them. His rampages were never quite the same, making him an unusual serial killer who didn't always follow the same MO, but ensuring that he was all the more difficult to track because investigators wouldn't tie his crimes together. Except for homicide detectives Gil Carrillo and Frank Salerno (of Hillside Strangler fame) who were convinced that the variety of crimes committed in quiet L.A. neighborhoods were the work of one man. Their task force was responsible for finding evidence to link these crimes and capture the man resopnsible for the string of robberies, rapes, murders, and attempted murders.Carlo's book is divided neatly into different sections, creating suspense for the reader as he begins with vivid recreations of the Night Stalker crimes, then springboards into Ramirez's youth and finally into his capture and trial. Ramirez's crimes terrorized the Los Angeles area, but also mesmerized legions of people. A known Satanist, Ramirez instilled fear in not only his victims, but many who came in contact with him. For others, especially young women (including a juror), he was a beautiful, dangerous man they wanted to embrace and fight for, beliving him innocent of the crimes. \\"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez\\" is a spellbinding book that weaves a complete picture of Richard Ramirez and recreates an unbiased look at his capture and trial and the mystery that surrounds him still."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book takes you through, in great detail, every crime Richard Ramirez committed, the investigation,search, and capture of the Nightstalker. His rampage that left more than a dozen people dead and HURT. From there, it details his trial and his experiences in prison/death row. Mr. Carlo leaves no stone unturned in this book. This book is REAL hard to put down.If you are looking for information on this case, get this one FIRST!!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"When I first read this book, I thought it would just be another true crime book. But soon after starting this book, I realized I was in for a ride! It was tough to lay in my bedroom at night time and read this book. Every little noise, crack and creak in my house had me listening very closely and holding my breathe.For sure, this book is the reason I always double check my locks and windows at night time. The way he was able to break into homes at night time and be completely undetected was amazing. You would think you or your dog would hear when a window is being opened. Unfortunately, this book shows you how you are not safe in your home at night time. Gives me chills thinking about it and it has been a few years since I read it. I most likely will never read this book again due to the nightmares I experienced from it the first time around.So if your thinking of reading this book, turn the lights on while someone else is home with you or just read it during the day."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book is one of the few True Crime books I've read that talked more about the crime, and less about the trial. I enjoyed the way it described the movements Richard Ramirez took with every murder & his childhood. I am not interested on every detail of the trail or how the trees swayed in the breeze. I like more information on how the crime was acted out. For instance, when it talks about events Richard did before and after each break-in. Also it goes in great detail about his childhood so the reader has some idea of where he was coming from with each kill. If you are someone who likes more crime & less trial than this is an excellent book to get."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"If one wants to seriously get into the mind of a serial killer this is a must have best buy. Phillip Carlo presents facinating background with this piece. It isn't often a writer can take me there so I'm scared to turn off the light but this book did it. The book reads like a novel, I couldn't put it down, and was sad to discover there weren't about 10 more from the author I could purchase. Richard Ramirez is captured so expertly you'll think you know him by the last page. Did you like \\"In Cold Blood'? Then you must read \\"The Night Stalker\\""},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"As a lover of true-crime writing, this book is one of the best. The first half of the book takes you through his crimes and the second half takes you through his ultimate conviction.I thought I was hardened to crime novels, but I lost many a night of sleep due to this book. I credit this book with teaching me to lock my windows at night.My mate is not an avid reader, and even he could NOT put this book down. It's a guilty pleasure ... you will question whether it is a good idea to put these images in your mind.This is a must-read for any true crime enthusiast.Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Richard Ramirez was different in a lot of ways from 'normal' serial killers in that his victims were not stalked (despite his nickname), not obsessed over, and they did not fit one profile or gender. They were random innocents who never dreamed they'd be so unlucky. Philip Carlo effectively makes us care about the victims instead of treating them as arbitrarily as Ramirez did, although I have to confess I started to lose track of them as the murders piled up. But that serves well to remind the reader of the enormous amount of life that was taken by the Night Stalker. If Ramirez's crimes were a freak show, his trial was a circus. Carlo's work on the trial is as thorough as I've seen such a thing presented, for better or worse. Fully half of the near-600 page book is steeped in court proceedings, so you've been warned. Through no fault of the author's, it slows to a crawl in places. Every motion, hearing, and decision is slavishly detailed. During the trial, Ramirez gained a legion of faithful admirers (mostly women) who followed his every move. Carlo lets them explain why they are so drawn to him, without making value judgments. Do they realize he could have raped or killed them? Of course, some wish he had... I would like to read a book on why so many women are attracted to famous killers; there's probably at least a few out there. Richard Ramirez is an example of a life gone wrong. The book based on his life makes him all the more unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I am a slow reader but couldn't put the book down until I had read it to the end, and it didn't take me long. The part that didn't really hold my interest was the section \\"The Trial\\". Other than that it was a very good book. After reading a couple of chapters I went through my house and locked every window and all the doors. A very frightening book especially for one who lives alone. I have passed the book on to a friend that loves true crime."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Richard Ramirez is, in my opinion, the most harrowing serial killer in American history, and maybe of all time. What made his heinous crimes so chilling was the methodical and totally arbitrary way in which he picked his victims. You didn't have to fit a specific profile for Ramirez to want to kill you -- you simply had to be sleeping in your house on the night he happened by. He was -- and still is, I imagine -- the very definition of evil ... a thoroughly ignominious \\"honor\\" to which he proudly confesses. This book does a great, albeit excruciatingly sad and frighteningly vivid job of recounting Ramirez's terrifying exploits."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Philip Carlo's book is well-researched and very thorough. We know more about the Night Stalker also known as Richard Ramirez who terrorized Los Angeles area and San Francisco in 1985 and 1984. He is a self-admitted Satanist who got his kicks and highs from terrorizing even the most vulnerable of victims. He raped, sodomized, tortured, and terrorized not only women but the entire Southern California area lived in fear--changing their locks, getting guns, dogs, etc. anything to make themselves feel safer. They hadn't seen a crime like this since Manson but Ramirez was a one man crime spree who worshipped Satan. His family history provides a better understanding of the man's background and the incidents as well provides some insight into why he became such a terror. To this day, what surprises me is the most is that women fell for him as if he was a desirable catch. One fan even married him in prison while he is on death row which means life in California. The proceedings because Ramirez refused anybody but a Hispanic lawyer to represent him may have hurt his chances. I don't care what race or ethnicity or religion regarding an attorney. The best defense attorneys cost money and they do defend regardless of whether they are Jewish like Robert Shapiro or African American like Johnnie Cochrane. His lawyers were inept to handle the magnitude of such an enormous case and they didn't have the expertise or experience to know how to handle Ramirez's defense. Of course, Ramirez' crimes are just unthinkable and unforgivable especially how he went after mature women in their sixties and eighties. Even though he's on death row, he still gets to get married to one of his fans. He's not that attractive and he's not that nice. There is a diabolical side to him. I think the Satanism, the crimes, and the brutality is enough to disuade any women from being attractive to a man like that knowing what he has done without much remorse or apologies to his family, friends, and others."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I wanted to read about this man called Richard Ramirez who I had read and heard a little about. I found it interesting that this good-looking man had done so many horrible things. I hadn't known exactly what he did but I soon found out thanks to this book. I was immersed into the life of this man. I actually felt that everything that was happening in the book was happening in real time.I don't ever really get to the end of any books, but this one intrigued me. I felt that I knew him due to the fact that Philip Carlo documented important aspects of this man's life, some parts Ramirez himself may not remember. I feel like I have an understanding of why he is who he is, why he became who he is.If you really want to know this man, know what he did, and form an opinion of your own, read this book. It allows you to see just how perverted the human mind can become. Richard Ramirez is still so fascinating to me that even though I read this book 3/4 yrs ago, today I am still looking him up on the net, and still trying to keep up with what's going on with him. My verdict: knowing about this man made me realize that once you just easily release your inhibitions, that nothing's on your conscience, nothing's wrong or right and anything can be done with the snap of a finger. It's that easy, and its that scary.One final thing - listen to AC/DC's \\"Night Prowler\\" - I can understand it contributing to Ramirez's adrenaline flow just before he stepped into someone's house and changed their lives."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The Night Stalker is one of the best true crime books that I have read. Philip Carlo gives the reader well researched details of Richard Ramirez's crimes as well as his life, describing what events led up to and may have caused him to commit the violent crimes that he did. His family and their daily struggles are also described as they try to support a family member, who is also a serial killer, while trying to cope with what he has done. The Night Stalker is a must read for every true crime reader!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"The Night Stalker is one of the most interesting books I have read, alone with Stranger beside me, is one of my favorites, I am planning to read it one more time. I really recommend it to all true crime fans. You cannot let it go! Richard Ramirez was one of the most brutal serial killers that had lived."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Before I begin, let me inform you that I am not one of those people who jump on true crime writers for glorifying crime because they give detailed descriptions of what happened. I don't think I've ever thought to make that complaint before reading this book.First of all, the author makes the crimes seem pretty cool. It's as if he's writing a screenplay for the next big slasher picture. He makes Ramirez sound like an unstoppable murder machine, a Mexican Michael Myers. He never tires of telling us about Ramirez' catlike agility or wiry strength. All of this stuff comes off as somewhat juvenile and ham-fisted to this reader, but Carlo goes on and on about it ad infinitum. He loves to repeat himself. You don't even have to be an observant reader to pick up on it. He literally repeats himself without bothering to use synonyms or even to put the words in a slightly different order.The worst thing of all is that he omits crimes that are unflattering to Ramirez. He raped several children under the age of 10. Ramirez sodomized a male child during one of the crimes that Carlo does report on, but he curiously omits that part. This shows a complete lack of journalistic integrity and, in my view, it's downright unethical.If you want insights into the mind of a serial killer, I recommend looking elsewhere. You don't learn anything about what makes Ricard Ramirez tick or how his mind works. The author interviews Ramirez at the end of the book, but don't get your hopes up. Ramirez likes to speak in a vague, pedantic, narcissistic, and abstract manner which is clearly intended to make him seem deep and intelligent, but it fails miserably because he is neither of those things. Carlo allows him to ramble endlessly without saying anything. He never tries to pressure him. It's like a casual chat and as a result, no interesting information is elicited. You won't come away from this book knowing much about RR's personality. He likes Satan and being evil, but I could have guessed that already. Carlo is never able to penetrate his shell and get to the person behind the persona (I'm not suggesting there's a whole lot there in Richard's case, but we get nothing whatsoever). If you want to read a book that does give you such insights, try \\"The Sadist\\" by Karl Berg, which is about Peter K&uuml;rten, and \\"The Only Living Witness\\" by Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth about Ted Bundy.The good thing about this book is that it's written like a serial killer thriller that you'd find in the book section of your local grocery store. Well, perhaps that's not quite correct. Books by Thomas Harris and James Patterson have a smoother, significantly more articulate writing style, they don't repeat themselves verbatim, and they're nowhere near this lurid. This is like a particularly nasty story that you'd read in a detective magazine. It's entertaining if you like that sort of thing and I have to admit that I do. I would have given it another star if the post-arrest portion of the book wasn't so long and boring. Some reviewers defend its length and tedium by saying that it's necessary to include in a thorough, complete biography of RR. I'd be more likely to buy that argument if this book tried to be authoritative and comprehensive, but instead it's grisly pop sensationalism that knows you can't make a child rapist into an anti-hero, which is how it wants to portray RR. I.e., this book is not trying to maintain the the highest standards of journalistic integrity, so omitting a few boring details should be ok."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This is one of the best true crime stories I've ever read. The book opens with each crime recounted from Ramirez's point of view - and if you lived in L.A. during this time the first several chapters will bring back quite a few memories. Then the author traces Ramirez from birth to adulthood. This part of the book was excellent - few &quot;serial killer&quot; books are able to offer any insight into what may have shaped the killer early on. Finally, the trial is covered. These last few chapters were tedious at times, but I think that helped drive home the point of just how ridiculous our justice system can be. I couldn't put it down and didn't sleep well the whole time I was reading it - exactly what should happen when one is looking for a scary and enthralling read!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"If you just want a recitation of crimes and facts, then this book will probably satisfy you. But if you want analysis and insight, you're out of luck here. If you expect continuity, good grammar, and proper spelling -- in other words, basic good writing -- you'll be even more disappointed. Shame on the editor who let this mess get into print."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I had become very interrested in Richard as I grew up in California and lived there durring the time these crimes happened and was all scared all over California so I had to know why. I also felt compelled to know him, to know why, and to understand why. After reading this book, though I felt the author had him already guilty from the beginning of the book. He tells about all the horrible crimes as he says Richard explains them to him, then goe's into the family history, they the capture and court preceedings. I thought in the US one was innocent until proven guilty. It's not what happened here all though there is overwhelming evidence here, the fact remains, that this man's rights were violated.......... The author had to be in it for the money, otherwise he would've started from the life of the Ramirez family or the court proceedings then the life and then the crimes he claims Richard confessed to him. Another great injustice in our so called freedom of the USA."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the life of Richard Ramirez. Everything from his childhood to his capture is perfectly documented and analyzed. I just knew the basic facts about Ramirez before reading this book. From El Paso, opperated in L.A, broke into houses and murdered his victims in their sleep. This book gave me a much deeper insight into his story by providing me with family member testimonies, survior testimonies and trial procedings.All of his crimes are explained by dates, times, locations and methods. The most disturbing thing that I discovered from my readings, was his seemingly hypnotic hold on women. It amazes me that a cold blooded murder and convicted rapist would have a waiting list a mile long of women willing to do anything for him. He is one of, if not THE most chilling killers I have ever studied (Bundy and Dahmer are up there) After I finished this book I began locking my door and checking the windows every night. I still do to this day. If you read this book you'll understand why."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Carlo did a great job of telling about Rameriz's actual crimes. He made it seem as real as possible and actually made me cry! The only part I was bored with was when he was getting into the court trial, but that is because I am more interested in what he did. I am not a courtroom person, so I am not interested in that section of the story. I was very pleased with the detail of his actions. The psychology behind the criminal mind is what I am interested in. I think a true crime buff would really enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"It took me weeks to finish this book. Not because it was bad, but because it was so good. The horror this maniac committed scared me so much, that I had to put the book down a few times. If you like a good story and like to be scared, this book is for you. Knowing its a true story as I was reading made it even more horrifying. My heart goes out to all of his victims. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I read a lot about true crime, as it is a career avenue I'd like to pursue. As someone who has read a lot of material regarding serial killers and mass murders, as well as many other books based on fiction or fact of other topics (I read a lot of John Douglas' work, which I highly recommend), I can honestly say that this book held my attention with both the information Philip Carlo obviously put a lot of time into researching, and his amazing descriptive ability. This read like a fiction. He tends to overuse words at times, but that is merely a small issue. This book is captivating and spell-binding, and the detail that has been put into it will definity satisfy the reader. It is human nature to be curious about the sick and twisted deeds of killers like Ramirez, and at the risk of sounding unsympathetic towards his victims, this book does not disappoint. Although it saddens me to read about such violence to innocent people, I want to know the truth, what the crime scene was like, and how the murder was carried out. It gives me a lot of insight into how these criminal master-minds think, and enables me to delve deeper into their psyche patterns."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This is one of the few books I couldn't finish. The book starts off really strong for the first 100 pages or so. You get to read a detailed, journalistic account of Ramirez' crime spree, and some interesting information about his youth as well. But about halfway through, the novel transforms into one of the most boring courtroom &quot;dramas&quot; you will ever read. Carlo details all of the legal maneuvering, but Ramirez is so blatantly guilty that it is all rather pointless. And considering how the lawyers that strive to defend him are so shallow and fame-seeking, and the groupies that adore him so nasty and mindless, Ramirez almost seems like the most respectable person in the book. More detail about the crimes and less of the courtroom would have made this a far better book. Ramirez is only an interesting character because of his sociopathic tendencies. What happens after his capture can only be trivial and dull by comparison."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"As sleazy, trashy, sensationalized and exploitive as they tend to be I still have a weakness for true crime books. What Ramirez did was very disturbing and out and out evil. He did things like stab old ladies while they were sleeping and rape invalids. Almost equally as disturbing is this guy had female groupies fighting over him, including a juror, and Church of Satan nerds fawning over him and visiting him in prison.In this book the author put it together by doing interviews with Ramirez, the Ramirez family, detectives involved in the case and other people connected to the case in one way or another so I think its pretty credible as far as what actually went down compared to a lot of other true crime books I have read."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"As I am concerned about justice in America, especially in regard to homicide and serial killers, I found Philip Carlo's book completely fascinating in its depth and broad perspective. There were no cardboardcharacters in this book; there were only real, human, feeling, people; people who prayed and cried and despaired. Obviously Carlo researchedthis story thoroughly. What drama! We hear on TV, or read in the newspapers, that the victim was taken to the hospital and is expected tosurvive. But that's not where it ends. Victim Virginia Petersen tellswhat happens afterward in her statement when she was given a chance to speak after the sentencing. If you're the type who cries, you weep asyou learn of her family's agonies and the devastation and shamblesand fragmented pieces left of their lives after the attack. Then again,some object to giving a killer's family any sympathy. But when Carlotold of the family's deep grief, especially of his mother's and father'sdespair over his terrible murders, I felt, these, too, were victims.This is a book that helps men and women understand the serial killerand perhaps edge toward learning how to better handle such horrors when they arise."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I've read some complaints here about the fact that this book is too long because the author covers the trial of Richard Ramirez at great length in the second half of this novel. (The first half covers the crimes and the Night Stalker's childhood.) I'll have to disagree with those reviews. Author Philip Carlo is clearly well-researched. He provides a lot of input here not only into the crimes, victims, and the killer. We get to know the key players of this harrowing story of one of the most dangerous and scariest serial killers of the annals of crime. I highly recommend this gripping book. You'll find it hard to put down and even harder to forget."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Philip Carlo has written a very exhaustive book about the Night Stalker. It's hard to imagine a more complete book on the serial killer.The first portion of the book dealt with the horrible crimes of the Night Stalker.Following that was a section dealing with Richard Ramirez from birth all the way to his arrival in L.A. from El Paso. His temporal lobe epilepsy of childhood and the influence his cousin Miguel had on Ramirez when he was a pre-teen.The next section of the book was about his attempts to avoid arrest and his eventual apprehension by citizens.The last part gave a detailed summary of Ramirez's trial.What made the Night Stalker so dangerous was that he was a different breed of serial killer, he didn't victimize a certain type of person. He really didn't stalk his victims, he chose his targets at random from an ever-expanding area.Philip Carlo effectively connected the combinations of influences that fueled Ramirez's criminal drive;sex,drugs,pornography,heavy metal music,and satanism.He was a dedicated satanist reading books authored by Anton LaVey and even meeting him once.The strange,surreal actions by the Night Stalker \\"groupies\\" and Ramirez himself are reminiscent of the Charles Manson trial from \\"Helter Skelter\\".If you want to learn why the Night Stalker was arguably the most feared killer this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I'll begin with a few words about the author, because it's noteworthy. Philip Carlo is a man who strongly believes in research, and by that, I mean extremely thorough research. He spent over 100 hours with Richard Ramirez, and I cannot imagine how much more he spent studying the case. Carlo also is a man much concerned about the evil in this world and shows tremendous courage in his quest to understand and prevent these terrible things.The book itself is one enormous piece, about 600 tight pages, and I can't think of anything that is not covered by it. The structure of it is quite interesting as well: you first begin by the crimes commited by Ramirez, and believe me that part is seriously affecting (I am quite used to true crime books involving atrocious acts, but I had never felt so repulsed and shocked), then you move backwards in time to learn about Richard Ramirez's origins and family and life up to when he began murdering people. Then there's the capture, and the final parts are about the trial; probably the most thorough trial prose I've ever read in a true crime book. The quality of Carlo's work is truly outstanding.In this edition, there's a new chapter containing an interview with Richard Ramirez and some excerpts about females fans of Richard which just about blow one's mind with disturbing revelations about the woman psyche. It is extremely interesting.I would conclude by saying that if you are curious about Ramirez's case, then this is definitely the book for you, and I cannot imagine that another book covered so much material, with so much insight, as this one. With this book, you have an author who has a strong personality and is driven; and also one who definitely can write with excellence and leave himself out of judgement, however hard that is to do, he did it very professionally. This is one of the most impressive true crime books I ever read. The only other book that is similar in quality, I think, is Richard Lourie's book about Andrei Chikatilo. A must read."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book will tell you all you want to know and more about \\"The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez.\\" Vivid detail is provided regarding the individuals whose lives were abused and lost due to the twisted personality of Richard Ramirez. Richard's childhood is well explored, and one of his cousins named Mike provided Richard with a horrible role model to emulate. Mike was a Vietnam veteran who taught Richard the use of drugs and how to go about stealing and disabling those who may thwart your efforts. Once Richard's face was plastered in every newspaper it was just a matter of time before he was recognized somewhere on the street. He tried to steal one car too many, and this roused the neighborhood citizens to bring him down. The book goes into a lengthy detail on the trial and conviction of Richard. This part of the book can be both tedious and educational depending on your interest in courtroom drama. Richard continues to have several female admirers, some willing to dedicate their lives to him including one of the jurors who found him guilty. These women appear to have too much time on their hands. They obviously forget that had Richard invaded their home they would have been raped and probably murdered. Nevertheless, they find a morbid fascination with him, and refuse to recognize he is simply using their infatuation (they believe it is love) for him. If you enjoy true crime books I'm sure this one will hold your interest."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"\\"The Night Stalker\\" is the crawling tale of Richard Ramirez. RR was the serial killer/rapist/robber who terrorized several communities in and around Los Angeles in 1984-85. The horrid activities reported herein have been painstakingly researched and very directly presented by author Carlo. So much gruesome detail is included that Carlo must have had Ramirez' cooperation. The author certainly captures the mood and personality of the man. Carlo also takes pain to trace the killer's family background and El Paso, TX roots. His loyal family stood with RR throughout his prosecution and trial. Carlo certainly maintains a personal touch here- RR is allowed to tell his story. If NS has weakness, it lies in the excessive ink and space allotted to the prosecution and trial. This may be due to the stark fact that, killer though he was, RR's lawyers did not present a vigorous defense. Part of the blame for that lies with Ramirez himself. That point is made but still a stern editor could have blue penciled portions of the text. This reviewer has frequently mentioned the \\"Ann Rule\\" concerning centerfold photos. In NS, those are not of the typical true crime array: There are no pictures of any prosecutors, detectives or cops. Yet there are several of RR's family, defense team and female admirers. \\"The Night Stalker\\" is definitely recommended to true crime fans, especially those in LA land. A star is deducted for the aforementioned length. This reviewer read the 16th printing of NS. One suspects there may be moreto follow since RR is planning appeals based upon inadequacy of counsel. Imagine if there were a retrial with a different outcome! The tale of the Night Stalker may be with us for a while."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. Everything was so intense and it felt so real. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read true crime because it was the greatest. How can someone that looks quiet and seems to be the nicest person turn out to be a serial killer and with those great looks of his. Buy this book now!!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best True Crimes I have read in a really long time. Phillip Carlo does an excellent job in taking you through each crime scene and even into Richard's head. Most books about serial killers/True Crime, make you see the serial killer as nothing more than a monster with no explanation of why or what caused them to do the crimes they do. While this book doesnt give scientific evidence of what caused Richard to become a serial killer, it does give a lot of background information into his childhood and family dynamics. It's hard to see people who committ such gruesome crimes as a loving child, and once a caring person, but Phillip does a great job in capturing that, as hard as that may be. Richards crimes were and still are horrible. You cant help but think of his victims and their last moments as they struggled just to stay alive. This book has made me go a little OCD when it comes to locking my doors and windows. I would read this book again when I have down time. And I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"I would like to start off by saying that I do not condone the crimes that were described in this book. BUT I will say that this book is a must read for anyone who is a true crime buff or anyone thinking about doing drugs or entering the mental health field. This book clearly shows how low drugs,alcohol,porno, and lack of education can do to someone. Still referred as \\"RICKY\\" by his family, he is the youngest of five children. After reading this book, I would say that the \\"victims\\" who suffered the most were his own family---a poor Catholic Hispanic family in Texas.The book describes in stunning detail the crimes, crime scenes, the victims,the trial, and RR's family and himself. It is difficult to put down once you get started. The author visited each place and person including RR in order to write this book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Carlo did an excellent job capturing Ramirez's thoughts during his rampage of hate and violence.

Great job Carlo!!!"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book was definitely one of the better true crime books I have read. Truly horrifying and very well written. I however don't understand how readers can cry for this monster who deserved a punishment like what he inflicted on his helpless victims. I can't understand how readers cried for him. I have the feeling if he weren't an attractive man there would be no tears. A great, throught provoking book."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"This book will grip you from beginning to end. Definitedly a quick read. The author has written in a way that makes you feel like you actually know the killer and his victims. You will find yourself becoming (unbelievably) emotional about the killer. At times you want to hate him, then in the next page you find yourself feeling so sorry for this poor guy that you just want to cry for him -- which I did several times. I especially enjoyed reading this book because it didn't get hung up in hundreds of pages of technical jargon that's hard to follow like a lot of true crime books out there -- it reads like a spine tingling novel -- hard to believe it's all real!! You have got to read this book! I now find myself wondering what happened to Richard and what he's doing today -- it really grips you that tightly! WOW"},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Author Philip Carlo gives me an indept look at the life of one the most feared persons who lived in our mists.

The court room account was accurate and precisely done. I cant wait for the movie."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez","review":"Mr. Carlo has written a spectacular work here. It is so scary and absolutely not for everyone. I am one of those people who love being scared so I loved this book. As one reads the first part of the book, one cannot help thinking that Ramirez is in fact the devil. Carlo also discusses his boyhood, adolescence, capture, and trial. I found this stuff fascinating but I never felt any sympathy for Ramirez. I just became more and more scared as I read on. It was scary to shut the light off at night. It reads like a horror/thriller novel but it is true. And that is the most scary part."},{"Title":"Qualitative Data Analysis","review":"I read this book as part of an advanced qualitative research methods course. I enjoyed this book especially at the beginning, but by the end Dey's ideas and writing becomes redundant and tedious to read. I found I had to read past the \\"humor\\" examples Dey uses as his data and apply the ideas to my own research projects/data. It wasn't hard to do, though, so I think others can do the same and enjoy the ideas in this book as much.

This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the reviewPerhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights. Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level, like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.\\"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\\" is a prime example of the contradiction that a radical commentator is placed in. The themes of duplicity, latent homosexuality, adultery and dysfunctional families topped off by more than enough mendacity to sink a ship are the stuff of social drama that NEED to be addressed as outcomes in the modern capitalist cultural sphere. However, in the end nothing really gets resolved truthfully here. Old 1950's-style All-American boy Brick, the \`great white hope' of the family, may or may not sober up after the \`lost' of his dear friend and fellow football player, Skipper. Saucy and sexy wife Maggie (the cat) may or may not really get pregnant by Brick and save the family heritage for him, or die trying. The only certainty, despite all that above-mentioned mendacity, is that Big Daddy is going to die and that 28,000 acres of the finest land in the Delta is going to need new management, either Brick, brother Goober (along with his scheming wife and their \`lovely brood' of children) or some upstart. Off of these possible outcomes, however, I would not get too worked up about the final outcome."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"I think that part of the play should have taken place out doors.

In this book set on a Southern Plantation we have the obligatory hysterical woman, an alcoholic and a homophobe.

I missed the action and hearing what people look like, and later I grew tired wondering what people were doing. I feel Amazon should make it clear that not all their books are books, but some are, in fact, plays.However, I am giving it five stars, as the cover had a sunny, retro, jazzy feel."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"At least this time, Tennessee Williams finally write a much more polished play with a lot of details. Once again, just like in The Glass Menagerie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof involves a lot of screaming, airy Southern talking, and weak and useless characters. I couldn't find a point in the play, and there is no moral to speak of unless it aims to convert a moneybag grubber into a Christian saint. The pages just keep going on and on with the same reaction from the characters, especially Big Daddy. In fact, who the heck calls themselves Big Daddy and Big Mama? Surely, they must be out of their minds to allow them. If Big Daddy doesn't like the way things are, then why can't he just either go on with the divorce and put everybody in exile or shut up? Brick is a useless ex-football player who seems to be content about killing himself. Maggie is a gold-digger. Gooper, Mae, and their kids...who cares about them? All in all, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is another waste of a play penned by Tennessee Williams because like in the previous two famous plays, it's the same theme with no resolution."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Pointless, with annoying characters. The one character I did like, Maggie, was completely WASTED! Williams did nothing with her, which was a sin since she's a great character. Read A streetcar named desire if you want a good play by williams."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Ok, so it is an American Classic. None-the-less, it is still a story about a family of mean, miserable people. If you like that kinda think then read it. Williams has some great dialogue & vivid characters. Still, can there be at least one good person in the story??"},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Tennessee Williams's Pulitzer Prize winning play &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; is a reverie filled drama of lust, greed, and death that puts emphasis on the interaction of families. Williams creates universal characters that are pathetic yet familiar and therefore warrant the reader's sympathy. He writes with such deceptive simplicity that he masks his characters's inner turmoil initially, making the turnout of such characterizations intriguing. The play presents that humanity isn't beautiful while attempting to shed light on the emotional lies that govern the interaction of families. &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;'s intertwining themes of the lie of life and the deception of death provide the reader with insight towards the amblivalence of life.To say so much within such a short piece is a mystery within itself. The sheer power of the plot is testimony of Williams's genius. The play is beautifully constructed and hits upon many themes and emotions with clarity and precision, making it an enjoyable read while having substance. I did an analysis of this book for my junior Reading class, and recommend the read to anyone seeking high drama and a well rounded take on death."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"This is a superbly written play about that most basic of human issues, the desire to communicate honestly and openly with someone that you care about. At its core, Tennessee Williams' masterpiece is really about nothing more than that. Everyone wants and needs someone to listen to, and accept, you.All of Williams' plays are about lonely people when you come right down to it. However, \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" is unique in that these lonely characters are part of a large family, and at times are literally tripping over each other. What makes us lonely is our inability to communicate with those that we love. It is in that essential human drive that Williams creates the tragedy of this piece. A father knows his son is a closeted gay man; he loves him, but can't get the son to believe or accept that. A wife knows the truth about her husband, but can't make herself believe it. (Actually that last one applies to two wives in the play, for different reasons.) A man faces death, in essence alone, because he can't admit how terrified he is. And the list goes on. These are the stories of the Pollitt family of the Mississippi Delta. Those particulars are different for all of us, but the essential worries and fears of the members of this family are universal, and have been at the heart of a powerful drama for over 50 years.The witting of this play is luminous and gorgeous. In fact, at times it reads like poetry. However, the power in this piece is also due in large part to the structure of this three act play. The first act is almost a solo from the character of Maggie. The second act is a painful and terrifying duet from the characters of Brick and Big Daddy, and the final act is the ensemble number that builds, and then ends on a slow drawn out note.If you see \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" in performance it is a long play, and at times painful. You will not feel the same intensity unless you let yourself sit down and devour it in one gulp. Read the play in a day, and you will come closer to approximating seeing it in performance than you otherwise would. In the best of possible worlds, you will read it, and then a month or so later see it in a well done performance.This play is the pinnacle of American Drama. You should know it. Make that the case if it is not so!"},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"&quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; is another masterpiece by Tennessee Williams, who was truly one of the 20th century's greatest playwrights. This play was presented in New York in the 1950s, and in book form it is an excellent read.I haven't looked at other editions, but the Signet edition contains two different versions of Act 3, along with a note by Williams explaining how director Elia Kazan persuaded him to write a second version. This feature makes the book particularly useful for teachers and students.&quot;Cat&quot; takes place on a Southern plantation, and deals with a wealthy, but very dysfunctional family. Williams creates stunning dialogue for his characters: Brick, the bitter, alcoholic ex-athlete; Brick's frustrated wife Margaret; &quot;Big Daddy,&quot; the patriarch, who is dying of cancer; and the rest. Williams also establishes the plantation's original owners as a haunting presence through the lines of his characters.&quot;Cat&quot; is an explosive family drama about greed, secrets, guilt, alcoholism, and sexual frustration. Williams' characters are larger-than-life, and even grotesque, but Williams never loses a grasp on their essential humanity. An important book for those with a serious interest in American drama."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof swelters with the fire of longing for that wispy shade of happiness. The fierce currents of discontent, jealousy, and mendacity surge through this piece, leaving the reader to fend for himself on an emotional and gripping roller coaster. The struggle between Maggie the Cat and her husband Brick is the universal struggle to love and be loved through the deceptions and misconceptions that can wreck a chance at happiness. The external struggles mirror the internal struggles, for each character seems to be battling despair and a sense of worthlessness. All in all a superb read."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"When I read this play, I was a little shocked; nothing I had read about this play prepared me for what I was about to read. What startled me the most is its bluntness. But after reflecting, I decided it is a well-written play and it wouldn't have the same effect if it were written any other way. \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" covers a lot of territory in just 173 pages. Homosexuality, alcoholism, dealing with problems, death, and relationships between husband and wife, family, and friends are just a few to mention. Each is covered in depth, but use few words to describe it. Tennessee Williams never states the facts; he leaves it to us to figure out what the characters are saying and the meaning behind it. With just six main characters, Williams discretely has them deal with their problems in their own way, by facing the facts, ignoring the problem, denial, or drinking the problem away. Williams paints a clear picture of each character's physical features, but more significant, personality and beliefs. It is interesting to see how the themes in \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" are viewed in today's society compared to when the play was first produced in 1955, nearly fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is Tennessee William's highly-acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize-winning play that stands on equal footing with the best American dramas ever written. While uniquely American, it is also inherently universal. Set in the American South, Williams plays out a kind of Southern King Lear. The drama that plays out is, in its details, distinctly Southern, but the implications and the deeper themes of the story reverberate in the hearts and minds of anyone who has ever been in the midst of a family struggle. A dialogue-only play that features no narration, Cat is quite a unique play for two different reasons. First, it takes place entirely in real time, with no lapses between scenes or acts -- thereby adhering to the Aristotelian unity of time and place, something that isn't seen much in post-classical drama. Also, it maintains a very high level of emotional content throughout the entire play. It starts out quickly, soon reaches a fever pitch, and never lets up. To quote an early review of another book, Joseph Heller's Catch-22, in what was supposed to have been an insult, &quot;The book seems not to have been written so much as shouted onto the page.&quot; Consequently, this is the rare play that not only works wonders on the stage, but is also a great work of literature: it reads very well (one can only imagine the emotional intensity of actually watching it being performed.) The book moves along at a breath-taking pace, and is a very quick read, as most plays are; there is, however, a lot more depth to it than appears on the surface. The themes it deals with are timeless and have been mined by many other playwrights, including Williams, before; indeed, they probably always will be. And yet, they endure. The story of this family struggle speaks to us in ways that few plays can from the page. A true classic of literature as well as the theatre, this work will not be lost on the reader. Williams succeeds brilliantly in his goal to capture the moving, evanescent essence of a family's interactions in motion. The gain is ours."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"I believe Tennesee Williams is the most versatile modern playwright who truly exemplifies the dysfuctionality of family morals. The Glass Menagerie, Streetcar Named Desire, and Cat On A Hot Tin Roof are indeed his masterpieces. I found Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to be my most favorite. The characters were memorable (who can forget Margaret \\"aka Maggie The Cat,\\" Brick, Big Daddy, and Big Mama?) and the lines truly classic (\\"What's the victory of a cat on a hot tin roof? Just staying on it, I guess, as long as she can...\\"). Also, just like Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on A Hot Tin Roof touched upon subjects that were controversial then and just as controversial now (homosexuality, child molestation, prostitution, etc.), which makes Tenesee William's works highly relevent. His plays age well with time. Not to mention that there have also been INCREDIBLE movie adaptations of all of his famous plays. After you read Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, or Streetcar Named Desire and The Glass Menagerie, watch the movie as well. There is no other modern playwright (except Oscar Wild and Anthony Wilson)whose plays will truly have a place in my heart for years to come."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"I received it in the mail very quickly and it was cheap.

It deals with many controversial themes such as homosexuality, alcoholism, adultery, and death. It is a true Southern masterpiece that takes place in the Mississippi Delta. Its Southern influence, language, and dialect add a lot of flavor to the novel which, in turn, transforms simple words into an intriguing story. It shows how greed and iniquities can tear a family apart, and also how death doesn't necessarily bring families together.

A girl, sitting on a rock under the shade of a large willow tree, absorbed and enchanted by the book on her knees. That was me three days ago. I started reading this play, thinking I'd read for a scene or two and then go home, but I couldn't--I eventually had to read by streetlight, I was so into the work.

Tennessee Williams's vision in this incredibly tense play is vivid and well-developed, and his attention to describing every little detail and nuance of his set, characters and even the very atmosphere is almost a little distracting... but I say this as an actress who is very unaccustomed to getting actual direction and character notes from the author rather than the director. A reader who is simply picking up this play to read it for their own edification will probably appreciate Williams's vivid descriptions.Also - and this is my fault entirely - I failed to read the specifications of the actual, physical book itself when I ordered this. It is rather tiny, with the spine measuring in at just under seven inches and the width being about four and one-quarter inches. The text is tightly packed on the page... and I suspect it will be very difficult for me to read and study from for my audition. I do appreciate the inclusion of BOTH versions of the third act, though, which is what I sought out when making this purchase.Highly recommend - perhaps not this particular edition, but definitely recommend the play itself."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"I loved how the book made me feel, every conflict was somehow interwoven into the big conflict about Big Daddy's condition.

He found comfort in names, and a wild exotic beauty, and even in his last faltering years was usually able to pull a final name out of his hat, something perfect. I remember seeing CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF on stage, with Elizabeth Ashley, some time before I read the play, so naturally my experience of the text is colored by Ashley's sizzling interpretation of Maggie the Cat, all hisses and feral screams. She was so strong I can barely remember who played Brick or Big Daddy in that production. I think it was Keir Dullea from DAVID AND LISA. Maybe Big Daddy was the man from the MUNSTERS TV show. What we, the audience, cared about was if Maggie was going to get her wway and triumph over all the mendacity and the \\"no neck monsters\\" that were swarming the plantation.Maggie gets angry, but mostly we value her for her tenderness. Even when she knows her husband has lost his heart over a long-gone teammate, and that he's probably gay, she never gives up the ship. She knows that without her in his corner 100 per cent, he'll give up, drown in his own sorrows. He needs her to kick his ass and bring him back to the land of the awake. She wasn't going to be an enabler, she would always discourage him from drinking from the time he got up in the morning till he passed out at night, his crutches tangled up in his boxer shorts. For Brick, drinking is a way out of his tortured memories of Skipper, the boy he loved in high school and college. Taking a drink is \\"like a switch, clickin' off in my head. Turns the hot light off and the cool one on and all of a sudden, there's peace.\\" Secretly the family has a plan to ship his butt off to Rainbow Hill, sort of a Betty Ford Clinic without the mercy.We love Maggie trying to semaphor the truth into his thick skull by screaming, \\"Skipper is dead but I'm alive! Maggie the Cat is alive!\\""},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"What most seem to miss about this work is the subtext placed by Williams on the psychosexual drama at work not between Brick and Maggie, which is obvious, but between Brick and Big Daddy, which is much less so. The homo-incestual dynamic between Big Daddy, who can't stand the sight of Big Mamma, and his son, Brick, who can't stand the sight of Maggie, powers the drama, and is, ultimately, the great unspoken thing, beyond even Brick's relationship with Skipper. Williams can't allow Big Daddy to make love to his son, of course, and so both must die, the former in reality, the latter only symbolicly. Left completely out, of course, are the women, who seem to have no operative place in the resolution of the conflict, but who exist merely to provoke the men toward their ultimate confrontation."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"There must be a price to pay for honesty. This \\"cat\\" says what she wants to say no matter how much this may hurt her family. She admits she's an opportunist and thats how one should live in a postmodern life as this play took place. Money and wealth are tools how she and other characters can survive in the \\"hot tin roof\\" and society in larger extant. Pride and prestige are goals the characters aim to shoot at. Lies and flattery are ways to achieve the goals and set all dreams on track. At the end, people just cant believe finding out being cheated even by their beloved ones. And the \\"cat\\" is indeed a winner from all the drama...\\"At least, Im honest\\", she said. Guess, these values of the play are because they are all everlasting lessons everybody has experienced in today's life. Willims is just too bold to put them together in such powerful play. So honest so that I dont even realize I have already felt such stories in my daily life..."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Like the other great American playwright Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams was not afraid of creating controversy through his work. Touching on themes of money, social status, and sexuality, Williams presents the dark side of each character. While it is hard to like any character, it is difficult not to be compelled by them.Brick Pollitt is the favored son. Failing to recover from the death of his best friend and fight the demons that come with booze, he has no desire to gain the good graces of his dying father and inherit his wealth. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae, that \\"monster of fertility\\", are engaged in a competition for the father's favor. But even nearing a sixth child, they can not measure up to Brick. The climax comes as Big Daddy and Brick attempt to reach the resolution that Brick has no desire to attain. Accusations of homosexuality and an inability to let go of his days as an athlete are among the reasons that Big Daddy suggests for Brick's inability to settle down and expand his family. Yet the resolution is not Brick's choice.The explosion at the end is hardly as stinging as the process of getting to the conclusion. The ultimate question is whether the cat (Margaret) will choose to stay on the hot tin roof or seek refuge. The fast paced drama moves at an unflinching pace that will make readers anticipate the direction of each page. It may be difficult for some readers to disengage from this drama."},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"Cat on A Hot Tin roof deals with love and loss, but once looked into deeper, deals with each character's take on death. this play is genius, and to give you a taste--&quot;...But a man can't buy his life with it [money], he can't buy back his life with it when his life has been spent, that's one thing not offered in the Europe fire sale or in the Amercian markets or any markets on earth, a mans can't but his life with it, he can't buy back his life when his life is finished.&quot"},{"Title":"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Signet)","review":"One of the finest American dramas.

When he does the Destroyer or Doc Savage, he delivers the real character. He does the same here with good old Nick Fury. This is the real Nick -- unshaven, tougher than nails, talking through clenched teeth that are gripping a cheap cigar.We also have thew real SHIELD, complete with helicarrier, Dum Dum Dugan, and Val (way too little of her). This reads like a really, really good comic adventure, and works. I'm willing to accept all the ESP mumbo-jumbo, but then we also have the lamest of all the old SHIELD gags -- the Life Model Decoys (LMDs). How many times can you put up with the &quot;Oh golly, it was really just a lifelike robot&quot; plot twist.A real neat cover, and interior black and white illos by the artist formerly known as Jaunty Jim Steranko, who is the only guy who could ever really draw Nick."},{"Title":"Nick Fury, Agent of Shield: Empyre","review":"For those who don't know, Nick Fury was a comic book character known to many of us thirtysomethings as Sgt.

While you don't have to have been a Sgt. Fury aficionado to like this book, it sure doesn't hurt.As long as you're willing to accept a little superhero-genre reality fudging, there's a lot to like about this story. Fury and Dum Dum Dugan (his perennial sidekick) are faithfully presented, but are not the main protagonists--that honour goes to a part-Native psi specialist who is well developed over the course of the book, earning the respect of the reader.It ain't going to make Oprah's book list, as Nick Fury might say, but it's a fun read.

Fury, and that started an obession about all the SHIELD characters. After doing a little research on the web I went back to the comic book shop and purchased dozens of old (and expensive) copies of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandoes, a war mag featuring Saint Nick before he lost an eye (one of the comics actually explained how it happened). I then went out looking for copies of Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD comic books and found this novel, EMPYRE. I immediatly grabbed and it and bought it. The cover was good, showing Nick and Contessa and Dum Dum Dugan, a LMD (Life Model Decoy) and the Helicarrier and Hydra Viper (played by Sandra Hess in the TV movie with a bad German accent). The novel itself was not like the cover. The story revolves around a plot by some Middle Eastern madman planning to bomb major world cities (including some right here in the good ol' US of A) using passenger jets rigged with Inferno 16 or some such. Nick Fury and his strong man sidekick Timothy Aloysius &quot;Dum Dum&quot; Dugan enlist the help of SHIELD's para-psych devision's head Starla Spacek to predict the whereabout of the these planes using remote viewing (check out the novel PSYCHIC WARRIOR by David Morehouse). Now the author of this novel is a known psychic and I think he tries too hard to intregrate his comic book novel writing (Doc Savage and the Destroyer) with his mind-reading job. But the main character, Starla Spacek, is very well written throughout the novel. It also helps that Starla Spacek resembles the character Kate Neville in the TV movie. If you want a straight Nick Fury story stay with the comics but if you want a story has Nick Fury in it but does not revolve around him, EMPYRE is the best bet. Also check out Christopher Golden's novel CODENAME WOLVERINE for a very good Nick Fury and SHIELD appearence."},{"Title":"Nick Fury, Agent of Shield: Empyre","review":"Will Murray has written an enjoyable romp with Nick Fury and his agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. teaming up (albeit briefly) with their foes of Hydra to prevent a madman bent on world destruction.

In one word: Nothing. \\"Ivory Tower Pinheads\\" - living a legend in their mind.Really smart academics will explain why we spend so much time in school.#1. Keep us off the streets.#2. Keep us off the job market.#3. Keep us away from Mom and Dad i.e full-time care-taker.Writer Sykes divides the three (3) traditional divisions in the modern colleges.#1. Natural Science (\\"Nature\\").#2. Social Science or Social Studies (\\"Human Society\\")#3 Humanities (Human-made art, music Literature).The only TRUE sciences is in the Natural Sciences. Natural Science is TRUE because it is based on scientific method of observation-experiment-measurement. There is really no \\"science\\" in the social sciences. Humanities, like art is purely a matter of personal opinion.If you ask 20 people, you will get 20 answers. There is no right-wrong answer. Claims cannot be stated as either TRUE-FALSE. Hence, for those seeking TRUE knowledge of the world, humanities and social sciences is really just a waste of time. Moreover, all this data, information is now free-open for fall to see on the Internet.The past is about professors. The future of education is free-open for all on the Internet.The so-called \\"soft\\" subjects will be soon be obsolete. Only the \\"hard\\" subjects like math, science, medicine, engineering and technical will be around in the future.Cheap computers now cost around $200, with cheap, universal computing connected to the universal knowledge-base known as the Internet. The college days are numbered. MIT now has posted 900 classes for free on the Internet for the whole world to see.Writer Sykes really cuts to the heart of the issue with the education-industry. Like any other industry, it is seeking more perks, privileges and money.Since students are consumers spending time and money. They should carefully consider their investment. It's probably true, colleges follow the 20-80 or 80-20 rule. 80% of the quality is from the 20 of the work-faculty.Sykes book is a \\"preview\\" of what to expect at colleges. Read as a \\"consumer report\\" find out what you are getting in the investment in time and money."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"This book is excellent. Just cross reference Loren Pope's two books--&quot;Colleges that change lives&quot;, &quot;Beyond Ivy League&quot; and you'll see that this books is right on the mark. The negative reviews for this book from the professors are not objective.You need to check with college students and graduates to get objective viewpoints. I checked with many of my friends' sons and daughers who are or were in college. Most of them said that in 4 year colleges their are or were taught by TAs during the first two years (freshman and sophomore) of their college education.I have a friend who is a high power research professor. He distains undergraduates.Also, MIT has started a program to have college seniors teach college freshman. This is even worse than having TAs teaching freshman and sophomore.This book is a must read for all parents and college-bound students. Don't be lured by college rankings--they don't tell you if professors teach undergraduate and how many of they do. Don't rely on your high school counselors. Do your own research.

America should better define what it wants its institutes of higher learnig to accomplish; to impart a better foundation in Western cultures? Less lucrative, tenure free professorships? This book is an expose' of higher education in America. Do we really want professors to concentrate on research and publishing while performing minimal teaching tasks? The book gives examples of what happens to professors that concentrate on teaching, and forgo the research, or a professor that is not politically correct. Do we want most of the student body being taught by postgraduate student, many times unable to impart their knowledge because of a bad command of the English language? Definitely a book that makes one think about the proper place and use of a valuable asset like our universities.

There are many more objective reports out there which outline the weaknesses and strengths of today's college campuses....hold out and buy something else!"},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"I read Profscam because I so enjoyed and agreed with two of Charles Sykes's other books: Dumbing Down Our Kids and A Nation Of Victims. However, I was bothered by the sweeping generalizations that he makes in Profscam. What most concerned me was his blanket statements about all faculty in higher education. Based on the examples/data he uses throughout his book he clearly is targeting the behavior of full professors in the top 10 \\"Research I\\" institutions, but then tries to generalize this behavior to all faculty members, of all ranks, at all (private and public) institutions of higher education. Although we've all heard of \\"hot shots\\" in various fields who teach little, make more than $100K/year, and have all of the perks associated with such positions, those individuals are the exception, not the norm. Salaries among educators are notoriously low. The average faculty member in higher education makes less money than the average lawyer, physician, or middle-level manager, even though the number of years spent in school in order to obtain his/her Ph.D. degree is higher than that for the other occupations. A disturbing comment Sykes makes is that faculty only work the 8-16 hours a week that they're in the classroom teaching. This is as distorted as believing that lawyers only work when they're in court or physicians only work while operating on someone. Perhaps the \\"hot shots\\" in Research I institutions teach the same courses using old notes or can obtain teaching waivers if they have important grants, as Sykes implies, but the average academic easily spends 50-70 hours/week on teaching, course preparation and grading, advising/mentoring, writing, research, and university committee and community work. Even if we look only at Research I institutions, Sykes's accusation that students are not being taught by faculty is misplaced. Students who apply to such Research I institutions do so because of their reputation. However, few students ponder where that reputation originates. Quite simply, it comes from the research that the faculty conduct. Prospective students and parents are deluding themselves if they expect to find a lot of one-on-one attention from such faculty members. A quick look at these institutions' mission statements, the existence of doctoral graduate programs, and the student:teacher ratios should provide a clear indication that these institutions' goals are research-oriented not teaching-oriented. To go there expecting them to be teaching-oriented seems nave and Sykes's accusation places blame on the wrong shoulders. The counter argument here might be, if these Research I institutions are not taking their teaching duties seriously then why should be they be paid to \\"exist\\" in the first place? But to that objection must be framed a counter-question: \\"who is to conduct \`pure' research if not the faculty members in higher education?\\" I agree with Sykes that sometimes this research is trivial and not applicable to larger social problems but the hallmark of such research is that it is (comparatively) less-biased than the politically-determined governmental research or the for-profit research conducted in industry because the sponsors are not as explicitly after particular results that will enhance their positions/status (or pockets). As a result, polemical areas can be studied without concern for reprisals (one of the key reasons for the need for tenure). In addition, research also benefits teaching, both invigorating those who produce the scholarship and aiding those who use the textbooks which frequently result from it. Sykes's assertion that tenured faculty go unpunished is simply false. There are many subtle and not so subtle ways of punishing the tenured, from taking away laboratory space, switching offices, not giving raises, pressuring them to teach \\"service\\" courses, blackballing their grants, to administrative pressure to resign or accept a buyout or the simple elimination of a position and the professor along with it. On a more positive note, I do agree with Sykes's overall assertion that students are not getting as good an undergraduate education as they could/deserve. This may be partially because of the emphasis on research and lack of contact with faculty members that he describes but I also believe it is because of the desire for applied pre-professional education demanded by students today. As Sykes points out, the original ideal of an intellectual background of shared knowledge that would make all individuals \\"learned\\" is fading. That is a pity. While he blames the early German, research-centered model of higher education, he neglects to mention the overpowering effect of the Progressive era in this country and its appeal to application and utility. He is also quite on target in bemoaning the trendy focus on \\"theory\\" in the humanities, and the profspeak which, although he attributes to all academics, is more rampant among the poststructuralists. His complaint about offering narrow, specialized, and esoteric courses at the expense of broad core curriculum courses that would allow for a shared body of knowledge couldn't be more accurate. In today's highly politicized and overly sensitive academic environment, diversity and rejection of a purported elitism tend to be explanations or excuses provided for this. But Sykes's argument that it is less work to deconstruct than to construct seems more adequate, particularly in the areas where poststructuralism is most prevalent (literature and literary theory, communication, semiotics, english, history, philosophy). It is hard to contribute something original to the literature when you're using texts that have already been studied for centuries. It is easier to create a career out of deconstructing them. Overall, although I enjoyed this book, I think it's unfortunate that the genuine issues Sykes is trying to highlight ended up undermined by his sensationalistic, journalistic style of writing."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"I'm a prof but was a student, when this book was written. I seldom had a class taught by a TA. When I did, it was excellent. I had close interactions with famous profs throughout my education. But Sykes's anecdotes are real stories during the same period as my education. Many of his observations, of how the academic game is played, are also true. The take-home message is: let the buyer beware. It's a gross error of the book to do a hatchet job on profs -- you can find good ones all over. But if you don't do your homework, you could spend megabucks on higher education and get ripped off. I'm thankful to have had the opposite experience. I started by choosing to attend Seattle University, where it was obvious they actually read my required essay from the application, unlike several top-ranked schools that had accepted me. From there, I was mostly lucky. It's still possible to get an excellent value for your higher education dollar. This book throws the baby out with the bath water, but it does tell you what to watch out for."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"I am currently finishing my masters degree and am researching doctoral degress. Unfortunately, I not only enjoyed this book, but recognized many things in it as so true that they were funny (and sad).Point: Universities are much less concerned with teaching students as they are with plumping out research that is trivial, abstruse, and to all but maybe 10 peers who will read the resulting article, irrelevent (and those ten are reading it to cite it in the next essay). Point: The humanities have done away with virtually all standards, are interested in theory that poorly reflects the real world, and consist mostly of 'guts' courses that are called that because they are so easy one can pass the tests on gut instincts. Point: tenure is partially destroying education. Once designed as a bastion of academic freedom, now it serves to insulate already detached professors even more from the real world, and destroy any notion of accountability.Here's the books downfall: it is so eager to point out these things (even though the book is for the most part right on) that it ends up sounding paranoid and overly combative. Every example of a poor professor is accompanied by an adjective like &quot;assinine&quot; or &quot;abysmal&quot;. There was even one section where the author points out that &quot;one study says...&quot; in order to show how bad social science education is. I was left wondering....what the other studies said. In other words, the book leaves us with a feeling that while largely correct, the author may have been a.) selective and b.) a little overeager to rip on all things academic for the meer sake the it feels good.But the main messages is that education is overpriced while quality declines. The proffesoriate cares infinitely more about themselves (and their obscure research) then their students. Graduate students do the teaching while professors 'play at' writing important things. This is all, unfortunately, true. But I do want to write that while the author is quite pessimistic, I am not. I am currently finishing graduate work at a small liberal arts college in Richmond, VA (if you'd like you can figure out which one as there is only one). There, the teachers teach, there is no such thing as a teachers assistant, class comes before research, and classes are small enough where students even have the teachers home phone. Anyone contemplating colleges I urge you to read this book and consider the smaller liberal arts schools (and the one I'm at is top notch).Good book!"},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"Some professors still revere scholarship and take seriously their professional responsibility to pass their knowledge to succeeding generations.

This was not out of malice, but simply a realization that the system does not reward dedication to teaching and effective advising. For example, a colleague of mine got ripped in his student evaluations twice, so what does the department head do? He removes him from teaching undergraduate courses altogether, leaving him with two independent-study graduate courses. My colleague also got promoted the same year. What a deal! All this while I am teaching 30% above capacity and getting nothing but jealousy from a few of my colleagues. My research and publication output was not compromised (any more than others), but department politics were not kind to me. Later, I took a faculty position in the College of Engineering where students WERE first. So, problems vary with the culture of the department. The author does generalize a bit, but faculty should only be offended if he/she is the offender. All of us have seen instances of what Charles has described in academia. My advice to a new faculty member...if it smells bad, change the scenery, QUICK!"},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"This book exposes the myths of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral education in America. From my own experience, and from what I have read in this book, a college education at a community college may be superior to that of an Ivy League college like Harvard or Yale, especially if you end up in a classroom filled with an auditorium of hundreds of students, and in the professor's place is a graduate student teaching assistant who may have no experience in teaching the class you are taking. The professor is not in class because teaching is not what counts, it is meaningless reasearch for publication that allows a college professor to keep his job, and line his pockets with money from corporations who hire him as a consultant away from the college campus. Students deserve better than this! If what is written in this book is true, you just might be better off going to the public library to educate yourself. You won't have a degree, but at least you won't be an uneducated college graduate."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"This book was written in 1988. At the time is was written, it was a very accurate portrayal of what was happening to undergraduates in America's large universities. I attended one of the schools he mentioned back then and I can tell you from first hand experience that it was very accurate. However, I believe that in the years since then, the situation has improved, possibly because of books like this, the efficiencies brought about by computers, and also because of the pressure brought to bear by ranking reports such as that done by US News.If you are criticising this book yet you attended a nice, small, expensive elite liberal arts college, you should seriously ask yourself if you really know what the heck you are talking about. Many of the privately educated graduate students at my university thought that things were just hunky-dory for us undergraduates. They underestimated the importance of all the attention and quality teaching they had received at their private school and figured we would be fine without it (or if we weren't fine, we must be stupid). I find that people who got what they needed at that age tend to have a blind spot for the incredible importance of quality, concientous teaching."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"The state of American education is appalling, but it isn't the administration to blame. It is the profs. And Sykes minces no words. Here is a mere sample of his indictment: \\"No understanding of the academic disease is possible without an understanding of the Academic Man, this strange mutation of 20th-century academia who has the pretensions of an ecclesiastic, the artfulness of a witch doctor, and the soul of a bureaucrat. His greatest triumph has been the creation of an academic culture that is one of society's most outrageous and elaborate frauds. It is replete with the pieties, arcane rituals, rites of passage, and dogmas of a secular faith. . . . Ultimately, the academic culture represents a sort of modern-day alchemy in which mumbo-jumbo is transformed into gold, or, in this case, into research grants, consulting contracts, sabbaticals, and inflated salaries\\" (pp. 4-5). And this is only a sample of his bill of indictment!The book is full of lingo, rhetoric, and name-calling. But through all the words, which actually make an otherwise dull subject electric, his contentions hit the mark bulls-eye. The faculty has the power to determine the product, the terms upon which it will be offered, and the customers who will be served. Profs are hyper-specialists, instead of offering students a general education. They are institutionally rewarded for more research grants and publications, and punished for good teaching and time spent interacting with students. In the past twenty years, profs have had decreased teaching loads while huge increases in salaries. Academic democratization has lowered standards while inflating grades. Academic thought police have promoted prof freedoms while imprisoning students in by-gone ideologies. Rather than broadening minds, the academic culture has ended up ratifying and strengthening our culture's most basic features. The rich humanities have been replaced by the sterile statistics of the social sciences.Sykes blames the profs, but it's the culture of academia that is often the problem. Profs are forced to publish or perish, and they have to specialize in minute details to get published. And outstanding teaching is simply on the backburner of most of the major university's job descriptions. In order to survive in academia, they have to play the game of academia. Grade inflation occurs because so many low grades merely get student complaints to adminstrators who pressure grades upward. Student evaluations forced by accreditation agencies force profs to entertain students rather than educate them."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"Everyone who has worked in academia has their collection of horror stories: those anecdotal observations of conduct that are somewhat disturbing to those who have not been initiated in the rites of passage that are unique to the university. Here are some of the many that were witnessed/experienced by this reviewer:1. At a university in Missouri, a PhD staff member gave some very modest suggestions to an otherwise mediocre undergraduate laboratory manual. The authors of this manual, insulted by these suggestions, retaliated with a vengeance that lasted for years, with the result that the staff member was finally dismissed.2. At a university in Texas, a professor copied a well-known copyrighted textbook word-for-word and sold the copies to his class. So how did he think he could get around the copyright restrictions? He copied it longhand.3. At a university in Missouri, one professor volunteered to take part in a teacher's preparation workshop, something that he felt was beneath him as his prior dialog readily indicated. So why did he participate? To obtain the grant that was attached to the attendance, monies of which he used to pay for a vacation overseas.4. At a university in South Dakota, a faculty member was promised that as of being hired, he would have full authority in choosing the textbook. When he began his employment, he quickly learned that the vice-president of the university approved all selections of textbooks, which he did without reservation.There are many more such stories, but they are merely anecdotes, and it would be wrong to conclude that they reflect the moods and ethics of people in American universities. To understand these would take a time-consuming, exhaustive effort, more than most would be willing to undertake. This book is not one of these studies, but is only a hurried diatribe that lashes out at American higher education, which at the time of publication was a practice that was just beginning. It currently seems to be the rage, and shows no sign of going away. It is popular to smear the university, and the evidence used to do so is frequently weak and insufficiently researched. This book does however have some value in the sense that it can be read by anyone interested in how pundits and self-professed journalists have criticized the university, and the degree to which they have instigated a large following or engaged public sympathies.At various places in the book the author blasts research projects that he thinks are trivial or unnecessary, and clearly believes that it is these projects that are representative and proof that the university is a racket, producing junk that nobody cares anything about. As an example of this, he refers to a paper entitled \\"A Functional Approach to Interruptions in Conversation, a Mathematical Analysis\\" which as part of its analysis included the counting of the \\"ers\\" and \\"uhs\\" in conversation. He seems to think that this research is completely irrelevant, but actually it is of great interest to groups such as \\"The Toastmasters\\" who grade speaking ability on the number of these kinds of annoying pauses when their members practice their speeches. It is also of interest to neuroscientists who are studying language disorders, since such interruptions, if excessive, may point to neuronal maladies in the speech areas of the brain. It is also of interest to the military as even slight exposure to powerful neurotoxins can cause excessive interruptions in the flow of speech.The author does not mention a few of the more deplorable and unethical features of the research university, such as the wide practice in research papers on designating an \\"author to whom correspondence should be addressed\\". This allows one author to control the feedback process and actually take more (or complete) credit for the paper. He also only makes passing reference to the anonymous review system, which encourages recklessness in criticism and an excess of vituperation. Such a practice should stop, with reviewers signing their name to the review just like they would if they were in fact the authors. The anonymous reviewing system makes no sense at all and has no place in rational discourse. Also not mentioned in the book is the deplorable practice of placing phony employment advertisements in academic journals so as to make it appear to satisfy an Affirmative Action requirement. Candidates are interviewed, and ethnic or gender identification carried out, but the departments involved do not even have the necessary funds to hire anyone, minority or not.The author offers solutions to the \\"problems\\" (as he sees it) of the university. His first suggestion is to change its research emphasis, and focus more on teaching, but in this regard he gives no evidence, and does not present a metric, that would allow him to classify only one in ten academics as producing original research of any \\"value\\". This is a statistical claim, but he offers zero evidence for it, and if he attempted to he would find it to be a formidable project, due to the subjective nature of assigning \\"value\\" to a research project or manuscript. One can be sympathetic to the author's suggestion to abolish tenure, but another option may be to limit it to a maximum block of time, say twenty years, with no possibility of renewal. Candidates who enter the university under tenure track contracts would undergo tenure review after five years, and if granted, would be allowed fifteen more years to conduct research or engage in teaching.But it is difficult, if not impossible, to legislate against stupidity, cowardice, incompetence, or arrogance. The faculty, staff, and students of a university have their own biases and aspirations, and they will continue to have these despite legislation to the contrary. It is easy to complain about the current makeup of the university, but it is quite another thing to construct a sound, scientific analysis, backed up by hard evidence, of the workings of the same. Again, the author does not do this, and only now are there studies appearing that are more scholarly and coherent. And technological advances may force the universities to change, due mostly to the increase in the availability of free information and automated learning and tutoring tools. This technology may in fact make the university research professor a white elephant, or even an extinct species after this century has ended."},{"Title":"Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education","review":"Martin Anderson's, &quot;Imposters in the Temple&quot; is another one.The people who have slamed this aren't being objective, orhaven't sat through 40 classes at their Institutions like the undergraduates do.

The tribe was known as the Quinnipiac tribe. Known today as Quiripi-Unquachog, this dialect was spoken in much of southwestern coastal Connecticut, as well as in parts of Long Island.This booklet contains a two page, 1658 letter, from the Commissioners of the United Colonies, in Boston. They were writing to the directors of the New England Company, back in London. This letter defends their decision to have the Quinnipiac catechism printed in New England rather than back in London. The reasoning seems to have been that this decision allowed for local translators to be nearby, in case translation issues or other problems arose in the course of the printing. The letter also contains some discussion of bills, and concludes with an affirmation of the Commissioners' high hopes for the spiritual edification of the \\"poore natives\\" of the New Haven, Connecticut area.There is another letter accompanying the first one, from John Eliot, the \\"Apostle to the Indians.\\" A native of Roxbury, very near to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Eliot is chiefly remembered today for having translated the entire bible into Massachusett, the dialect indigenous to Eastern Massachusetts and the surrounding region. His letter isn't explicitly about Abraham Pierson's catechism. Rather, it is a broader appeal to the Board of Directors of the New England Company, asking them to support the drive to translate materials for religious instruction into the local dialects.After Eliot's letter, several pages are missing. If it is known what was once contained in those pages, I am unaware of that knowledge. I have not been able to come up with anything useful about the missing pages, although that doesn't necessarily mean that someone out there hasn't done a thesis on it at some point.The boolet resumes at page 24, with a few short paragraphs by Abraham Pierson. These words are addressed not to the Quinnipiac people, but to English readers. He makes several points about pronunciation, accent, and grammar. This section is very short, but it still has value to students of this topic.The catechism itself is only ten pages long, including the title page. It could be of interest to a student of Algonquian linguistics, or to someone with an interest in early English religions in America. I myself came to this text as part of a hobby, which is learning what I can about the early tongues spoken in New England. I noticed that this text has a lot in common with Massachusett, but with some differences. I understand the natives of local tribes could communicate, but from eastern Massachusetts to New Haven was starting to push it a little... Watch for the word \\"mandoo,\\" a local variation of the better-known \\"manitou,\\" referring to God, or to more general supernatural power. This appears very similar to the old Mohegan Pequot term \\"mandu.\\" Iam not qualified to comment too much beyond this, although I tentatively have noted a few other points. Keep an eye out for things like the use of \\"qua\\" for \\"and,\\" instead of Massachusett \\"kah.\\" \\"Matta\\" is exactly the same, as the word for \\"not\\" in both dialects. The words for \\"light\\" seem to differ slightly, being \\"wequai\\" in Massachusett, but \\"wequai-ai\\" in Quripi-Unquachog. This is just a hobby for me, I'm still learning. Anyway, if you want to try to make this your own hobby, look for John Eliot's \\"Indian Primer,\\" which cotains a small catechism in Massachusett. You can find some of your own points of comparison. Also, you need to know about the Smithsonian's \\"Handbook of North American Indians,\\" volume 15, pages 70-77. This contains a great article that places Quiripi-Unquachog in linguistic context, and also has a helpful chart of phonetic relationships between this tongue and related Algonquian dialects.After the catechism, there is a postscript written by Charles Chauncy, the contemporary president of Harvard College. He makes the point that some \\"indians\\" had already proven to be apt students of the printed word, and that he had great hopes for their \\"perfectibility.\\"Make sure you also check out the article I mentioned in the Smithsonian \\"handbook\\" (which is really a huge set of encyclopedias, taking up an entire bookshelf). Also, see the lists and guides I've placed on my reviewer's page, for some further suggestions related to this fascinating topic."},{"Title":"Abraham Pierson's Some Helps for the Indians: Gershom Bulkeley's Will and Doom...

On the surface it's a sentimental Civil War romance novel: Northern boy with an abolitionist mentor meets Southern girl from old, aristocratic, slaveholding Virginia family in antebellum St. Louis Missouri. Get beyond it.Get deeper into it though and we meet Ulysses Grant, not as a General but as a failed businessman. We meet Sherman before he got his stripes. We meet Abraham Lincoln during the period of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and the author takes the time and respects his readers' intelligence enough to get into the philosophical and rhetorical merits of Lincoln's debating techniques and the Republican Party's platform. The title of the books is drawn from a question put by Lincoln to Douglas at their Fairfield, Illinois debate. In developing his thesis on the Civil War, the author goes into great detail to explain how a desire for Liberty drove a wave of German immigrants to American shores in the mid-1800s where, as war approached, they displayed pro-Union sympathies. The author's thesis itself is that the American Civil War was not an indigenous event but was rather an chapter in an ongoing struggle between factions of the Anglo-Saxon race, a struggle between Cavaliers and Puritans going back to the days of King Charles I.All-in-all, a book that opens the eyes to different ways of thinkin'. Readers looking for expressions of true equality of the freedmen or non Anglo-Saxon Europeans will not find these."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"Hopefully the confusion over the two Winston Churchills has been straightened out for anyone searching this page; the Churchill who wrote THE CRISIS was an American novelist, not the British leader (though they knew each other and even met once). During the time this book was written the novelist Churchill was much better known than Sir Winston.This book is Churchill's second historical novel and is concerned with the Civil War mainly around the St. Louis area. As with the previous novel, RICHARD CARVEL, Churchill did a great deal of research before writing his book. In fact, it's the history that's revealed in the book that most impresses; those things that make for a superb novelist , especially plausible character development and credible dialogue, were often lacking in Churchill's works. Stephen Brice, a Bostonian lawyer, comes to St. Louis and falls in love with Virginia Carvel (daughter of Colonel Carvel from the earlier novel), who shuns him because he's a Northerner. Brice joins the Union army when the war breaks out, and through him we encounter major historical figures, including Grant and Lincoln. The climax comes when Brice goes to Lincoln to ask for the release of Virginia's captured lover, Colfax; Lincoln agrees and Virginia is amazingly impressed with Lincoln's goodness and wishes all in the South could appreciate him as she has learned to do. It's about as bad as it sounds.Although parts of the story are pretty exciting, just about all the characters are cardboard cutouts. Even Grant, perhaps his best drawn character, appears and sounds nothing like the general encountered in the history books. Churchill refused to make his characters multi-dimensional: they are either all good or all bad, there is no in-between. He also followed the standard formula for romantic fiction, with the lovers at odds over opposing \\"principles,\\" who over time, in which they are able to demonstrate their noblest qualities, are reconciled. This formula has fallen out of fashion today (though when done well can still make for exceptional fiction), and most modern readers might find the history in the book more appealing than the love story (if they can make it through the love story). The best thing in the book might be the way St. Louis is portrayed; Churchill accurately represents the city, especially the less familiar German element of it. The novel was extremely popular when it first came out - it sold 100,000 copies in the first few days of publication - and it probably will still find favor with those who enjoy old-fashioned romantic novels who can suspend much of their disbelief for 500 pages or so."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"Forget the above quote about Eliphalet Hopper. Turns out he's a minor player. The true main character is Bostonian Stephen Brice and his long, long, looonnnnggg unspoken love for uppity Southern Belle Virginia Carvel. In between the years when they first meet to finally confessing their love for each other a minor thing known as the Civil War occurs. The setting is mainly St. Louis, a city like many others that is divided in its loyalties. Real-life people pop up now and then, like an unknown Grant delivering firewood and energetic Sherman in charge of a car line. Abraham Lincoln might as well be the Second Coming the way the author goes on and on about him. I'm giving the book three stars because it does move at a good pace and keeps you interested until the end. However, you must keep in mind the times and ways things used to be when this book was originally written. If you're offended by the N-word this novel may not be for you as it is used regularly."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"This account of the Civil War was written by the American author Winston Churchill, whose poularity at the turn of the century was apparently enough that a similarly named young Englishman though it necessary to add his middle initial, \\"S\\" to his name to differentiate himself. This book is set in St Louis, covering the period from 1852 to 1865. By today's standards it is politically INcorrect as all get-out. But is still an interesting look at the Civil War and a look at turn-of-the-century America's view of the conflict and its protagonists."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"The book arrived in good condition. To my surprise this was a 1901 copyright book."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"I found this book in my grandmother's collection and had some problems with the first chapter. But once you slip into the prose, it becomes much easier. First of all, yes, the novel could be seen as politically incorrect. Though using the language of an era doesn't necessarily denote endorsement. Furthermore, the entire vocabulary of multiculturalism had not even begun to be conceived of when Churchill wrote the book.The book is an interesting look at St. Louis during the prelude and main act of the Civil War. It is interesting both because the historiographic perspective of the writer is different from that of contemporary writers and because of the novel's setting in the Western theater. I recommend the book for anyone looking for a different take on a Civil War character-driven novel."},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"The American author, Winston Churchill, chose to set the action in his home town of St. Louis, because it was the site of pivotal events in the western theater of the Civil War, with historically prominent citizens having both Northern and Southern sympathies. St. Louis was also the pre-war home of both Ulysses Grant and William Sherman, who are depicted with drama and realism.Romantic tension develops between the four main characters: one the fashionable daughter of a southern gentleman of the old school, another her n'er-do-well cousin who becomes a stalwart cavalier in the Southern cause to win her approval, the third an earnest young lawyer from Boston who antagonizes her by his zeal for Abraham Lincoln's cause, and the fourth a hard-working clerk with ambitions to advance himself both financially and socially.\\"The crisis\\" is provoked by Abraham Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery, and the power of his personal integrity to win people to his cause, including the young lawyer, who becomes a devoted admirer and proponent following a personal interview on the eve of the Freeport debate between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. This meeting depicts Lincoln's determination to advance the cause of freedom through the possible (and likely) sacrifice of his own political ambitions, and is related with a very believable combination of rustic humor and political acumen on Lincoln's part.The events prior to Lincoln's nomination and his eventual election to the Presidency elicit different reactions among the citizens of St. Louis, from the determined antipathy of the Southern sympathizers, to the equally determined patriotism of the population of German immigrants who have fled from their homeland and whose devotion to liberty has caused them to transfer their allegiance to the ideal of American democracy. One of them is a fellow lawyer who bears the scar of a duel fought with broadswords between himself and an arrogant German noble; a duel based on an actual incident in Berlin.Although the personal rivalries follow an almost soap opera style formula, the overall events of the war from the perspective of St. Louis and the Western theater of war are dramatically depicted with well-researched authenticity, and both Grant and Sherman are depicted as having a personal involvement in the lives of the main characters. A pivotal moment in the heroine's life is presented through her transformation from being self-centered and self-absorbed to becoming self-sacrificing and dedicated to easing the suffering of others. This is represented as a Christian metaphor for the way that God uses challenges to mould a person's character.Eventually she and the young lawyer find themselves meeting Lincoln together to try to save her cousin's life, and together they experience Lincoln's power to bring about a reconciliation between them; just before the national reconciliation which Lincoln proposed between the North and the South would be aborted by John Wilkes Booth's bullet.This novel is a story about Abraham Lincoln in the same sense that the novel Ben Hur is \\"a tale of the Christ,\\" in that Lincoln only appears twice, for a total of about two dozen pages, but his philosophy is a dynamic presence throughout the story. As a side note: General Lew Wallace wrote Ben Hur partly as a way to revive his reputation in the aftermath of the battle of Shiloh, in which his division played an undistinguished role, marching and countermarching futilely the first day of the battle, the aftermath of which left Sherman so discouraged that he remarked to Grant, \\"They sure whupped us today!\\" To which Grant replied, \\"Yep. We'll whup them tomorrow,\\" and they did.In his post-script, the author offers this apology for supporting Lincoln's point of view, by explaining, \\"Lincoln loved both the South and the North.\\""},{"Title":"The Crisis","review":"I found this book on the shelf of books we moved in with my grandfather.

I then came across this one in my search for more material having to do with the Deaf in Germany. This book was originally a dissertation, however, Gallaudet Press and the translater, William Sayers, did a great job in turning what would be a dry dissertation into a short, but interesting book.Horst Biesold is an interpreter who in the performance of his job, came across members of the German deaf community who were finally willing to tell their story about being forced to undergo sterilization. He writes with obvious concern for and about his deaf clients, and the emotional and psychological impact that the eugenics laws had on these people. It is with concern and dismay that I am researching the same subject only in the United States, since the Nazis often wrote that many of their ideas and programs were first proffered by eugenicists in the U.S.This book is a good reminder that when societies don't stand up for what is right, even when it does not directly affect most individuals, you cannot tell how far the 'slippery slope' is going to go. The Holocaust did not just become the Final Solution for the Jews, but included the gypsies and the disabled, and those who were considered 'life unworthy of life.' With the completion of the Human Genome Project, and proponents of euthanasia getting more vocal, and doctors like Kervorkian, and HMOs who put their bottom line before the worth of people...it is all too possible that this horror could happen again, and in this country. I urge ethicists, physicians, and educators to read this book as well as members of the deaf/disabled community so that we can protect ourselves from those who would put less value on our lives for whatever reason.

Wiener wrote this entirely equationless text as a populariztion of his ideas about humans and machines. this book is a fascinating piece of philosophy and sociology also, as Wiener expands his theories and brings them to bear on history, journalism etc. He never loses his scientific perspective though; this gives his writing and ideas a clarity freshness that is uncommon in theoretical writings about society. This is a great and important book"},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","review":"More than fifty years after its initial publication, this book remains as relevant and prophetic as it is brilliant and exhilarating.To start, Wiener explains cybernetics in a way that the intelligent layperson can understand; he discusses how human beings, animals, and machines relate to one another through communication and feedback, thus becoming systems that limit or temporarily reverse the universal tendency toward disorganization (entropy). After establishing this framework, he discusses the implications of cybernetics on society. As he takes cybernetic theory to its logical conclusions--that is, accounting for the communication and feedback between human beings, machines, and the environment as a whole--his insights are shown to be profoundly humane and ultimately very inspiring.This is no ordinary scientific text. There are discussions of Augustinian vs. Manichaean worldviews and their implications; the inevitable spread of dangerous information (such as that resulting in the atomic bomb) despite the strenuous efforts of governments; and the need not to rely on machines--non-human machines as well as \\"human machines\\" such as bureaucracies and corporations--to do the difficult work that human beings must do to remain ethical, responsible, and free.All in all, this is an outstanding book written in lucid, beautiful prose. The book tells us as much about the systems that make up our world as it does about the brilliance, humility, and humanity of Wiener himself. No summary of this book, in blurb or review format, can possibly do justice to Wiener's achievement."},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","review":"Wiener was acutely aware of the promise and the danger of the new technolgies he was helping to invent. He worked very hard during the Second World War to help develop an anti- aircraft system which would make use of some of his mathematical and technical innovations. However the dropping of the Atomic Bomb turned him wholly against the military establishment and he became an insistent voice calling for regulation of military technologies.His own vision of a humane society is one in which the cybernetic and feedback elements enable a better managing of the economy and society as a whole. And this when he again was very concerned about the possible destructive elements of technologies which would provide unreasonable means of control over individual human lives. He very much was concerned that a society in which machine- slaves produced everything would deprive humanity of its freedom and dignity.In other words he saw great promise in the new technologies but also was concerned that might exercise a degree of control over humanity which would make them more harmful than beneficial."},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","review":"Norbert Wiener was a child prodigy and Professor of Mathematics at MIT from 1919 until his death in 1964. He invented the science of cybernetics (look it up in the dictionary) and the guided missile but refused to help the military during the cold war. This volume includes an open letter published in the January, 1947 Atlantic Monthly magazine entitled \\"A Scientist Rebels\\" by Norbert Wiener. An introduction by Wiener biographer Steve J. Heims provides a context for Wiener's works.If you are at all interested in cybernetics, and particularly interested in the effects it is having and will have on society, this book is must reading. Of course, this book does not approach Wiener's \\"God &amp; Golem, Inc.\\"(reviewed elsewhere in Amazon.com) for sheer brilliance, but then, what does, except perhaps the \\"Bahir.\\""},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","review":"Norbert Wiener was the intellectual giant central to the birth of cybernetics. As described in \\"The Human Use of Human Beings\\" (1950), cybernetics was coined by Wiener to describe the emerging post-war synthesis of control, communication, and information, and its applications to technology, biology, social sciences, and seemingly everything. It was a remarkably ambitious project, which would eventually be sidetracked by personal politics and its displacement by digital computation and AI, but many of the prescient ideas of cybernetics and Wiener live on.To be honest, \\"The Human Use of Human Beings\\" is somewhat of a mess. The unifying vision is undoubtedly there, but Wiener is remarkably discursive, venturing into tangential topics such as linguistic history, Leibniz' philosophy of monads, ciphers, prosthetics, chess playing machines, trial lawyers, and \\"the idea that one might conceivably travel by telegraph\\". Yet, it wouldn't be Wiener otherwise. These are the disorganized thoughts of one of the twentieth century's great geniuses and polymaths.The book begins with cybernetics, that nexus of control, communication, feedback, information, entropy, and probability. To Wiener, the applied mathematician of statistical mechanics, his synthesis reflects \\"the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life\\" (it is \\"Gibbs rather than Einstein or Heisenberg or Planck to whom we must attribute the first great revolution of twentieth century physics\\"). Against a \\"Niagara of increasing entropy\\", cybernetics is concerned with local enclaves in which order fights back in vain - \\"life finds its home in some of these enclaves\\", that is \\"the physical functioning of the living individual and the operation of some of the newer communication machines are precisely parallel in their analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback\\" - or more poetically, \\"We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water\\".On the topic of biology Wiener follows Hebb in anticipating synaptic plasticity, and also anticipates chemical neuromodulators (\\"To-whom-it-may-concern messages\\"), and discusses the heoretical role of the cerebellum and striatum in intention/Parkinsonian tremor. In linguistics, he discusses early information theoretical applications. Yet Wiener had already discussed the fundamentals in his best-selling \\"Cybernetics\\". \\"The Human Use of Human Beings\\" is largely remembered for Wiener as the Cassandra of Cold War science (in fact, Wiener wanted to title the book \\"Cassandra\\" or \\"Pandora\\", but was dissuaded by his publisher).\\"The new industrial revolution is a two-edged sword. It may be used for the benefit of humanity... It may also be used to destroy humanity\\". Wiener envisions mass automation,: \\"it will take the new tools ten to twenty years to come into their own\\", resulting in an \\"immediate transitional period of disastrous confusion\\", with devastating consequences for labor. \\"Let us remember that the automatic machine... is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic conditions of slave labor.\\" At one point Wiener mentions the player piano, and one has to wonder if this influenced the young writer and Wiener reader Kurt Vonnegut.There are also prescient environmental concerns here, two decades before the growth of the environmental movement: \\"We have modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in this new environment.\\" But even more terrifying, Wiener raises the specter of the totalitarian automated state: \\"machines, though helpless by themselves, may be used by a human being or a block of human beings to increase their control over the rest of the human race\\". At the heart of Wiener's jeremiad is a deep scientific humanism. The flexible human differs from the rigid ant, and \\"if the human being is condemned and restricted to perform the same functions over and over again, he will not even be a good ant, not to mention a good human being.\\" In fact, Wiener's cybernetic views of entropy extend to his ethics, as a Gibbsian view of order and disorder leads him to a \\"negative evil which St. Augustine characterizes as incompleteness, rather than the positive malicious evil of the Manichaeans\\".At the outbreak of McCarthyism, Wiener (who was tracked closely by the FBI) was sharply critical of both American capitalism and Soviet Communism. Americans may have \\"know-how\\", but lack \\"know-what\\", that is the humanistic purposes that should drive society. America is faced with the \\"propaganda\\" of \\"entrepreneurs\\" with \\"very few inhibitions when it comes to taking all the profit out of an industry that there is to be taken, and then letting the public pick up the pieces.\\" Wiener is staunchly opposed to American militarism, secrecy, the commodification of information, and is critical of mass consumerism: \\"when there is communication without need for communication... the quality and communicative value of the message drop like a plummet.\\" Indeed, much of Wiener's criticism seems to echo Marx (two of Wiener's closests friends were the Marxists Dirk Van Struik and J.B.S. Haldane): \\"When human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible human beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is flesh and blood. What is used as an element in a machine, is in fact an element in the machine.\\" Indeed, Wiener concedes that \\"it appears that Marx's own view was Augustinian\\", but Stalinism is another matter entirely. \\"Communism has grown up in an atmosphere of combat and conflict\\" and \\"takes attitudes which are definitely Manichaean\\", such that now \\"The Marxist Queen is very arbitrary indeed\\".\\"The Human Use of Human Beings\\" also includes some of Wiener's thoughts on the historical development of science, technology and capitalism, which he presents in a manner that echoes Marxist historiography. Although brief, Wiener discusses the history of trade and navigation, mechanics, steam engines & industry, electricity, the vaccum tube, and radio and computing machines. Along the way, Wiener notes the \\"exploitation of the labor of children and women to an extent, and of a brutality scarcely conceivable at the present time.\\" Wiener's historical overview ends with the importance of the war effort, in which Wiener worked on analog predictive anti-aircraft computation.This work also includes many of Wiener's thoughts on science. Wiener champions intellectual freedom and rails against secrecy while lamenting the \\"cancer of creative narrowness and feebleness\\" and \\"a generation of young men who cannot think of any scientific project except in terms of large numbers of men and large quantities of money.\\" He alludes to W. W. Jacob's \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" and warns scientists not to \\"calmly transfer to the machine made in his own image the responsibility for his choice of good and evil, without continuing to accept a full responsibility for that choice.\\" The scientist may just \\"cast his responsibility to the winds, and to find it coming back seated on the whirlwind.\\"Wiener was famous for his manic depression, and this work is decidedly bipolar - as it should be. Wiener is full of excited possibility, while at times he can be Manichaen himself: \\"The hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.\\" Prometheus or Pandora."},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","review":"Amazing book that is very thought provoking.

I came across \\"Innocent Journey\\" during my stay in Pohang South Korea, December 2002. Yoko Noda a college student, barely 20 years of age, involves herself with a seemingly successful, very much married and older man in his late 30's. Takashi Sato is this such man. Lately his life has taken a turn for more than the worse. His wife Midori Sato has a terrible secret that threatens to destroy their relationship. His company, Sato Metal Industries is falling apart. If things couldn't possibly get any worse, one day while driving to work, he accidently hits and kills a child who was chasing after a ball in the street. Although Takaski is found innocent, the child's family in particular the grandfather, is constantly reminding Takashi of this tragic accident. At this point, a very despondent Takaski Sato, tells his mistress (Yoko Noda) that he can't go on living and asks if she would commit suicide with him. Taken aback upon her lovers request, Yoko Noda realizes that she too has felt that her life is meaningless. Together they set off to Amagi Mountain to commit a \\"lovers suicide\\" by way of sleeping pills. After engulfing 50 sleeping pills each, a disoriented Yoko Noda soon realizes that during the course of her deep sleep that she regurgitated a good majority of the sleeping pills! She soon realizes that her lover, Takashi Sato is dead, but not from the overdose. Takashi Sato was stabbed in the back with a hunting knife. To make matters worse, Yoko Noda discovers that when she awoke from her pill induced sleep, her hand was holding the knife that was in her lovers back! As the plot thickens the reader is drawn into a web of unexpected surprises! A very, very entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Innocent Journey","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms Natsuki. I've all her novels, some are translated into Chinese and others in English. The 'Innocent Journey' I read was in Chinese.The plot of this story was full of twists as usual. Yoko's psychology was described in detail, from her own suicidal nature to her feeling of her lover, Sato (to suicide with him) and later her eagerness to find out his killer and at the same time, chased after by cops. This is the typical style of Ms Natsuki. She controlled it very well, especially jumping from one scene to another and then joining it back. It was just like 'watching a movie in my head'.However, this book was written in the 70's. From today's point of view, some of the reasonings behind could not stand. I'm not giving anything out to spoil other readers' appetite.Anyhow, I would prefer 'The Third Lady' than 'Innocent Journey'."},{"Title":"Emperor Shaka the Great: A Zulu Epic (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works African Authors Series)","review":"This book is unique among many others in African history. This is the story of Shaka translated directly from Zulu oral history into English. I felt as if I were in the time of Shaka in a way that I never felt from reading other histories of Africa. This book made me realized that my perception of Africa needed looking into. I always approached books about African history as if I were going to a place and time that is inherently alien. Then I read &quot;Shaka,&quot; and because it was the current events, or at least recent history, to the historians of the day, the events and characters are reported as the stories of men and women, and I realized that I was not reading &quot;African&quot; history -- I was reading World history, and there is only one history.This story stands shoulder-to-shoulder with other great first-hand accounts of history and warfare for military accuracy (not that I've attempted to re-trace the route of Shaka's campaigns for accuracy!): the Pelopennesian War, the Punic Wars, the campaigns of Napoleon.This history, insofar as it is verbal and just happened to be transcribed, is also a very long poem, and the instances of poetic adornment are many, but bear them! for they are as much a part of the story as what they describe. And don't skip over the reflections on the application of the power of the king and political philosophy. For the non-African, these are essential to beginning to understand African (or at least Zulu) aesthetics and philosophy.A must-read (not just a must-OWN, by the way) for the casual student or scholar of history, African or otherwise."},{"Title":"Emperor Shaka the Great: A Zulu Epic (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works African Authors Series)","review":"Mazisi Kunene's penchant for history is alive in this collection.

Inspiring!!--Dike Festus OkoroMilwaukee, WI USA"},{"Title":"Emperor Shaka the Great: A Zulu Epic (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works African Authors Series)","review":"Mazisi Kunene, the great Zulu Poet, relates the story of Emperor Shaka from various oral sources. This is an excellent read and very enlightening account of the Shakan times."},{"Title":"Emperor Shaka the Great: A Zulu Epic (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works African Authors Series)","review":"Sadly, this work is out of print. But if you can find a copy, it is well worth your time, particularly if you enjoy epic poetry. While it does not quite rival Homer or Virgil, it is easily superior to such works as The Song of Roland, El Cid, T&aacute;in B&oacute; C&uacute;alnge, or The Nibelungenlied, and therefore deserves a much wider audience.The introduction provides an informative summary of Shaka's life, ambitions, military innovations, and political achievements. It also provides a brief discussion of the Zulu oral tradition in transmitting stories.The story itself covers Shaka's entire life, including the prophecy of his birth and rise to greatness; his illegitimate birth; his lonely childhood in exile; his rise as a creative and innovative soldier; his eventual kingship; his numerous battles to rid his lands of outlaws, to build an empire, and to stabilize Zululand; his dealings with white settlers; his internal struggles with jealous familial rivals; and his tragic assassination.Kunene's language is superb. It is artful, colorful, and lively. The imagery is always strong, and the characters are vivid and memorable. Kunene is as his finest when he meditates on the nature of ambition, power, obligation, and doubt. His reflections on human nature are what elevate the poem from a cultural artifact to a story of universal importance. Kunene really knows his craft. Like all good writers, he shows us that people have the same cares and motivations everywhere, regardless of time, place, and culture.To me, the work suffers somewhat from its frequent \\"praise poems.\\" Hardly a page goes by where someone isn't \\"singing Shaka's epics\\" or \\"reciting poems of Shaka's excellence.\\" They add little to the work, except to emphasize their importance to Zulu culture. Perhaps sensing how they bog down the story, Kunene's introduction mentions that praise poems are an essential part of Zulu culture, and their inclusion was necessary to preserve the flavor of the original Zulu oral epics. He also points out that he edited them liberally to make them more accessible to Western readers. Be that as it may, the praise poems add a lot of filler without greatly enhancing the story. I read all of them carefully, thinking they might be important to the story, but only a few actually were.It would have been nice if the introduction included a technical discussion of Zulu poetry. I'm curious how Kunene structured the poem in the original Zulu, and what challenges he had in rendering them into English. As it stands, we have no understanding of how the original epic was structured.Even so, this is a marvelous work. It is worth reading simply for the poetic language and the razor-sharp insights into human nature. The bonus is that Shaka is a character worthy of an epic. He was a titan among men. When you read his story, you get a great sense of what the Zulu civilization was like at its peak, under a brilliant, ambitious, and charismatic leader. Read it, and learn why the Zulus still sing Shaka's praises."},{"Title":"A Grammar of the German Language","review":"This is an excellent grammar, but beware which edition you purchase.

Whether you buy this book for real life instruction or just to stimulate great conversation with family and friends, you can't go wrong with the investment. The rules, which are presented in an incredibly humorous fashion, cover almost every situation that can occur in a modern household. For example: Rule #9: Never whistle while you pack - This is because leaving home on a business trip is not supposed to be more fun than staying home with your wife. Rule #20: Allow your wife to talk twice as much as you. She knows that you only listen to half of what she says.

The book reveals common mistakes men make in their marriage, although sincerely desiring to please their wives. The irony, I experienced when reading the book, was due to the fact that I had broken many of the rules early in marriage.

Two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, according to Baskin (and her footnoted sources) lives underground, \\"the most diverse and abundant web of life known in the universe.\\"Baskin introduces us to a few of these creatures - nematodes earthworms, slime molds, fungi, water bears - and takes us to frozen tundra, wetlands, forests and seabeds where they live.And she introduces us to the people who study them. People like the Wormherders of Antarctica who study nematodes (tiny worms), the most abundant animal on the planet. They study them in Antarctica because it's the one place in the world where if you change something in the soil, or remove one species, you can see the effect. Antarctica is the only place on earth where you can pick up a handful of soil and possibly not find nematodes.Cindy Hale studies earthworms in the forests of Minnesota - a place where there aren't supposed to be any earthworms. Marine biologist Melanie Austen measures nutrient recycling on the ocean floor and the effect of fishing draggers on the tiny living recyclers. And Renata Outerbridge and Tony Trofymow show how selective tree cutting can help the loggers as well as the forest.The creatures themselves are fascinating, not least because of the intricacy and complexity of their interaction with their crowded environment. Like the symbiotic relationship of fungi and tree roots, which involves antibiotics and decay as well as nutrient sharing, and without which, in a sever clear-cut, for instance, trees can never thrive.These creatures are also stranger than anything we see above ground. Nematodes have a gene structure which seems to fit them for survival anywhere on earth and when conditions are inhospitable they dry themselves out and go dormant, for decades if need be. No one has yet determined the upper level of a nematode's ability to revive from a dehydrated state.Earthworms, hermaphrodites the world over (many capable of self-fertilizing), are not always the \\"beneficial\\" creatures we think them. It wasn't until 1995 that scientists discovered earthworms are not native to forests and don't belong there. There are no native worms in the upper US and exotics, long beloved of gardeners, are disrupting the \\"thrifty\\" nutrient recycling of forests.Baskin (\\"A Plague of Rats and Rubbervines: The Growing Threat of Species Invasions\\") accompanies each of these scientists (and more) on their rounds, showing us their work and enthusiasm as well as explaining the ecology involved as human acts start unseen chain reactions. Her writing is fair and balanced, pointing out the unknown and documenting her research with copious notes at the end of the book. Accessible and enjoyable, this is a book for ecologists and anyone curious about the world we walk on."},{"Title":"Under Ground: How Creatures of Mud and Dirt Shape Our World","review":"Under Ground: How Creatures Of Mud And Dirt Shape Our World focuses on soil and the creatures which evolve from there to shape our lives: from worms in a Minnesota forest which are making the soil too rich for wildflowers to mud-dwelling animals on the ocean floor, and soil microbes affecting both wilderness areas and gardens.

Her recall of simple, yet difficult memories are woven throughout her story. Readers will share along with the author, the feelings this young woman felt along her decision-making path. I would describe this book as inspirational and hope giving for a world filled with so much tradegy and despair. The author's choice at a time so filled with remorse and sorrow is rewarded with love and new lives, she could not imagine.

I want to send a special copy to my daughter (the birth mother), the adoptive parents of her child, as well as to my mother, because I think it's a book we can all relate to as a way of understanding what we've gone through these past 7 months. We have an &quot;open adoption&quot; so can see/write/talk to each other whenever we want. It's amazing to even imagine what it would have been like 20 or 30 years ago; we have much to be thankful for. But that doesn't take away from the losses that everyone brings to the adoptive table. Everything about the book was enjoyable--even the cover of the book, a soft pastel/water color print of violets, was pleasing to look at. And I loved all the quotes from those great songs of the 60's and 70's (with a few earlier ones thrown in)!"},{"Title":"The Bridge Of Faith: Access To The Kingdom Of God","review":"\\"The Bridge of Faith\\" presents the essentials of the Christian faith not simply as a well researched, well understood and well expressed account but as a testimony of what the author strives to assimilate and live as completely as possible. The book's chapters in effect follow the outline of the articles of the Apostles' Creed as they lay out the fundamental Christian tenets of creation, the fall, the Incarnation, the redemptive suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ultimate hopes of Christian believers.The faith that opens up these vistas of the Christian reality is portrayed as a bridge that one crosses, with the grace of God, from a self-contained, indeed self-centered, world to a transcendent Reality Who invites to \\"glad tidings of good things\\". Displaying an impressive and uncommon familiarity with Scripture, the author generously cites relevant Biblical passages, interwoven with what amounts to a well thought out and thought-provoking commentary on Scripture. His treatment explains and brings to life the tenets of Christian faith in a way that relates them to real life and calls for them to be taken seriously today.The Scriptural citations and the author's commentary complement each other in that both speak strongly, pointedly and without wasting a word about the basic realities of human existence. He does not gloss over such problems as the meaning of suffering to which he devotes a chapter, and the significance of sin and repentance. In this connection, the author insists on the role of human freedom, a subject he has remarkably treated in another work, \\"The Choices Are Yours\\". Another chapter contains an amazingly clear and comprehensive synopsis of the genesis and status of the divisions among Christians.Perhaps the most moving pages of the book are those devoted to a description of what it means to be born again. They paint a warmly inspiring picture of what a real Christian can be. The author's final words to the reader come from the beautiful prayer found in the conclusion of the Epistle to the Hebrews. \\"The Bridge of Faith\\" is a profound and moving work of mind and heart that commends itself to every Christian, regardless of denomination."},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"Walter Kaufmann, you are missed. In this age where intellectuals and academics seem able to justify their lives and works solely by how confusing or intimidating they are, Kaufmann's work are respite, reprieve, and sanctuary.Sometimes I feel like the post-modern intellectual ferment is a phenomenon akin to Medieval Scholasticism (how many angels can dance on the head of a pin)- the rampantly tendentious obscurantism, the impenetrable jargon and idiotic linguistic play of theoretical discourse... If only Kaufamnn where here to call these post-modern charlatans (who all-too often pillage Kaufmann's intellectual and spiritual predecessor, Nietzsche) out on their empty sophistry... As always, I'm getting off topic.This book is an exemplary work of scholarship- aproachable, insightful, clear, interesting, at times humorous, and unencumbered. It is so good and so readable it is at odds with our age. Kaufmann analyses not only the major tragedians of antiquity (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides) but also the commentators of antiquity- Plato and Aristotle, calling them on their glaring faults and presumptions. It takes serious [courage] (or it used to) to go messing with the two Grecian heavy-weights of western thought but Kaufamnn is up to the challenge. One walks away from the first half of the book STEEPED in ideas.Kaufamnn also examines Shakespearian Tragedy. Then he discusses the theories of both Nietzsche and Hegel as regards both tragedy and Greek culture in general. This, in my opinion is where Kaufmann truly shines, as a brilliant commentator on German philosophy and literature. (His book on Hegel was the first to enable me to understand Hegel, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly). He knows Nietzsche like the back of his hand and has the ability to call ol' Fritz out when he falls prey to his own style, the shrill and willful naysaying. He is highly fond of Nietzsche but is also not an acolyte (the greatest disservice one can do to a thinker as profound as Nietzsche is to be a disciple and nothing more, and Nietzsche himself never tired of stating that), Kaufmann possessed a head level enough to work through N's thought and avoid his missteps (Nietzsche, for example, points the finger at Euripides for the fall of tragedy. Kaufmann disagrees and clearly believes that the form continued on through other historical epochs, but not our own).Still, despite his differences, Kaufmann finds much in both Nietzsche and Hegel that is worthwhile and illuminating, and he delivers to the reader not only a thorough comprehension of both thinker's perceptions of tragedy, but also a capacity to root both men in their historical context, so that one has a sense of WHY they thought and wrote as they did. Don't underestimate that.He finally posits his own 'ironic' theory of tragedy against those of the thinkers he has perused and analysed (This is not surprising, as Kaufmann's first and highest devotion, philosophically was to the ever-ironic Socrates). He also discusses why our age has been unable live up to the art of those who have come before, and why (in his opinion) our age has produced no fully realized tragedies of its own (though a few have tried... perhaps the form and all its particulars is no longer relevant, like epic poetry- it can be studied and of course enjoyed for its sublime nature, but to attempt to create one would be a farsical endeavor??? I'm just wondering aloud so to speak...) He briefly looks at Sartre's 'The Flies,' in connection with Euripides and doesn't fault JP too much. I'm very fond of that play and my copy of the book is underlined almost the whole way through on this chapter.I can't think of any other text on tragedy (or even drama in general) that does so much for the reader. Why can't all writers and scholars be this concise, enthralling and well-learned?I'll end by repeating: the finest book on tragedy and thought I have come across."},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"Finding this book on ... search engine was a pleasant surprise, the book now in paperback. There are not many good books, apart from literary criticism of individual works, attempting to analyze the phenomenon of tragedy, whose very definition is subject to an almost metaphysical confusion. Kaufmann's work is especially significant since, as the translator and commentator of Nietzsche's famous work, he also provides a corrective to the inspired but misleading views of that brilliant thinker. The view of tragedy emerging from some preposterous cult or ritual of the goat, and like theories, have been laid to rest by recent scholarship, which Kaufmann cites. The question of the birth and death of tragedy is great historical riddle and defies easy analysis, as is the attempt to find the common denominator between its short list of examplars. The great age of the Greek tragedians is subject to many misperceptions, such as among them the idea that Aeschylus, a bit of an optimist, invented the tragic view of life, etc... Nietzsche's attempt to blame Euripides for the 'death of tragedy' is shown to be somewhat misleading, while the reaction of Plato and the birth of philosophy in its wake remains a forever ambiguous advance.Kaufmann's 'steady as she goes' scholarship assembles a host of interesting issues and digressions, from the Poetics of Aristotle to the great interpretation of tragedy by Hegel, based on Antigone. Kaufmann's ironic view of philosophy, born in the same time and litter as the genre of the tragedians, is an additional twist, with a somewhat acerbic conclusion that should put philosophers to a double take. Finally, the strange inability of modern drama to grasp the essentials, let alone continue this tradition, throws a great question mark on the universal history from which tragedy is born, and the mechanical history during which it cannot survive. The work might be complemented by George Steiner's The Death of Tragedy."},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"Princeton's own Walter Kaufmann has devised another book that fits a central category of his lifelong interest: the nexus between philosohy and art. More specifically, he engages that topic of philospohy and its relationship to tragedy.Being a philosopher, one would think that Kaufmann would write a book of literary criticism that is somewhat condescending to the poets. He does no such thing. While he does offer some literary criticism, he also uses the paradigms of the poets to go after the philosophers. This is an unexpected approach, and also a unique one.One cannot read one of Kaufmann's books without admiring his erudition. It's not just a matter of his knowing his material but knowing it inside & out. His scholarship can be downright intimidating at times. This fact may serve as a warning for those considering this book to become at least somewhat familiar with its subject matter before delving into Kaufmann.That said, Kaufmann is not for everyone. He is not one to pull any punches when it comes to artists and scholars whom he does not care for. He has been known to launch intellectual uppercuts from his books. This aggressive style may not be appreciated by all readers.If you are interested in tragedy and the history of tragedy, then this book is for you. Kaufmann traces it from the ancient Greeks to the modern age. He discusses the different paradigms and literary theory of philosophers down the ages. In short, this book details everything you ever wanted to know about the genre - and then some!"},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"Walter Kaufmann has a wonderful prose style-lucid, pithy, and even witty. Consequently, this book will be a pleasant and enlightening read even if you are only minimally familiar with the dramatists and philosophers that Kaufmann brings together in this work.Kaufmann starts from the basic premise that to know what tragedy is one must examine the tragedies themselves. Any theory that can not account for all of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes & Shakespeare's tragedies is not sound-and he appears to be the first to really hold the theories of Plato, Socrates, Neitzsche, Hegel and other philosophers to this standard. But Kaufmann is not merely a nay-sayer; in the process he develops his own theory. (It's soundness you must judge for yourself!)I would recommend that the prospective reader have a little familiarity with Greek and Shakespearian tragedy-ideally Sophocles' Oedipus the King and Antigone, Aeschylus' The Oresteia, and two or three of Shakespeare's tragedies. One of Kaufmann's key points is that the plot and characterization of tragedy takes many forms, and it will help if you can reflect on this yourself, instead of having to take him at his word. A background in aesthetic philosophy is quite unnecessary. However much you go into this book with, I think you will come out eager to read more."},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"A book rich in its analysis of western tragedy starting with the Greeks. Some excellent chapters on Shakespeare particularly. Target audience should be those with an interest in Nietzschean or Shakespearean will-to-power themes.

Both these books are about what a tragic farce human life can be, but they are written with humor and respect for the human spirit. Really a fantastic book, but obviously not for those looking for a light read on the beach while on vacation from the corporate lifestyle!

Es realmente notable la claridad, la erudici&oacute;n y la amplitud de la informaci&oacute;n presentada por el autor. Este libro resulta una gu&iacute;a luminosa para comprender la tragedia. Resulta adem&aacute;s muy bien escrito (la traducci&oacute;n al espa&ntilde;ol publicada por Seix Barral en 1978 es tambi&eacute;n excelente). Desde Plat&oacute;n y Arist&oacute;teles (de quien examina algunos de los t&eacute;rminos m&aacute;s importantes expuestos en La Po&eacute;tica), hasta Nietzche y Sartre este ensayo enriquece en cada p&aacute;gina nuestra comprensi&oacute;n de la tragedia, no solo como g&eacute;nero literario y dram&aacute;tico sino como visi&oacute;n de la realidad. Un espl&eacute;ndido trabajo."},{"Title":"Tragedy and philosophy, (Anchor Books)","review":"First off this book helped me greatly with my BA in English Literature. Anyone studying Dramatic Lit will benefit from reading this. If your getting a degree in philosophy this book will help you make connections between Aristotle, Socrates, Nietzsche, and Sartre. As a fan of Sartre's, \\"The Flies\\" this book greatly helped me to understand something I thought I already did.If you despise Nietzsche don't buy this because by reading it one can tell Kaufmann was quite fond of the tragic philosopher--even though he disputes Nietzsche's belief that Euripides caused the death of tragedy. If your a complete advocate of Rationalism don't buy this unless you truely believe the unexamined life isn't worth living. Only buy this if like a good argument, no matter what side is right, and enjoy a deep analysis of the human condition."},{"Title":"How to Go to Therapy: Making the Most of Professional Help","review":"I recently discovered this gem. Many people don't know what questions to ask when seeking a therapist; they often aren't sure of their rights, nor how to detect unscrupulous behavior. (Unfortunately, human nature affects this profession too, and there are occasional &quot;bad eggs&quot; hanging out their shingles.) This guide provides concise, clear information on the types of provider qualifications and available therapies.The book begins by defining what psychotherapy is and how to determine if one needs therapy. The author explores some of the myths about what therapy does and the societal pressures against asking for help. The next chapter provides descriptions of the various professionals -- psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors -- and the numerous national and local organizations which provide listings. The author then moves on to describe the rules of therapy: what to expect in terms of confidentiality, social interaction, time, planning treatment, and sex (a therapist should never have sex with client (or former client), and you should report any therapist who attempts to). The impact and findings of research are briefly explored. Then the author devotes a chapter each to several major theories by which counselors practice: psychoanalysis &amp; psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, group, couples, and family therapy; he explains the philosophical underpinnings of the orientation and some of the techniques therapists use. He then discusses biological psychiatry and the use of medication, and provides suggestions for making the decision. The last few chapters cover alternative kinds of therapy, advice on how to set goals and stay on track, paying for therapy and using insurance, and bringing therapy to a close. An appendix provides a brief guide to diagnosis (such as what symptoms describe anxiety disorder, depression, and addictions) as well as an extensive list of references and website resources.The author, Carl Sherman, is a freelance writer who has written about mental health issues for almost twenty years. His work has been published in national publications, such as Psychology Today, Family Circle, Us, GQ, and Investor's Business Daily. He writes a column and contributes articles to Clinical Psychiatry News. Mr. Sherman has organized his accumulated knowledge and experience in a highly readable manner, making it an accessible and friendly guide to counseling. This book is a necessary resource for clients and therapists alike."},{"Title":"How to Go to Therapy: Making the Most of Professional Help","review":"This seems to me to be a pretty standard exposition of how to choose a therapist. It may work for an average client. The author agrees that therapists are different in their success with therapy, but as with many another on the topic does not really know why. What does one therapist do in therapy that another does not? Why does one therapist actively listen, immediately aware of his or her own thoughts and feelings during a session and able to make use of this awareness, and another just goes on \\"instinct\\" without being particularly self-aware? This can be the crucial difference in therapy. It allows a therapist to let a client be entirely separate from the therapist, and lets him or herself hear the experience of the client, an experience which may be very much more extreme than the average person's -- and this factor is almost never discussed."},{"Title":"Congressmen and their constituencies (Rand McNally political science series)","review":"while this may an older book, being published back in 1963, it still has several fundamental ideas that can be applied today. While reading Lewis A. Froman's book, Congressmen and Their Constituencies, I learned about voting behaviours and the relationship between elected officials and their districts. The book cna be seen as separated into two specific sections. The first focuses on narrow studies that determine voting behaviours, while the second half applies these views. Froman was able to describe the congress and voting behaviours through studies, however outdated they currently are."},{"Title":"Kingdom of God: Our Best Hope","review":"This is an intriguing encounter for the reader's prior understanding of the Kingdom of God, or first experience. The author takes a step-by-step historical approach to describing God's workings in, and ultimate purpose for the world. Familiar biblical terms are given fresh exegetical analysis. Despite one's own theological location, this book will take you down a road worth traveling."},{"Title":"Cook Japanese","review":"This is a great cookbook from 1964. There are no fusion techniques, no photos of dishes that you could never match at home, and really no bells and whistles.So what does it have?Real Japanese cooking that is simple and practical to prepare and serve. Its an old Japanese cookbook so the recipes haven't been changed or localized for Western tastes.Here's what is has.Chapters onParty FoodAppetizersEgg DishesRice DishesFishChickenBeefPorkGround MeatDessertsand small sections in the back on origami, basic sauce recipes, and a short glossary.It starts off with what is generally viewed as everyone's favorite, Sukiyaki.The recipe is on one page and a photo of two people cooking and eating Sukiyaki is on the other page. When you viewed both, you get a complete picture.Each recipe follows the same pattern.The name, followed by a brief introduction, ingredients, Untensils and equipment, method, and variations.This book covers a wide variety of Japanese recipes such as yakitori to takara-mushi (pumpkin soup served inside a small Japanese pumpkin.)The photos actually help in this cookbook. They show the many different types of plates to use, as well as, how to garnish each dish. Of coarse you can add your own artistic touches but its still nice to get an idea of presentation.There are a few recipes missing that I love like Hiroshima Okonomiyaki and Unagi-don and all the different don buri. Still, you do get a nice selection.The author is Doi Masaru from Shikoku who studied at the nearby Osaka Cooking school. He was a chef for the Japanese Navy during World War II. After that he stated the Kansai Kappo Gakuin (which has changed its name to Doi Masaru Ryori Gakko (Doi Mararu's Cooking School.)This is a nice little compact hardcover book published by Kodansha International and it won the International Kochkunst Ausstellung Prize.I think that anyone who wants to start cooking Japanese food should take a look at this book. Its not as thorough as Tsuji's Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art, is more of a introduction."},{"Title":"If this is a man: Remembering Auschwitz","review":"This is an older edition (1986 Summit Books Book Club Edition) which compiles 3 volumes of Primo Levi's work about the Holocaust, i.e. Survival in Auschwitz, The Reawakening, and Moments of Reprieve. \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\" (1947) recounts Primo Levi's personal experiences during the 10 months he spent in Auschwitz. \\"The Reawakening\\" (1963) narrates his journey after liberation. In both works, what struck me as amazing was the absence of self-pity. Instead, Levi writes with fervor and the dark (and there's plenty of that) is offset by the rare tinges of humor. The Nazis' mission to completely dehumanize their incarcerated prisoners and exterminate the Jews is well-documented. Also compelling are accounts of how survival could sometimes be determined by the strangest circumstances and coincidences and where the presence of fear, pain,mortality, and uncertainty is always prevalent.\\"Moments of Reprieve\\" (1979) is a collection of stories about some of the characters that made an impression on Levi during those dark years. How did Levi recall these people and their stories more than 30 years after the war? The author addresses this in his foreword to \\"Moments of Reprieve\\". I am glad to have all three volumes in one work (the only copy I had previously was \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\") and it goes without saying that Levi's works describing his Holocaust experiences are a must-read in the annals of Holocaust literature."},{"Title":"Arabians","review":"Unusual gorgeous photos of Arabian horses. This is a nice large book, well worth the price. Also history of the breed."},{"Title":"Arabians","review":"I bought this for my daughter, who has an Arabian horse. It is a beautiful book and the pictures of the horses are fantastic. The history of the Arabian is informative and interesting. Anyone who loves horses, especially Arabians, would love this book."},{"Title":"Arabians","review":"i love the great pictures of these beautiful horses, and the text actually tells alot, where most books give alot of info you dont need."},{"Title":"Arabians","review":"In my opinion, this book is the best book that has been written on the Arabian horse to date. The author takes you to the source of those that created the Arabian breed. Along the journey, the author gives a thorough review of the Arabian horse. He starts with the history of the desert breed Arabian and explains how the Arabian was imported to different parts of the world. The lineage of some of the most important Arabian horses to influence the breed is discussed and often traces those Arabians back to the desert tribe from where they originated. The author examins the Arabian based on what the desert tribes value as important to the success of the breed in the harsh desert environment. Then the author takes you on a trip around the world to explore the different types of Arabian horses. He travels from tribe to tribe, and country to country, showing off some of the world's best equines. The photography is superb and captures the essence of the Arabian. This is one book that should be in every Arabian horse lover's library."},{"Title":"Arabians","review":"I own two Arabian horses and have many books but this is by far the best I have ever seen.
