Though written in the 1940s this book still has a lot to say about our culture vis-a-vis death today. A quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"There is something to be said about the humorous dance macabre and Mr. Waugh, in this brief book weaves an interesting tale of a love triangle farce punctuated by death and cynical humor. Not for the happily-ever-after crowd, but well worth a weekend read, if only for the punchline ending."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"although i am not an avid reader, this book gave me an interst in reading . this book is not for the young ones (pg-13). it is for mature audiences. final comments : i thought the beginning was dull at first , but as i read on i started to enjoy it. this was a good combination of laughter and strong emotions played by the characters."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I felt that this book gave an excellent account on the people of Hollywood and how it can affect them and the people around them. The story itself gave great detail on Hollywood life and gave insight into the industries that are there. I think people would like this story due to the fact that Evelyn Waugh made the story somewhat real.While reading the story, I began learning about the funeral industry and the many aspects of it. The thing that I found interesting is that you get the point of view from a pet cemetary and a cemetary for the people of Hollywood. I felt that this story was a little frightening, but then again it was like a twisted comedy.Overall, I liked this book very much because from a certain perspective it seemed like it was real. I would recommend this book to many of my friends."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is full of commedy and drama. This book pokes fun at Forest Lawn, Holywood, and rich English snobishness. This book is great to take a day off and read by the fire. This book is a definite 4 out of 5 stars and a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that the book was good. It is kind of hard to read because the writer uses a lot of adjectives. That also makes the book more interesting because you have to pay attention more. The book has many characters that are very well discribed, it really paints a picture in your head. Another thing I like about is the ending. I think that enyone who reads it will enjoy it, young or old."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is a very much a satire of the L.A. funeral industry, at which Dennis Barlow is made to confront because his long time English comrade and roomate Sir Francis Hinsley commits suicide after being fired from a Hollywood movie studio in which he had worked at for a long time. Whispering Glades, a cemetery for the stars is where he comes to bury his long time friend. Their he falls in love with a cosmetician for the dead stars. There's a twist to this humor, but once you pick up the book you just cant stop reading. But for first time Waugh readers you'll be glad you decided this book."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is a great one for taking a day off and reading. It is full of rich comedy and drama as it pokes fun at Hollywood, Forrest Lawn, the English, and the Americans. Through all the comedy it really gives the reader a feel of Southern California. This book is really a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that this story was very bland and at times a bit indescribable. It showed that every person had their own little world in which they meditated and thought that the world revolves around them, dealing with their own, and only their own problems. In the end practically all three of the people were at a loss. The english-man had lost a fiance and a career in america. Mr. Joyboy had also lost his fiance, as well as a life for having the thought that people would accuse him of murder. Both having Ms. Thanatogenos as their fiance. And Ms. Thanatogenos losing her life and both men that she loved."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I enjoyed reading this interesting book by Evelyn Waugh. She did an excellent job on the words that she used describing the characters and their moods. At first it was sort of difficult for me to understand but then I started to catch up on what was going on.All of the characters in which Waugh created did an excellent job of making this novel start to smooth out and make it easier to understand.In my opinion Hollywood is a place where there are a lot of movie stars and tourists who go visit there and have a good time.I never heard of it being like some haunted place that many terrible things happen there such as many great people dying.I would recommend this novel to many other people out there who enjoy the type of plot that Evelyn Waugh had set it to be.I myself enjoyed it and I was thrilled to have a chance to write a report on this novel."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that The Loved One was not a novel of humorous display but of dry humor. It was a grim love story between a Britsh poet and an American crematorium cosmetician. Throughout the novel there were horrible acts of violence which made the plot of a love story more interesting. In my point of view the book could have had more humorous displays. The reason I gave it three stars was because there were many boring parts throughout the book. Due to these boring parts it loses your interest in the book. But all in all it was somewhat of an appealing book."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is a hilarious story of what happens to your loved ones when it is time to put them to their resting place. The arrangements that are made by the funeral staff and what they do makes one amused to keep on reading the book. They turn death into a stand up comedy. I recomend you to read this book as your #1 selection in comedy and tragedy. How the author of this book mixes the elements of joy and death makes this book so unique and funny. The characters play in this book marvelous as if they have their own minds in their own world. The ending of this book is unexpected and suprisingly good. All I can say is read it."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I think I want to start a fan site called &quot;I love Ralph&quot;. Ralph has got to be one of the most real and endearing characters I've come across in a long time. James F. David has a particular talent for creating memorable characters with depth. This book caught my attention right away and held it until the end. I couldn't put it down! If you enjoy mystery twisted with the paranormal, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"&quot;Fragments&quot; is a story about a group of diverse savants who are brought together for a remarkable experiment - to take each of their gifts (ranging from eidetic imagery to unbelievable mathematic computation) and meld them into one &quot;super-human&quot; personality. Sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it? That's what I thought too when I picked this book up. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't quite live up to expectations.For the most part, David &quot;delivers&quot; by creating some interesting characters (in particular, the savants), but the plot (and ANY believability) begins to lose steam in the last 200 pages of the book. This happens when the ghost of a young girl, who took her revenge against a group of college fraternity boys by murdering them 60 years ago, suddenly returns to finish the job by &quot;working&quot; through the savants &quot;super-personality&quot;.The other major flaw in this novel (IMHO) is the relationship between the two major characters, Wes and Elizabeth. It's clumsy and sophomoric and takes away from the plot. It's almost as if David felt like he needed just to throw something else into the mix. As a matter of fact, the &quot;Wes&quot; character isjust plain annoying. It's hard to imagine how such a &quot;whiner&quot; could become a scientist of his stature. He is shown as a petty and rather immature individual who cares little for the savants and their needs.The ending is rather pedestrian and comes to a pretty abrupt halt. But, by that point, I think David was probably ready for this book to end as well.James F. David appears to be a promising author based on what I read in &quot;Fragments&quot;. There are a few flaws that I think he will be able to work out as he creates more plots and characters. I haven't read his first book, &quot;Footprints of Thunder&quot; or his latest, &quot;Before the Cradle Falls&quot;, but I think he shows enough potential to give them both a try."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I tend to agree with some of the other reviewers about this book. I felt that the so-called romance between Wes &amp; Elizabeth, to be shallow &amp; contrived. I enjoyed the characterization of Ralph better, he seemed more real. The plot itself was interesting, but I think Mr. David's main defect is the inabilty to create flesh &amp; blood characters. It's too bad, because I think if you could feel like the characters were more real, it would make the book more enjoyable. Not to say it's not entertaining, which it was, but I felt that it could have been much better.Towards the end of the book I was so annoyed with Wes &amp; his stupidity that I was beginning to wonder how this guy ever became such a great scientist. His character definitely needed improvement."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"\\"Fragments\\" offers an interesting concept, the fusing of the minds of several savants in a collective intelligence. However, a concept is not enough to sustain a book.In my opinion, the problem with \\"Fragments\\" is a basic one. The reader never really gets to know, or care about, the characters in the story. Part of the problem may be that there are too many characters to keep track of. In any case, the people we meet in this book are never really fleshed out.I think James David has some potential as a horror/thriller author. I think he just needs to refine his writing a bit first."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I'm not sure I'm willing to place James F. David among the ranks of such great suspence novelists such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Dan Simmons or even F. Paul Wilson. While his second novel, FRAGMENTS, starts off rather quickly and often grabs the reader by surprise, the plot seems to run consistantly thin throughout the story. Even the editing is handicapped as it turns the novel from a Hardy Boys episode (the dialogue often sounds out of date) into a bloody gore-fest straight from the likes of &quot;Hellraiser.&quot;Maybe I've missed something, after all the idea behind the story is pretty original. This could possibly be the first ghost story/paranormal/medical thriller of our time (think: &quot;Coma&quot; meets &quot;Rainman&quot; meets &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; meets &quot;Carrie&quot;). But I definitely felt a lack of connection to any of the characters, found the suggestive love interest between the two leads (Wes and Elizabeth) forced and unnecessary, and Gil (the bad guy) to be an oxymoron of himself (described as a character who never experiences anger yet needs that exact emotion in order to unleash his powers). And not one of the savant characters ever felt truly &quot;real.&quot;Like a poorly written episode of &quot;The X-Files,&quot; FRAGMENTS left me with unresolved feelings and with a lot to be explained. My recommendation is to pick up David's first novel, FOOTPRINTS OF THUNDER, as it's definitely more of an entertaining read."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"This is a book that grabs you from the first moment--I read in in two non-stop sitting. It is a fabulous book UNTIL, you get to the ending. The book literally just stops and the reader is left wondering what in the heck is happening. There is no explantion as to what was going on with the characters. The books stops so suddenly I actually thought there were pages missing from my copy--but no such luck. What happened--did the author just run out of story or was he late for his deadline so just stopped!!! A great book but was left with a bad taste of disappointment in my mouth at the end."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"The X-Files meets Rainman is how the book is described on the back, and that pretty much nails this storyline to a 'T'. A truly original story which centers around the idea of taking the ultra-genius talents that certain savants possess (incredible memory, solving puzzles, knowing calendar dates from centuries in the past and into the future etc.) and combining them to create an artificial intelligence that can think on different planes than an average human can...but it is more than that, much more. From the opening scenes of 'Fragments' you read about a father and daughter with a most unusual relationship and the unique way the father decides to deal with it. Now at first I wondered what it all had to do with the savants, but never fear, Mr. David ties the loose ends together in a very clever way that turns it from an above-average para-normal story to a murder-mystery with a taste of the X-Files thrown in for good measure.One of the best things about 'Fragments' was the character of Ralph. You just cannot help but like this mentally challenged goliath with a taste for Slurpees and his perpetually happy moods. He adds a separate dimension to the storyline and his place in the story becomes very interesting towards the end. Personally I enjoyed how the mystery deepened when the murders began and how they were eerily similar to ones that had occurred years ago in the same town...a serial murderer who was never caught, too. Could the latest killings be done by the same person? Finding out is a journey that is both fun &amp; rewarding. If you are searching for a completely unique fun story with supernatural undertones, I submit that 'Fragments' is the book you have been looking for. Oh, and for those who came to love Ralph, he makes a return appearance in Mr. David's 3rd book, 'Ship of the Damned' (another winner). Good stuff from an original author."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"Grabs you from the very beginning. I couldn't put it down! The story has unique twists and the characters are interesting."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I couldn't put the book down! I had a big project due, butinstead of working on it, I spent the entire weekend reading thisnovel. I was kept guessing until the very end! The story is extremely well developed and very well written. (I'd say more but I don't want to give anything away.) From the very beginning I felt attached to the characters. This is one of the best books I've read in a while and as a bookstore manager I read a ton of books!"},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I simply could not put this one down - I read it in two sittings over the course of a weekend. The level of scientific detail is just right - doesn't overwhelm the reader with jargon, but doesn't patronize either. The characters are well-defined and sympathetic. The lead characters play off each other well, reinforcing the age-old science vs. spirituality debate. I wonder if Mr. David has thought about turning this into a screenplay - it reads like a movie as is. Definately worth your time."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"The concept of fusing several savant talents into one &quot;mind&quot; is both original and interesting. Unfortunately, it never really goes anywhere. The set-up is well done. The characters are introduced well. After that, the plot just loses substance.I think the main problem here is that the author couldn't decide where to focus. The book would have been better, and more cohesive, if the focus had been on the experiment and the resulting events. Instead, we get the formulaic romance: They meet, they disagree/argue/misunderstand, they work together, they (apparently) begin a relationship. The whole thing is very forced and quite repetitive. At times, the dialogue reads like an old teen-gothic romance. Distracting.As others have noted, the ending is quite abrupt. It leaves the reader feeling that either something was left out, or that the author just ran out of things to say.This is the first book I've read by James David. I believe this is only his second novel. The concepts are there. If the storytelling improves with time, this will be an author to watch."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"Fragments is a very original book with characters that are easy to get to know and get attached to. Dr. Martin and his team have gathered idiot savants from all over the world and experiments combining each amazing talent into one great mind. However, this is being conducted in a house where a young woman was raped and murdered, here soul still wandering..."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"Quite simply, this is one of my favorite books of all time. Any time I don't have a new book to read, I drag my already old and haggard copy out and start it all over again. I can't recommend this one enough, all I can say is, if you're reading this review, then you're wasting valuable time that could be put to use reading Fragments."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"has one of the most chilling, creepy beginnings of a book I'ver ever read. Howerever gets a little predictable in some ways, but nice mix of horror, mystery and sci fi. I'd recommend it, and I hope James David keeps writing.. characterizations quirky and believable..read this one!!"},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"James F. David is one of the most under-appreaciated authors out there. Wes Martin, a reseach psychologist, works on an experiment where he brings together the minds of five savants, each with a special talent. He wants to create a one superior being. But the minds are being altered by a spirit of a murdered and raped girl, who wants revenge for her pain. Along comes another specially-gifted, but evil, participant who wants to use the fusage for his own superiority. Great psychological thriller, one you will keep reading till the very end."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"I picked up this book in Tucson at a used bookstore along with about 20 others. I live in San Francisco so large used bookstores don't really exist here. I read this one straight through. Fascinating mix of the supernatural, a ghost story, science, and a little tentative romance. The author weaves a riveting story about a group of savants brought together to scientifically \\"weave\\" their each unique special talents into one new mind, but the experiment is tainted by the presence of the ghost of a girl who had been raped and trapped, and died in the house where the experiments were conducted many years before as well as by a psychically gifted but criminal man who can suggest thoughts to others who is seeking to develop his gifts through the experiments. It reads far too quickly. I can't wait for more from this author."},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"This is one of the most original stories I've read in a long time. The characters are likable (and unlikable) and the premise is really interesting. Perhaps a bit more info on the supernatural presence of &quot;Frankie&quot; would have been nice. I highly recommend this. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Read this book...then go get a Slurpee. (You'll understand after you read the book)"},{"Title":"FRAGMENTS","review":"That about says it all. It's been a very long time since I have read a book that kept my attention enough to read it in two nights, putting it down only when I had to. A story with characters, settings, and emotions that draw you in. A must read for someone looking for a _good_ book."},{"Title":"The Prophet and Other Stories (Jewish Latin America Series)","review":"&quot;The Prophet and Other Stories,&quot; by Samuel Rawet, brings together 12 short stories by this historically important author. The stories have been translated from Portuguese into English by Nelson H. Vieira, who also wrote the introduction.Born in eastern Europe, Rawet (1929-84) emigrated to Brazil as a child. Vieira calls him &quot;the proclaimed pioneer of Brazilian-Jewish writing.&quot; Rawet's stories are moody and introspective. His stories often read like extended prose poems, and his language frequently has an odd, almost hypnotic quality.Rawet writes about the immigrant experience, anti-Semitism, family conflict, and other topics. He takes a modern approach to a figure from Jewish folklore in the story &quot;Johny Golem.&quot; Many of his stories are &quot;metafictions&quot; in which the narrator comments on his own work as a storyteller. If you are interested in Jewish literature or Latin American literature, give this short volume a try. I also recommend the novels and short stories of the excellent Brazilian-Jewish author Moacyr Scliar."},{"Title":"Les provinces romaines d'Europe centrale et occidentale: Evolution et administration du Norique, de la Rhetie, des provinces alpestres, des Gaules, ... J.-C (Histoire ancienne) (French Edition)","review":"This book is very good, don't be fooled by the 4 stars I'm giving. It's a must for academics who want to see painstaking research on how the roman legions were distributed, about the germanic \\"limes\\" and about the administration and institutions in the Central and Ocidental provinces of the Roman Empire. The problem is that sometimes it's extremely dense, like when the author starts naming all the \\"civitates\\" of a province.One very good thing about this \\"essay\\", is the large quantity of very helpful maps with info about the roads, limits, towns, etc, of several roman provinces.Buy and read this book with care if you're really interested (like I am) in the Roman Empire and how it worked. If you're looking for a more general work on the subject, choose another book."},{"Title":"Demon, Wizard and Titan (Gaea Trilogy)","review":"I first read Demon my senior year in high school, having picked it up at my local library, impressed with its girth. Much to my own shock, half way in I couldn't stop and stayed up til the wee hours finishing the book, my first reading marathon of my life, which was REALLY impressive because it's such a LONG book and I'm, sadly, such a slow reader. It is a forage into ideas that I hadn't experienced before, the newness of beings being able to unite with humans and the juxtaposition of archetypes in new ways... and all on a \\"moon\\" that could actually exist (at least in my impressionable mind). I read the first and second books later in college and re-read Demon following. I was still as fascinated with the story as I had been at 17."},{"Title":"The early history of Tennessee: From frontier to statehood","review":"This is an excellent review of the early history of Tennessee.

Tatar doesn't force the interpretations at all. She has spent years in archives looking at the varying editions of the Grimms' tales, and working with materials about life at the time the tales were collected. She's very rigorous in her research, and I think the conclusions she draws are really amazing. Her writing can be dense at times, but not so much so that you can't understand where she's going. This book is more scholarly than popular, but it's well worth reading for fans of the Grimms and other 19th century collections of fairy tales. A great companion to the Zipes editions of the Grimms."},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"Hard Facts of Grimms' Fairy Tales / 0-691-11469-2Like many of us, I am deeply interested in fairy tales and I eagerly anticipated this book, looking forward to an engaging, informative handling of the content and textual analysis of the Grimms' tales, with a focus on the un-\\"child-friendly\\" elements so common in the stories, due to their original intent to entertain mature audiences.Unfortunately, I was profoundly disappointed in this book. Clarity and organization are severely lacking and the whole book feels very much like a hastily expanded dissertation that was haphazardly padded to 'book size'. The writing runs in various different directions, often seemingly at random, with no clear view of why a certain topic was discussed, nor how it led into the next topic.For example, in the first chapter (\\"SEX AND VIOLENCE: The Hard Core of Fairy Tales\\"), Tatar deals very briefly and very superficially on the existence of sex and violence in fairy tales before moving hurriedly on to devote the bulk of the chapter on the Grimms' financial difficulties, publishing woes, irritation over harsh critics, and such varied and dissimilar themes as the differences in vernacular between various editions, the misfortunes of modern compilers who have not had the older, less heavily edited versions available, and authors who failed to realize that the \\"Grimms\\" author were two people, not one. Most of these topics, as the shrewd reader will note, have little or nothing to do with sex or violence in Grimms' fairy tales or any others, so it is deeply unclear why this comprised the bulk of a chapter titled \\"SEX AND VIOLENCE\\".Another flaw in this book pointing to a dissertation source is Tatar's baffling obsession with diagrams. Multiple diagrams are devoted to detailing the difference between \\"fairy\\" tales and \\"folk\\" tales. This was not a topic that interested me whatsoever, and the multitude of pages devoted to it was deeply annoying. What does the difference between a fairy/folk tale have to do with the \\"hard facts\\" of the Grimms' tales? Nothing, as we later find out. It's just something Tatar is interested in, and she hopes we will be, too. Slightly more pertinent is the number of diagrams devoted to detailing the relationships between various story archetypes, but once again, I did not buy this book to learn about the archetypes of fairy tales, but rather to deal with the \\"hard facts\\" of the Grimms' tales - specifically the existence of, explanation for, and critical analysis of the sex, violence, and abandonment in the Grimms' tales, along with the fact that a number of endings were very much \\"happily ever after\\". The lack of serious treatment of these grim topics makes me feel that this book was misnamed in an attempt to drum up sales.I do not think it is appropriate to market a book to an audience expecting analysis and explanation of the content of the Grimms' tales, when the book should more accurately be billed as a \\"history of the publication of the Grimms' tales\\" or \\"an analysis of relationships between archetypal characters in classic fairy/folk tales\\" or something similarly close to the actual content of this book. If you want a book on deconstructing fairy tales in general, this is a decent resource, if somewhat dry. If you want a book on the grim realities of the Grimms' tales, look elsewhere.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"I can't say how long getting this book as been on my mind. I'd tell my friends about this book I've seen, and we'd all giggle, unsure of what it actually was about. Seriously, I thought it was just some lady bashing fairy tales and digging up all the dirt on them.Well, it's certainly the latter, but nothing was bashed. Tatar obviously has done a lot of research in creating this book. Many venerable references were used. Tatar dives into the world of fairy tales; their history, their content, the truth behind them. It is fascinating. I've been aware of some X-rated material behind Disney's works, but my eyes were still opened at the horrors hidden. Now I KNOW why all the *step*-mothers were jealous of the beautiful daughters.A delightful addition were the several tales and prefaces at the back of the book.&quot;The Hard Facts of Grimm's Fairy Tales&quot; is an fascinating, educational book for any student or lover of fairy tales. My one qualm is how Tatar seemed to be doing some name-calling and finger-pointing in several incidents. An unbiased approach would have been better."},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"I have read several of Maria Tatar's books for critical fairy tales analysis.The book is lush with beautiful drawings and the writing style is acutely very good, and very easy to read, and understand.However, I just really wasn't impressed because I had known most of the information that was presented in thisvolume.I acutely would recommend her novel The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales and her up coming book The Annotated Brothers Grimm ( this also looks very interesting. )The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales ( to me at least. ) Would be a good starter point for someone who really wants to know the truth about fairy tales.More recommend for new comers who want's great art work and something easy to read."},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"Ms. Tatar has a dry, somewhat solidly academic style of expression which unfortunately made reading this book a chore, rather than a distinct pleasure (despite its admirable research into the original sources for the tales of the brothers Grimm and the history behind the many revised versions of various tales).While this is an intelligent, informative book, it was 'weighty' when it could have been written with a much lighter touch. I don't mean, in a poking-fun-at-the-subject style, or that Ms. Tatar needed to dumb it down, but just... lighter. Some writers, including academics, have this gift and others just - don't.The (black & white only) illustrations are very good; I particularly liked the ones drawn by Gustave Dore, and could wish there were a few more of these.This book would probably be a very useful source for a college term paper, but as reading material for the ordinary person (like me) with an interest in the facts behind fairy tales... well, in the end, I'm relieved this was a library loan and not a purchase."},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"The book is quite interesting but rather academic.

Includes some genuinely profound insights on the topic. Overall worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales","review":"Maria Tatar's book, while excellent lacks focus. She needs more information in some areas, while in other areas, she needs entirely new sections. It is an excellent book, but you may not find all the information you're looking for. For instance, I was reading the sex and violence section, and she would go on for pages about the sources the Brothers used. While this can pertain to the section title, she strayed to much, and I felt the section was lacking information on sex and violence."},{"Title":"How to Be a Happy Hippo","review":"I recently purchased this book for my daughter. She enjoys the illustrations and I particularly enjoyed the story line. The story is about a young hippo who longs for the attention of his very busy father. It reminds us that a child needs more than toys, food and an abundance of activities -- or in the hippo's case, &quot;mountains of food, lots of things to play with and plenty of mud&quot;. They need the attention of their parents, and in this story, especially the attention of dad. This adorably illustrated story goes through the creative ways a growing hippo tries to &quot;capture&quot; his busy father's attention and the wonderful time they had when he finally succeeded. This is a nice addition to our large library of story books, one both myself and my daughter enjoy."},{"Title":"The Babbitt family history, 1643-1900,","review":"I am glad to have a copy of this book.

Using an interest-holding balance of her own personal experiences and the experiences of her students, former students, and friends, the author enhances and supports the book's main idea that all of us can have joy if we're willing to look inside ourselves. I believe that anyone who takes the time to read this book will agree that the author shared her inner self and her soul with the reader. Doing so, she gives hope to people who feel trapped in a meaningless life and offers encouragement to people who are climbing out of a tough time or a crisis."},{"Title":"The Strength Within: Find Your Life Anchors and Cultivate Habits of Wholeness, Hope, and Joy","review":"What a refreshing read at a great price!

Her earlier book, Picking Up the Pieces, is also very good."},{"Title":"The Strength Within: Find Your Life Anchors and Cultivate Habits of Wholeness, Hope, and Joy","review":"I would like to share with you my appreciation and accolades for Dr. Barbara Hansen's recent release of THE STRENGTH WITHIN. From the first chapter I thought, &quot;Dr. Hansen, this poetry&quot;...The rich elements of personification as she revealed some &quot;lousy&quot; devastating life's experiences of hers and others was so beautifully intertwined. The alliteration of her words was so effective. BUT the VERBS--such as &quot;crunching, marinating, weaving, corroding, splashing, etc.&quot; that are usually used with the forces of nature, she so eloquently wove into her messages to depict the effects of thoughts, feelings, and other inner experiences. That expertise was indubitably my favorite portion of her expert literary mechanics. I was so impressed with the totality of her literary contribution that I purchased twenty-three of her books to give to special loved-ones and colleagues on my Christmas list. In addition, I suggested in my annual Christmas letter, &quot;If you haven't already read THE STRENGTH WITHIN, please put it on your 'to-do' list.&quot; I have been warmed by the responses of those who have read it or who have contacted me about where to purchase the book. It was such a pleasure for me to read, digest, enjoy the value of Dr. Hansen's never-ending poignant messages, and especially, to now recommend this very significant book."},{"Title":"The Books of Philippians and Colossians: Joy and Completeness in Christ (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"Gromacki's book on Philippians and Colossians is a very well written commentary dedicated to accurate translation, word studies, and a solid interpretation. He provides a comprehensive and thought provoking look at both books of the Bible.Essentially, he divides the book itself into two broad sections covering Philippians and Colossians respectively. From there, he breaks down segments of Scripture into chapters drawing out the interpretation, meanings of key words and phrases, and adequately applies it to the contemporary believer's life. Both sections are similar in length, being 111 pages and 100 pages respectively. He includes study questions at the end of each chapter allowing for further reflection and application both for the reader and the potential audience of the reader.Dr. Gromacki is careful to allow the text to interpret itself, not the other way around. His in depth knowledge of the Word of God shines through. For those who are looking for a literal interpretation of God's Word, a conservative and dispensational view, this commentary is the right one. For the pastor or layman who is a Sunday School teacher, this is a great resource for planning and preparing a sermon or lesson. This book provides careful instruction with practical application; it has everything a good commentary needs."},{"Title":"The Company Culture Cookbook: 70 easy-to-use recipes to create the right climate inside your business","review":"YES! At last, a management book that is very informative and fun to read! The colour pictures are a great idea, one on every other page, each one matches the &quot;recipe&quot; or idea. They add a fresh and memorable way to remember the topics. The &quot;menus&quot; and &quot;Chefs notes&quot; make it quick and easy to understand, especially with my hectic lifestyle! Although seemingly aimed at &quot;executives&quot; and Human Resouces, the book is valuable to everyone. &quot;Internal&quot; marketing makes a lot of sense and this helps how to approach it.I found that even though it reads in sequence, you can pick any chapter, read and understand it.The trick will be to get the books ideas across for all to get the &quot;buy in&quot; that is required to change the culture.Excuse the pun but the book gives a lot of food for thought!"},{"Title":"The Company Culture Cookbook: 70 easy-to-use recipes to create the right climate inside your business","review":"The Company Culture Cookbook is one of those books that you should keep handy and refer to whenever you feel lost: if there is no recipe for your exact problem, I'm sure you will at least find inspiration and strength to deal with it."},{"Title":"Poles Apart: Parallel Visions of the Arctic and Antarctic","review":"This is much more than a coffee table book, though its unique photographs of the pristine beauty of the Arctic and Antarctic would impress even the most casual of browsers. A short story about each photo is included, along with more general, thoughtful and poignant commentary from someone that is truly in touch with the global environment. Rowell is one of the great nature photographers, and this is a stunning collection"},{"Title":"Poles Apart: Parallel Visions of the Arctic and Antarctic","review":"Turning to page 74, my Danish-born wife, Aino, was amazed to discover her little town of Scoresbysund. She spent her fomative years(age 5-12)growing up there, where her father, Dr. Werner Mortensen, served as the sole doctor for the area of 3 villages.Galen Rowell's photography captures the typical beauty of a Scandinavian mileau, even though it is truly a facade for the garbage that the typical native Greenlander casts no further than his front door!His words portray the many problems of the native Inuits, who have been unable to adapt to the influence of Danish culture and progress. For Rowell to elaborate on the problems of alcholism, violent crime, and the high rate of suicide in a village of only 500, distinguishes him as an author that researchs his subjects quite well! It brought back memories for my wife of the &quot;Grundlander&quot; that beat his wife with the carcass of a frozen seal, only to have his wife bite of his ear.The large yellow building in the left foreground is the eight bed hospital; the little red house with white trimmed windows that is over to the immediate left is where family Mortensen grew up from 1966-72. This book really takes my wife back,and helps me see things that were only in her mind's eye. It also brings her up to the what the present day Scoresbysund has become. And now that my family will be moving to Fairbanks,Alaska, my wife can get a sneak preview of our future from this marvelous book. Having lived in Alaska myself, I definitely recommend this book for its shear splendid photography and candid commentary. Great job Galen!"},{"Title":"Poles Apart: Parallel Visions of the Arctic and Antarctic","review":"Wow, what a great and such awesome picture volume. This book not only shows you pictures from the Arctic and the Antarctic, it particularly reveals the true differences between the two polar regions...they ARE truly different and fascinating! This book also delivers very-high quality photography, which can easily tempt you into travelling to such exotic destinations.In the book, you will find 2 pictures side by side-one showing the Arctic, the other showing Antarctic. That way, you will get an idea of its differences. In addition, there is a separate chapter that dedicates to interesting stories regarding these regions, anything from life in Siberia, Inuit life in northern Alaska, to the South Georgia Islands &amp; the South Pole. Last, but not least, there is also a whole section reviewing all the pictures showed in the book, including background information describing each photo, etc.This is truly an amazing picture volume that is a MUST-HAVE for any polar fanatic. Get prepared for over 180 pages of some superb photography and much info on these fantastic regions. For the money, it was quite worth it..."},{"Title":"Poles Apart: Parallel Visions of the Arctic and Antarctic","review":"If you are a fan of Galen's work you will certainly enjoy this book. The concept, comparing and contrasting the two poles, is brilliant.The photographs are typical Galen - beautiful, engaging, illuminating. The accompanying text provides context and insight.There is an essay section at the back that provides some insight into how Galen thought about the photos that appear in this book. Very interesting reading and a great teaching aid for amateur photographers and photojournalists."},{"Title":"The Ruby","review":"How can one begin to describe this awesome book?First of all - the story is about Barret Winslow who flees through the gaslit London streets, stalked by a ruthless enemy in search of a secret she can never reveal. And when fate tosses her into the arms of an exotic stranger, she finds herself swept away to a brazen steamy paradise that hides deadly secrets and forbidden passions.To London's rich and powerful he is Deveril Pagan, Viscount St.Cyr, envied by all men and desired by all women. But in the mist-covered emerald hills of Ceylon, he is called the Tiger Sahib, and for him the priceless, fabled ruby is only a curse, its bloodred facets pulsing with savage powers that drive men to unquenchable greed and women to unspeakable desire.From the glittering corridors of London's elite to the windswept shores of colonial Ceylon, they tried to flee their fierce fate, which throbbed in the crimson heart of the legendary jewel...driving the lovers to stolen passion and unthinkable evil in the sultry, tropical night. For there, only one man stands between Barrett and the darkness... and he might just be the greatest threat of all.... (text refers to book's back cover)There that should do it to make you understand the story. I really hate it when there are reviews who just limit themselves in saying that the book was good or bad without ever mentioning anything about the story.One last thing I'd like to add is that, with this book, Christina Skye has again given me more reason to rate her as one of the best (if not the best)of romance authors today.The Ruby is full of action and excitment. From London to Ceylon, it takes us to a journey we can never forget. The two main characters - Barret and Deveril - have to face several tumultous clashes before they admit or even realize their love towards each other. I read this book in just one day, it was so engrossing i didn't want it to end.The Ruby is totally in Ms Skye's style. She is one of the few authors who can write such an exciting romance between two such passionate characters and include all the possible ingredients to make a novel something of a classic. The love scnes are sizzling. The action is never ending. I would like to find more books that are written in this style.Another book i would highly recommend that is as beautiful as The Ruby is 'the Black Rose',also by Christina Skye of course. Well I have already said enough. Just go and buy it, you wont be disapointed!"},{"Title":"The Ruby","review":"From the very first pages of this 500 page book the author will capture your attention starting with the prologue of a madman type \`Jack the Ripper' finishing up one of his dastardly deeds. So you know that there is going to be some mayhem and mystery here, along with the quest for the Shiva Ruby, at once beautiful and deadly for all that try to possess it.From the prologue you will first meet our heroine Barrett Winslow who is running in fear for her life along the London streets, guarding the secrets that will protect her grandfather. Along this same street that she will be pulled into the embrace of a mysterious dark skinned, foreign man in a turban, an embrace that will haunt the man and woman and change their lives forever. It is in that fateful contact that begins this story of greed, madness, treachery and a love so sensually described that will make your spine shiver and your toes curl! Although Barrett, is tempted to run away with him that very night, after the amazingly HOT kiss they shared, she refuses Pagan's offer and continues to run trying to elude the men who are after her. Too bad she didn't follow her first instinct, as she would have eliminated the next three months of torture and degradation that followed her imminent capture.Through the evil machinations of a madman, Barrett is found three months later by Deveril Pagan washed up on his beach in Ceylon. He doesn't quite recognize her as the dye she had been using to disguise herself in London had washed out. On top of that, the beard and disguise he sported in London were gone. Then again, Barrett had suppressed all the horrors and pain of the last three months and has lost her memory. Somehow, Pagan \`felt' he knew this woman from London, but also knew that she could never have ended up on his deserted beach without the help of his worst enemy. He fought his attraction, constantly reminding himself of the dangers but never quite conquering the all consuming desire he felt for this, his Angrezi.This is an amazingly sensual trip that two extremely stubborn and haunted individuals took. Both fight the unknown nightmares each had, trusting no one, nor their feelings. Through the discoveries made on their trek to Pagan's tea plantation in the jungles of Ceylon, amid the dangers both human and of nature, they come to trust one another, but more than that to let their love heal and soothe their nightmares away.Excellent writing, fast paced, exciting adventure, and very hot love scenes! Another winner for Ms. Skye!"},{"Title":"The Ruby","review":"Wow! Once again Christina Skye does not disapoint. In fact she delightes me once again with this magnificent book.

But, to my surprise and delight i have found that The Ruby is as beautiful as the Black Rose was.Here is the story:Teal-eyed enchantress Barrett Winslow flees through the gaslit London streets, stalked by a ruthless enemy in search of a secret she can never reveal.

A MUST! I LOVED IT!"},{"Title":"The Ruby","review":"Despite some 20th century vernacular lapses (see chapter 15 &quot;Read my lips&quot;), this was an engrossing and fast moving book, entertaining from beginning to end.

I read th e reviews of it and bought it as a result. I have found it to be one of the less valuable SL books with mediocre photography, a fair amount of mis-information and lacking some real writing on the experience of owning these cars. Each has a terrific history and there really isn't that much on their development history. I write for an automotive magazine and hate inaccuracies in facts about automobiles such as saying that the R107 cars had a leather dash. They never did. In addition, many of the cars used as picture cars are equipped with aftermarket wheels and accessories. That also does not to me make it a true color History. If it were the cars would be as they came from the factory. There are enough of these cars out there to find picture cars that are in stock condition.On a plus side there are some nice driving impressions that point out how the different series roadsters compare to each other.While it is not the weakest Mercedes SL book, my advice is if you really want it find a inexpensive used copy. If you want a super Mercedes SL book buy a copy ofMercedes SL Series: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)It is possibly the best book on these cars out there."},{"Title":"Moving From Fear to Courage: Transcendent Moments of Change in the Lives of Women","review":"This book defines the quote: &quot;Courage is not having the strength to go on; It's going on when you don't have the strength&quot;.The authors have taken the true stories of many women and given them to us in a way that allowed me to see and feel them."},{"Title":"Moving From Fear to Courage: Transcendent Moments of Change in the Lives of Women","review":"Moving from Fear to Courage: Transcendent Moments of Change in the Lives of Women by Heather Waite and Cheryl Fischer helps readers to understand the connection between these powerful emotions.I found the anecdotal stories from the women interviewed for the book to be insightful and moving.

This format allowed me to make a better connection with the topic of fear. By reading what others have experienced and consequently perservered allowed me to gain a better picture of how I personally respond to the very same challenges that we all face.By identifying the connection between fear and courage one can be encouraged and empowered to move past the obstacles, real or imagined.

Buy this book together with Volume I. I especially liked the chapter on inflection points. I was having the problem of making it to the final table with a moderate to short stack.

Harrington, though not as hyped as several players on TV, has been at the final table of the main NLHE WSOP tournament three times, capturing the gold bracelet in 1995.According to one estimate, Harrington's winnings are almost $3.5 million. The man knows poker.In hand-by-hand questions and answers, Harrington analyzes the late game and final table struggles. He begins with moves you need to get ahead late in a tournment. (Just to underline that you should have read the first volume, the opening chapter here is chapter 8.)Then he covers his main theme, inflection points: the clash between the blinds and antes and you stack of chips, when extreme measures -- like going allin -- are necessary. To a non-pro player, the hands he will move allin are surprisingly weak: even QT offsuit. What? (I guess that's why I'm not a pro.) Next he discusses multiple inflection points, short handed play, and finally headsup play.Many of his ideas are surprising to me. For example, the better your starting hand is, the less you bet. You want someone to call your better hands.This is an important tourney book by a WSOP winner. You need this book in your poker library. You really should buy it, but go ahead and talk your friends out of getting it.

Volume II covers the endgame-- short tables, short stacks, getting blinded out, that sort of thing. If the book does have a weakness, it's that most of Harrington's scads of examples put the player on a medium or high stack; one would expect a book aimed at teaching players to reflect more of where they're likely to be, which is at the bottom of the barrel.

Working through the ideas in this book carefully seems assured to substantially improve anyone's game. Even another professional gains the advantage of getting a fairly deep look at the thinking of one of the great players of the last two decades.

His books are packed with very good examples and he describes the logic of his actions very well.Volume II could've been as great as vol I. However this first printing (June 2005) contains a lot of printing errors and other logical errors and unfortunately Two plus two publishing provides no error correction for their books on their homepage. Most of the time you can figure out what he means or what's wrong with the example but not all the time.For instance, example hands 11-18 and 11-19 makes no sense when you read them together. Both examples describe a similar situation where you're up against a conservative player. However when Harrington later explains why he acted differently in the latter situation he then says it's because the opponent in 11-18 was an aggressive player (that plays more hands)...Thoroughout example 11-18 the opponent was described as a conservative player (just as in 11-19) so the conclusion is a true contradiction and the reader is left with no help on how to act in situations like these."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"Buy this as one of a set of two (buy Vol I)Read em, then read em again...the get them blessed at your church find a nice leather jacket for them and put them beside your bed...just like you would your bible.

This book does not have that problem, and it doesn't even have a huge math focus in it. It has math, but you can understand it. This book does an amazing job at how you need to approach the later stages of a no limit Holdem tournament. This is also one of the few books (or maybe the only) that apply a mathematical approach to the Super-aggressive style of poker that works so well in no limit. The best thing about this book is that it makes it very easy to understand and comprehend the lessons of the book, but so many people ignore the lessons. Harrington covers how often you should bluff, when the blind/stack ratio affects you and how to adjust, and head's up play.

Top book, 5 stars"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"Harrington and Robertie have surely done it again -- even more powerfully than in their first volume. They have presented the authoritative text about how to think about and how to play a final table in a no limit hold em tournament. And in so doing they have redefined the game.Harrington and Robertie introduce a whole new lexicon (at least it was new to me) about no limit poker: inflection points, red zones, dead zones, green zones, probe bets, continuation bets. Some of these phrases I had heard -- maybe even dropped to impress people from time to time. But they explain them clearly and tie them all together in a vivid strategic picture of the game.But even if you were familiar with all of these terms and phrases that help clarify the many otherwise intuitive concepts of no limit tournament play, you've never read a simpler, clearer or more powerful explanation of them -- and all of the different stages players enter as their stack size grows and diminishes at the final table in a tournament. Similarly so with other vital concepts to no limit play like continuation and probe bets and final table play. Harrington and Robertie take the ideas that excellent players have intuitively known but until now have not fully expressed and put them into clear, simple language that any moderately experienced player can readily grasp and absorb. The hand examples, which the authors think us through further drive home the key points of this masterwork.To say that this is a must read for every serious hold em player doesn't do it justice. It is a book that has set a new standard for poker literature. Even if you are a very experienced winning no limit tournament player, this book will help you think and play. And I don't think that it is overstating it to say that it will significantly change the way players talk and write about the game in the future.Bravo Harrington and Robertie. Your two volumes are by far the best I have ever read -- and I've read just about everything that's out there."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"This book and its companion Volume II are like my bibles. I have only being playing online poker tournaments and sit-and-go gamesfor three months and am already consistently winning money and getting to the final table in tournaments of 150 players or so, and have won a couple too.When I started I bought a number of books that were well reviewed on Amazon, but frankly the rest of them are not worth a hill of beans, whereas this one is worth its weight in gold. I will not go into a description of the contents, because so many reviews have already done so, but if you want to master tournament poker, or you want a great gift for your family poker player, then look no further.I should also say that the book is extemely well written, which is not always the case with poker books. The authorial voice is sometimes witty, and always a great friend and companion.This book is the definitive work on the subject of no limit hold'em tournament play. I just hope my opponents don't read it."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"There is an old adage that says sequels are never as good as the original. For the most part this saying holds true but then there is the exception. Back in 1974 a sequel came out that broke the mold of how a second movie was expected to turn out. There will be endless discussions regarding which of the 2 films was superior, but there was no denying that when the second film was made, it not only was a success, but one of the greatest movies ever made.That film was The Godfather, Part IIWith 'Harrington on Hold'em Volume II: Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments: Endgame', Action Dan has managed to make the impossible possible. He (along with Bill Roberte) have written a sequel so good that it is hard to distinguish the two books and easily point to a reason why the first book is better than the sequel.With the focus being how to play the middle to end stages of a tournament, Harrington has written a book that even the most experienced of players will be able to profit from. My favorite 2 points made in this book are as follows:1. The concept of M and why it is so important to always know where your stack is in relation to the antes and blinds.2. When heads up, nearly any 2 cards are worth playing and you are never that far behind.I really hope that Dan Harrington doesn't sell a lot of these books, because anyone that reads, learns, and follows the advice within is going to become a much better poker player. Employing a writing style that makes even the most difficult concepts easy to understand and follow, the end result is incredible.I said it when I reviewed the first book, these are the most important poker books written since Doyle Brunson's Super/System which came out in the 1970s, and it is REQUIRED reading for ALL Hold 'Em players.Wonderful, wonderful poker book by one of the best players in the world.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"Everyone else has pretty much summed this book up, for players with a solid game that want to take that next step, these books are the bibles of poker, specifically tournament poker.As was already mentioned, Harrington has a reputation of being a tight, conservative player but his advice on playing when short stacked is far from conservative. He explains why it is so necessary to avoid being blinded down to the point where at least the big blind has pot odds to call with virtually any two cards.The chapter on calculating the ratio of your chip stack to the size of the pot at the start of the hand (defined as your \\"M\\") is the single most important chapter of a poker book I have ever read. He explains why hands that are playable with a big stack are unplayable with a small one, and just as importantly how hands that are playable with a small stack are not with a bigger stack!I consider myself a pretty good hold 'em player, but as another reviewer also said, I would so often make the money but without many chips to advance to where the real money is. Since reading this three book trilogy and Volume II in particular, my play late in tourneys when the bubble is approaching has improved immensely. The way Harrington explains things just makes so much sense. My natural style is to play fairly tight so Harrington's style is one I try to emulate. I was stunned reading the sections on short stack play, to see how many \\"weak\\" hands he recommended playing, but the way he explains why just makes sense.And unlike so many pros that have authored books (particularly Phil Hellmuth), there is little mention of reading opponents based on physical tells, but more along the lines of being able to determine an opponent's holding based on what style they play. The truly great pros rely a lot on reading their opponents based on mannerisms along with betting patterns, but for the rest of us, smart analytical play is the best way for us to be successful.In addition, the book has several problem hands taken from online play rather than from live tournaments. In far too many poker instruction books, the author assumes that your opponents are always excellent players. Online however, there are many players that are average or worse and Harrington shows how those players can be exploited.He also explains the big difference in strategy as the bubble is near in tournaments and sit-and-go one table online games, one of the few poker books I have ever seen to do this.If you are a primarily a tournament player, whether online, live or both, you simply must read these books. Volume I is more of a book that covers the basics, Volume II is really simply the rest of Volume I and covers end game play and includes an extensive section on heads-up play.I have paid for these books many, many times over, I cannot recommend these books too highly!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I've been playing poker for about three years now casually but for the last year I've put in more hours into improving my game. I currently consider myself a decent tournament player with 50% of my tournament results ending in the money and the other 50% on the bubble.The problem was, once I made the money, I rarely had chips to play and usually get blinded out. This is where Harrington on Hold'em comes into effect. As soon as I bought Volume 1 I finished it in less than 24 hours. It is that good. Volume 1 gives you a good core on how to approach tournaments and teaches you how to play with discipline. For me, I already knew most of the concepts but reading the book help clean up my game and patch loose ends.Volume 2 is where it gets exciting. I've recently started Volume 2 and am already impressed. Volume 2 discusses the end game of tournaments which includes making moves, bluffs, and playing short handed; all of which I needed a lot of help on. While Volume 1 is good I think Volume 2 is what separates the men from the boys. Being able to pull off well timed bluffs is a valuable skill in hold'em because it is always more rewarding to win a huge put with a bluff than a monster hand.I'd like to think of the set in this sense. Volume 1 is like the good girl you want to marry and bring home to mom. She'll wash your clothes, cook you meals, do the dishes, but over time you'll get tired of her because she is just too predictable and boring.Volume 2 is that sexy bad girl you constantly fantasize about. She is seductive, exciting, and a pure freak. As much as you enjoy the hot steamy romps, there really is no future for the both of you because she is too unstable. Adding both of these books to your arsenal is like finding the perfect woman.I hear Volume 3 is coming out in May and I can't wait. If you really want to improve your tournament game, you have to get the entire set."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"The real surprise about this book is not how good it is. The true wonder is that it or something like it has not already been written!Super/System by Doyle Brunson is considered by many to be the poker player's \\"Bible.\\" While Super/System is an excellent cash game book, and a great introduction a wide variety of poker games, it has little to say about tournament play. If you've played in both tournaments and cash games, you know that the strategic difference between the two is enormous!The poker \\"boom\\" has caused greater involvement in all forms of poker, yes, but the game on everyone's mind is the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em Tournament. It's what you see the pros playing on TV, and it's where the largest prize pools can be won. I've been wondering since Moneymaker's victory at the 2003 World Series--WHY hasn't a definitive straegy volume on tournament No-Limit Texas Hold 'em been published?There were a few places to turn before Harrington on Hold 'em. David Sklansky's Tournament Poker for Advanced Players is not bad, although it's my belief that it contains a good ammount of misinformation (besides, what tournaments have you seen Sklansky win? Have you ever seen him at a final table, even?) I believe that Cloutier and McEvoy have a few tournament books as well, but I haven't heard good things about them.Harrington on Hold 'em is, at long last, a book which reveals everything one might ever need to know to play tournament No-Limit Texas Hold 'em. Harrington meticulously describes not only bluffing and slow-playing, but every different type of bluffing and slow-playing, when to use them and when not to. Harrington claims that his section on inflection points is the most important, and he's right. Inflection points are the absoulte essence of no-limit, and if you aren't aware of them on a least a subconcious level, you will fail at tournament poker.Even if you think you are a great player, I still cannot stress how much you should read this book. You have no idea how much better you can get! At the very least, reading this book will validate plays you have already been making, justifying them as \\"correct\\" in a professional's knowing mind and giving you the confidence to use them again in the future.In short, if you play tournament No-Limit Texas Hold 'em, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I had been anxiously awaiting this book since reading Harrington's \\"Volume One Strategic Play.\\" Well, I wasn't disapointed. There are many things revealed that have never been revealed before in poker books. The section on heads up is especially educational and eye-opening. This book is not for beginners and you should definitely read volume one before cracking this one. Both books are well worth the investment believe me. They are by far the best!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I find myself continually re-reading Volume 1 of \\"Harrington on Hold 'em,\\" so was ecstatic when Volume 2 was released. The most important benefit of Harrington's books is the depth with which he analyzes situational play. If you've ever found yourself feeling lost and pushed around in the latter stages of a NL Hold 'em tournament, this book is essential. This book really helped me understand just how dynamic the tournament environment is and how necessary it is to adapt your style of play. His Zone System is a brilliant way of tracking just what kind of shape you're in as the blinds continue to increase and the tables shorten. Implementing his Red Zone strategy has salvaged several tournaments for me. His chapter on heads-up play will give you a fighting chance to win it all if you've played successfully enough to get that point. Overall, Harrington's books just bring an amazing amount of clarity to a complex game. If you buy Harrington's books, don't just read them once. They bear re-reading many, many times because of the situational concepts they illustrate. These are truly masterful works that teach you how to think deeply about the game, not just play it mechanically. I can't wait for Volume 3, which is supposed to be a large collection of situations and problems in sort of a quiz format."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"WOW! I have read many books of poker but nothing like this, this book is far the best book ever written even the best sellers like Doyle Brunson's Super System or Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players do not have the information that this book has.

Bottom Line: If you want to step up your NL Hold'em tourament game, these books will do it for you. You can only get so lucky in touraments, in the long run you need SKILL to be a winner and consitant in NLHE Touraments. The knowelege from these books combined with table experiance is in my opinion the making of a great overall NLHE Tourament player.PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE...This book teaches you the skills necessary to be sussesfull. You must understand: Proper Out Calculation, pot odds, implied odds, position, continuation bets, betting patterns, M, Q, Squeeze Plays, Gap theory, Value Bets, ect... ect....These books cover just about all you need to be a sucessfull NL Tourament player. To understand and apply the knowlege in these books, and learning to think for yourself will make you lethal at the poker tables. You can read these books over and over again to absorb more knowlege and you will not get bored.These books are Very well written and it's easy to understand the concepts. If you dont understand them Harrington gives you examples and senerios. I will personlly thank Dan Harrington for being so honest and for not holding anything back in these books. He has definatly taken a risk writing these books.He writes about what no other NLHE books to date include. These books have helped me tremendously!!

The second one has much less material and more example hands. I actually went back and read part 2 twice and skipped the examples the second time. It took about an hour (just not that much there). I do like the fact that he does not focus only on the big hands but covers in depth more average hands.There is an overall theme to this book which is about watching your stack size relative to the blinds and how this should affect your play. It does seem extream to me but I will give it a try and see if it works. My issues with this book are not meant as judgement of the strategy but more just disappointment with the quantity of material. Seemed to me the first book covered much more ground.That said, Harrington's books are at the top of my list so far. He avoids silly stuff and is very rational.

The fact that he has a math background serves well for a player like myself.My poker play has improved tremendously because of this book. I used to play 2/4 limit poker but have now progressed to Sit and Gos and Tournaments. Of the last 9 Sit and Gos i have played in a card room, I have won three (shared first twice), came in 2nd or 3rd on the other three and lost three times (although i was usually 4th or 5th when such happened).

But it wasn't until reading these books that I realized I had some control over my game. Harrington combines theory with practicality. He puts you at numerous tables, the make-up of each one different than the others, and challenges you to decide how much you'd bet and why you would bet in each situation. Then he gives his opinion. As in a real game, not all hands are won, not all hands are played as he would play them, and he factors in the element of luck. This is a book for serious players."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I have read a lot of books on Hold'em, some useful and some worthless. However, the Harrington on Hold'em Series is far and away the best instruction out there. The Harrington Vol. 2 (Harrington Red) takes you into the strategy and tactics of the latter stages of a no-limit tournament, where he guides you into making it into the money, the final table, short table, and ultimately Heads Up for the championship. You will learn key tripwires on when you MUST make a move while on the bubble, as your stack gets small and the Blinds get big.Harrington and Robertie's books not only provides outstanding instruction, but also provide a refreshing read with amusing anecdotes, excellent hand summaries, and great sports and pop culture references (the parable of the \\"Dark Tunnel Bet\\" and the stupid teenagers that say, \\"lets go into this dark scary looking house and look around,\\" was particularly hilarious.I find the Harrington Trilogy valuable is because I have won money with it.

Clearly his tight aggressive style, documented in this (and the prequel) book is a good reason why.After watching Harrington in a couple of WSOP events, where you can see his hole cards and follow his action, it is interesting to see that he doesn't always follow his own advice. But it is clear that he uses his super tight image to make the occasional targeted bluff. In any case, both of these are excellent books on no limit holdem in general, and tournament poker in specific.Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"This book is incredible.

I am not a very advanced player, so I can't reallys say if this book is advanced or intermediate, but it seems pretty advanced to me. Bottom line is that you will get intermediate to advanced strategy from this book (and vol 1 which should be read first obviously). It goes beyond the basics of pot odds and reading the flop and counting odds, though these concepts are used in the strategies he talks about. This book is more about tournament management than straightforward strategy which is covered in vol 1.I haven't found any better books on tournament hold em than vol 1 and 2 of Harrington, I haven't completed Super System 2, but so far I believe that these books are better."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"Dan Harrington's volume 1 and 2 are great for beginners needing a clue.

Every book that comes after may agree, disagree, or clarify what a definitive book has to say on its subject, but there is one thing subsequent books can't do: they can't ignore it. If you're a serious tournament poker player, you can't ignore the Harrington series. This is THE classic text on Texas hold em poker tournament strategy, bar none.Vol. 2 continues the greatness of Harrington's series by moving away from the formulaic, conservative approach taken in Vol. 1. This is understandable, since you have to learn to walk before you can run. And by the time you finish Harrington Vol. 2, you'll be ready for the speed trials! Words like \\"highly recommended\\" can be overused, so I'll just say you'd be crazy to gamble any serious amount of money without buying and completely absorbing all three of Harrington's books. You should also re-read them right before any major event to clarify your thinking. They're THAT good!I'd also recommendThe Poker Tournament FormulaandPoker Tips that Pay: Expert Strategy Guide for Winning No Limit Texas Hold emfor readers that are looking beyond the Harrington series, for additional hand-based poker strategies and techniques.

Harrington and Robertie are a tour de force, dismantling the concepts that many of the best players bring to their games as winning players and articulate them in ways that less experienced (although you will need some level of understanding of the game) players can understand and quickly implement the ideas and advice.As with the first book, the hand examples are one of the strongest parts of this book, helping you see how the ideas and concepts are actualized in hand play, and real hand play, not a simplified mock-up that feels like you'll never encounter in a real game.Personally, this helped address one of the biggest issues I have in my poker game, which is adapting my game as the conditions change, specifically late in tournaments when blind size starts becoming a bigger and bigger deal and necessitates a change in playing style. In this book, Harrington and Robertie make the case for adapting styles with conditions in such a clear and usable way that I felt like I was immediately ready to sign up for a tournament the next day.I think someone else wrote here that they hope this doesn't sell too many copies. This is the only downside I can see from this book, since I fear it's too easy to substantially improve your tournament play with this book, and therefore affect my tournament winnings.

If you find yourself getting to the final table a lot but not cashing, this one is an absolute must!!My one criticism is that there are relatively few absolutes - but then, that's poker, isn't it? Clearly AX offsuit is a raising hand heads-up, and probably three-handed. How small does the table have to be for it to be playable at all? He doesn't really say - but maybe there are no absolute correct answers!!I am now learning the process of figuring out the opponent's hand based on his bets etc., and the examples in this book do a ton of that.

It introduces many concepts that have never been touched by other books such as the zones, inflection points, and heads up play. The heads up section is an absolute masterpiece. That was the one part of my game that I dreaded, I was lost when it came to heads up, but Dan gave a list of what hands to raise with and how much to raise. He made clear what hands were good after the flop and how to play them accordingly. What was really cool about that section was that he took several hands Phil Ivey and John D'agostino played heads up and analyzed each play. Heads up is now the stongest part of my game. After reading the book you will gain a good feel about how to adjust as the blinds go up and tables shrink. But its very important to have read volume I first. The book is easy to read and understand, but you should have a pretty good sense of tournament play before reading it. Great work Dan!!!!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I've now read both Harrington's Volumes I & II on Texas Hold em - terrific books. This volume (II - Endgame) is an essential follow up to Volume I. I've read Brunson's Super System. He's got some good insights, but alot of rambling too. Alot of these poker books are about the authors philosophy of poker and the great accomplishments they had - who cares? Just tell me how to make good bets! And that's just what Harrington does. Harrington's book really gives you the nuts and bolts of good poker. When I was at my first tournament, I remember most of the time not really knowing what decisions to make, whether it was pre-flop, post-flop etc. I was always going by my \\"instincts\\". Well guess what? My instincts suck - as do most people's. Yeah, you may get a good read once in a while, but that's it. I finally feel like I can make good decisions. I never had any idea the game was so complicated, but I have a much better appreciation for it now. One of the best things it taught me, and that I wasn't doing, was to try and figure out what the other players had based on their betting and their styles. If you do read this book, I hope I never have to play against you!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"Harrington on Hold'em Volumes I and II are the only books I have ever read which have taught me how to earn money. This may be the first poker book ever published in which the author actually appeared to be more interested in teaching people how to play poker than in making money from book sales and gratifying his ego. It is evident throughout the book that Mr. Harrington is a classy human being who loves professional poker, and wants to give something back to the game.Harrington on Hold'em, Volumes I and II are the best books ever written on No Limit Texas Hold'em tournament play. If you want to learn how excellent players approach situations in all phases of NL tournament play, read and study Dan Harrington's books. Both volumes are suitable for intermediate and advanced Hold'em players. Beginners should first learn the basics of Hold'em before tackling Mr. Harrington's books. He writes clearly and succinctly, and remarkably, even the most advanced concepts are fairly easy to understand. Both volumes are coherent and well organized. They cover most important aspects of NL tournament play and include in depth analysis appropriate for playing on-line tournaments, one table satellites, SNG's, and large multi-table tournaments.Both text and the examples of sample hands at the end of each chapter are comprehensive, and very well written. Remarkably, Dan Harrington is an outstanding teacher, as well as a great poker player.Volume I covers the beginning and middle stages of No Limit, tournament play. Important concepts such as pot odds, implied odds, folding equity, betting sequences, and table image are clearly explained, and a large number of sample hand examples and analysis are included which clarify all of the concepts covered. Much of the text covers strategy which should be employed against good to excellent players, but Mr. Harrington offers some guidance on how players should adjust their play against average and weak opponents. Although he discusses conservative, aggressive, and super-aggressive types of play, he primarily teaches his preferred style of play, tight-aggressive, which generally is the optimal style for most players.Volume II analyzes the latter stages of tournament play, the final table, short-handed situations, and heads-up play. Harrington's concept of zones and \\"M\\" (a measure of a player's chip stack relative to the blinds and antes) is an innovative tool that facilitates good decision making in the middle and late stages of tournaments.Without being didactic or heavily psychoanalytic, Mr. Harrington teaches his readers that outstanding poker players have courage, and must frequently take calculated risks during tournament play to maximize their chances of winning. He clearly differentiates between aggressive moves with positive expectations, and foolish aggression. The most critical chapters cover inflection points (critical periods), when players must make dramatic plays in order to optimize their chances of advancing in a tournament. He clearly defines when positive expected value plays should be made, and situations when pot odds should be disregarded.Harrington on Hold'em, Volumes I and II may be the best poker books ever published."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgame","review":"I found this book to be of particular use because it focused on topics not often covered in the other popular Hold'Em volumes (e.g., how tournament strategy differs by stage of event; short handed play; heads up play; making moves). In addition, the book is a nice combination of higher-level strategy with tactical guidance (i.e., specific hand charts and odds). I feel that this book helped my game signficantly and gives me a measurable edge in 'final table' situations against players that have not learned the concepts that Harrington presents.I would recommend that you read Volume One before reading this book. Volume One is focused more on general play at full tables. It does a great job of laying out both strategy and tactics, and the hand histories are particularly useful and thought provoking.I am primarily a ring-game NL player, but have found no decent books on the game.

Harrington successfully details strategies and plays that are specific to NL hold'em and NL tourney's in specific. But, much of the information can be cross-applied to ring games as well. Whereas Vol 1 really presented the basics and overarching concepts, Vol. 2 takes to the specific needs of various players covering different styles and methods to use when in equitable situations. The only flaw is that we may have to wait years before Harrington or 2+2 publishing comes out with a great NL book specifically for ring/cash games, especially as the popularity of hold'em increases and more and more casinos are filled with players."},{"Title":"Shirley Maclaine: Out on a Limb, Dancing in the Light, It's All in the Playing","review":"If you are searching for more meaning to life, Shirley does some major leg-work for you in this book.She travels the world and references many credible sources and spiritual hotspots... the way she analyzes situations, and gives a thorough perspective of both sides of the coin is plenty to be satisfied for the beginning of &quot;your&quot; search.This book will grip you, and is a great first step to spiritual awakening!"},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil Gaiman has several recurring themes to which he revisits again and again like the swallows returning to Capostrano. Foremost among these is the persistence of memory, which is the theme of \\"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch.\\"The tale revolves around a Punch n' Judy show at a seaside carnival and how it acts as a trigger for a young boys memories of his family. As with much of Gaiman's work, there are tales within tales here, and the real story he tells is more implied than elucidated upon.Dave McKean's art underscores this theme beautifully, with the \\"real\\" characters in the story as cartoon caricatures while the puppets look like photographs, exactly the focus with which young children would concentrate their memories. Can we not all remember a favorite toy more easily than our parents faces when we were little?A marvelous and poignant tale well worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil Gaiman is my hero. I always have, and always will be intrigued by Punch &amp; Judy. Therefore, Gaiman's Mr. Punch is one of the greatest works I've ever read. Though it is unfair to say &quot;Gaiman's Mr. Punch&quot;, as it is equally Dave McKean's, for without him, I'm sure Mr. Punch would lose part of its eerie, strange, subtle power. Mr. Punch is an odd book. I read it in a single sitting, and afterwards, I was actually at a loss for words trying to describe what it is. This was a first; I can praise Neil Gaiman for hours on end, but I was stuck with Mr. Punch. I've seen it classified as Horror, Science Fiction, normal Fiction, and just as a Comic. But it is much more. It sent something through me - something that I am also at a loss of words about. This is a really great story, much like a dream (or nightmare, depending) it is surreal, yet uncommonly realistic; it is disturbing, but also soothing. It's more of an experience than a reading. McKean's artwork and Gaiman's words send you into something of a trance, where you enjoy yourself, get disturbed (actually, more troubled, as the young protangonist would say), and subtly reminded of your own childhood. A must read for any Gaiman or McKean fan, and also a must read for any Punch &amp; Judy enthusiast, or anyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Mr. Punch is a difficult piece to review. It may be Neil Gaiman's finest work, but it is certainly his darkest. It is hard to describe the plot of Mr. Punch without giving anything away; suffice to say it is not the kind of work you would expect in a comic, and not what you would simply be able to put down and go on with your life once you have finished.Dave McKean's always innovative artwork enhances the nightmarish quality of the piece, and Neil Gaiman's prose is captivating as always. Mr. Punch is at the very least worth a read, and will likely find itself on your bookshelf next to all the other books that quietly changed the way you look at things."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I was ready for anything, not having read any Gaiman/McKein work for a very long time now, and picking this up made me feel bad for waiting so long. I was (and still am) amazed at the talent and magistry that Gaiman is able to reflect in eyes of a child, and how the story unfolds wonderfully with the sometimes beautiful, sometimes twisted and dark artwork found within. The pictures alone could tell an an amazing story, and the novella itself is told in the eyes of a child, and you know exactly whose voice the narrative is taking, from Mr Punch, to the Grandfather, to the child. I am a devoted fan, and this has only increased my hopes and chances of picking up more of his work. What are you doing still reading this? Go pick up this book!"},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Mr. Punch is one of those rare graphic novels that transcends the &quot;fat comic book&quot; and truly explores the possibilities of the medium. The text and illustrations are bound together and support each other, yang and yin, dreams and nightmares, innocence and experience.

It is built, and it is built to last. another thing I realy liked here is that this edition came signed - I'm not certain if that is normal or not but this was bught overseas and, honestly, a number of factors could have played into it.As far as Mr. Punch's story goes, it isn't simply a tale of the character. If it were, it would stay in the dark little realm that has been constructed for the character and that would be that. When I first read this story I didn't identify with Punch and Judy and so it was hard for me to understand the character. I know this was my own ignorance and it the harm it did to my perception of the book.That goodness I had the idea of checking into Punch and Judy to understand all of this more, because the character is so much to so many people.The story is not one of Mr. Punch, however, but of a boy that happens to find himself incolved with the character somewhat differently. It happens because of the way his parents - and grandparents - see the doll, with the hideous things he does as something that perhaps pollutes the minds of children. There is a part in the bok that stands with me because of that, with Mr. Punch taking a little baby puppet and hurling it out a window (off-stage) and then seeing the baby bleeding from its mouth with little jets of red paint.It conveyed such horror and I could understand how the boy in the story found the need to run then.I could also understand a lot about the boy because, amidst the rich writing and the wonderful plot, there was an artistry that really made me think \\"childhhood.\\" And maybe childhood is less of a word that innocence is but, whatever the case, it took me back and made me see through a fresh set of eyes. This is something you have to be willing to do, that is true and then some, and this si something you have to be wiling to really delve into. Otherwise, you have a story that can be difficult to understand in places and that might not be interesting.And that is understandable BUt it is not a grand thing that the book can be.For people who like the author and buy for namesake, look at what you are getting. The book is a piece of nice work and I loved it a lot more than I thought I would. I had to read it a few times to feel this way, however, and perhaps you might need that as well. Look at the samples, check the book out, and then decide.I really think you'll agree with me after giving the book a try."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I do love Neil Gaiman's work, but Mr. Punch is not one of his better efforts, in my opinion.It was loosely put together, and failed to offer up the blurbed promises of &quot;A nightmarish world of violence and betrayal.&quot; Though the artwork is good, and Mr. Gaiman's prose is good, the book simply was unable to create even a low-level dread of the creepy Punch &amp; Judy puppets.It is simply a bland story of a young boy's memories of his Grandfather's failing arcade off the main attractions of a seaside business area.The boy is sent to stay with his Grandparent's while his mother is due to deliver his baby sister, and he meets and old puppeteer who is not very mysterious and witnesses his grandfather have an argument with a young lady he is involved in. No real violence or threatening situations, merely a vaguely distorted view of some old puppets.The prose is good, but rather pointless; the artwork is good and strangely done, but when put together to form the whole it came out rather unfulfilling and anticlimactic. A rather generic musing of a mundane summer.If you have everything else by Neil Gaiman, then go ahead and fill up your collection with Mr. Punch, but this is not a good place to start to introduce yourself to Gaiman, and not recommended unless you are a die hard fan.Pick up one of his novels first, or his Sandman series or Black Orchid which was beautifully done."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"A subtle, creepy tale about childhood ghosts that never quite leave you. Dave McKean's artwork is both lovely and horrible, a perfect match for Gaiman's horribly lovely story."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"This is another one of the older Neil Gaiman graphic novels I haven't ever read so I was eager to read it. It was an interesting story; McKean's artwork is dark and provoking.This novel basically tells about a boy growing up. The Punch and Judy show plays a significant part in parts of his life, and at times his life seems to imitate the play.This is a typical Neil Gaiman story; it is well told, a little eerie, and a bit creepy. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this is more the story of a boy growing up than anything else. The Punch and Judy play has influence throughout the boy's life. Dave McKean's artwork is fantastic like usual and serves to enforce the eerie creepiness that surrounds this story.It is a very dark book with some occasionally dark implications, best for young adult or older. I found it to be an interesting read and I enjoyed it, but it isn't something that I would sit down and read again. I did like the way the Punch and Judy play was woven through out the boy's life and echoed in events that surrounded him.Overall I am glad I picked this up and read it. It was an interesting, if somewhat disturbing read, there were parts I really liked and I enjoyed the artwork throughout. If you are a Gaiman fan and like dark, somewhat disturbing images that are a bit fanciful you may like this. It is kind of a coming of age story with Punch and Judy influences. Not Gaiman's strongest work, but interesting all the same."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I bought this for my husband who loves graphic novels. He seemed to really like this book and all the interesting art in it. While reading it he said \\"this is crazy\\" many times.

For the child in the story, his life parallels the Mr. Punch story. Children are beaten and fall from windows. Women are beaten by men and fall down and the world seems to be a dark scary place. I intended to use this book with my students but found some nudity and others unsuitable items in the book so I will enjoy it myself and share the story with adult friends. Very interesting and very dark. Neil Gaiman doesn't seem to have experienced people as being kind or nice but violent and dark. Maybe Americans are a bit more optimistic about childhood or we tend to look on the bright side more often."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"These 2 have put together a wonderful movie and several wonderful graphic novels.

The story is as innocent as a child and as guilty as a scary clown. I liked it very much."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I've read and praised Gaiman's works before. I've read his novels, graphic novels, and anthologies, and always enjoyed them. Mr. Punch, however, was a big disappointment.The artwork varies widely. While many of the characters are drawn in normal cartoon fashion, the narrator (a little boy) is drawn to resemble a fox around the nose, and the puppets are shown as bad photographs. The narrator and the puppets, which are the main characters, are extremely unattractive, and are depicted so badly that I was constantly distracted from the story. I don't mind unattractively depicted characters, if they help tell the story, but these characters constantly jolted me out of the story and back to real life. The font used for the main character's remembrances, which again made up most of the text, was nearly unreadable, and on top of the basic unattractiveness/illegibility of the font, it was white on a black background. I guess that the letterer didn't feel that that font was hard enough to read, it needed that extra bit of eyestrain to make the reader's head ache a little more. Artwork and lettering should enhance a graphic novel (or any novel), they should not detract from it. And in the case of Mr. Punch, the artwork and lettering detract so much that I had to put the book down several times.While the story was acceptable, it was no more than that. It's certainly not worth re-reading...and in fact, I rather wish I hadn't read it even once."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"When I was 5, I wanted to be a &quot;poubelleman&quot; (in french-poo means trash bin collector), then I wanted to be fighter pilot, like my neighboor.

His work in this book makes me stare like a drooling idiot, only not drooling. He picks up on the darkness and the light, the innocence and pain in Neil Gaiman's moving, disturbing, nightmarish story. These two, as usual, make a great team."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"This is the first book I read of Neil Gaimen. I'm not to sure what I expected as no reviews really,really broke it down to what it is about. I agree with another reviewer that said the lettering made it difficult at times. The art and pictures I thought were not what I am used to but it did add to the story's brooding creepiness.I guess I was waiting for the story of punch and judy to actually be the uncle's story:In Like the Grandfather threw the uncle out of the window when he was a baby and killed his mother and the cop and killed the judge in escaping judgement. It's now has become the family's dark secret that they all live with and the uncle expresses it through the punch & judy puppet show which would be and is errie, to me at least.(this is why I believed the uncle was aloud to move the show to the grandpas' store in the begging, because the grandpa owes him# And the boy witnessing his grandpa hitting the girl only confirmed that he is still at it being evil. I was waiting for all this to be confirmed at the end and the nightmare would be that life would go on as normal for the boy even though it would never be the same because of what he now knows. I thought I was on the right track especially with the adult to kids thinking comparisons#which I did enjoy#. But I was wrong. I also figured the devil in the play to represent the uncle who is a constant reminder to the grandpa of what he has done, a living conscience so to speak. I was never sure what the aligators meant, something bad though.The ending sent me in a different direction. I took it to mean that if we killed the devil, then everything is okay to do. Meaning that if you killed the belief in the devil then you've killed belief in God and the struggle of what is right and what is wrong. And God #which I do believe in as being represented by Christ# is the foremost leader in what is that standard and what is not that standard of right and wrong. I think I probably got that part of the punch book wrong as well,maybe. It doesn't bother me if I was right to, as it is interesting whatever side you are on of a debate about morals.Well....if anyone who is more familuar with Gaiman's work could explain this more to me I would greatly appreciate your input. As it is I will re it again to try and figure it out more and I will still Gaiman another try. Everybody loves his work and I would like to get a chance to see whether I truly agree or disagree with everybody.Also if you have reccomendations, I would also appreciate that.p.s. another alternative that I came to as to this book's meaning is that there is a real Mr. punch and Judy story that was performed in this manner which I have no clue to the history of that probably"},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Good graphic novel. For some reason when I bought it I thought it was going to be scary. The story is kinda intresting, it is told from a childs perspective. The boy speaks about the differences of adults and children. This reminded me of when I was a kid. And it made me aware of how \\"dumb\\" us adults are too think we are \\"all mature\\".It was a good read. I have nothing bad to say about it. I think 3 stars does it justice though."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil and Dave add up to be nothing but a right angle. There is nothing wrong with this story. It is full of depth and realism yet it captures the macabre memories one can only associate with childhood. When the memory of a relative can be more frightening than any boogieman. The artwork leaves you breathless. I could spend several minutes looking at a fraction of a page, and pondering the blend of photography with illustration and the ways it contributed to a child's fantasy world and that of his reality. This was the first Gaiman graphic novel I read, and I'm glad because even though the Sandman comics are genius they don't encapsulate Gaiman and Mckean's ability to create a complete work of art."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil Gaiman has always said this is his best comic, and I find that really hard to believe. I would think that much of the 'Sandman' series is far superior in terms of plot and characterisations.It is a shame that the script has let this work done, because the artwork is probably the best I have ever seen for a comic/graphic novel, and certainly more appealing than 'Sandman'. Divinely textured, with incredible breath and detail, McLean's (responsible for the Sandman covers) work is truly incredible. The puppet photography is an innovative idea, and the portraits of the boy are also fantastic. The photography of the grandfather's hands also resonates, and overall the work has a wonderfully finished appeal.However, the series is too short and underdeveloped, and the characterisations are weak. I had difficulty telling several of the characters apart, while it does have that beautiful dark mystical quality I would come to expect with Gaiman."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I am 18 years old and I don't read alot of books. But occasionally I buy books just for the pure joy of owning a piece of art. I found Mr Punch in a bookstore and it's unique artwork immediately hinted me to buy it. I've heard Gaiman from DC Vertigo's Sandman and Death series but now i'm motivated to get the entire collection of Gaiman/McKean novels. There's no way to discribe the imagery and moody metaphors of the memories of life and death. If and when I would own my own little bookstore by the sea side, I would fill it all with books of such influence."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil Gaiman delivers yet another knockout in the realm of the graphic novel with his wonderfully dark and hallucinatory 'Mr. Punch.' A tale of dark and gloomy childhood flashbacks, 'Mr. Punch,' is a great read for those looking for something oozing with chilly atmosphere. The mixed-media (enhanced photos and pencils) artwork by Dave McKean is astounding as well and visually evokes a feeling of helplessness confronting a child when stuck in a grim and depressing environment that amplifies all of his little fears. While this book is nowhere near the epic grandeur of Gaiman's, 'Sandman,' series - as a standalone, 'Mr. Punch,' is a visual and narrative treat not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"Neil Gaiman crafts a superb and remarkably arresting story out of a young boy's experiences with his shady family members set against the backdrop of a deceptively harmless Punch &amp; Judy show. Gaiman, as well as McKean's excellent visuals capture that elusive feeling of being small, wide-eyed in wonder amidst sinister laughter from half-closed doors and such."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how to start a review of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's Mr. Punch, something apt that would suit this very unique graphic novel. The truth is, there's probably no perfect way to describe it. No way I know anyway. One look at the inside pages and you get that right off, there are no words to adequately describe Mr. Punch.The back cover reads \\"In his grandfather's failing seaside arcade, a young boy encounters a mysterious Punch and Judy man with a dark past, and a woman who makes her living playing a mermaid. As their lives intertwine and their stories unfold, the boy is forced to confront family secrets, strange puppets and a nightmarish world of violence and betrayal, in a dark fable of childhood innocence and adult pain.\\"That's not exactly how it goes.The narrator opens the story with the words, \\"My grandfather Arthur once took me fishing. I was seven.\\" This is a story of our now-grown narrator's childhood and a dark, rainy summer he spent with his grandparents while his mother gave birth. He is eight during most of the story, but the summer before, when his grandfather Arthur took him fishing, was his first encounter with Mr. Punch. Down the beach from where he and his grandfather are failing to catch any fish, the boy stumbles upon what he believes to be a deserted puppet stand. Mr. Punch and Judy pop up. Judy gives Mr. Punch the baby, then disappears. Mr. Punch tosses the baby out the window and the little stick puppet baby falls to the sand \\"silent and bleeding.\\" The boy flees the stand and rejoins his grandfather Arthur.The next summer he has chicken pox and is shipped off to his paternal grandparents (Arthur was his mother's father, but he spends his eighth summer with his father's parents who are never named) so as not to infect his mother or the baby she's about to deliver.It seems our earlier lives are measured in summers. I know those are the times I remember most. I know what I learned in school, but specific details from those years become more and more hazy the older I get. But the summers, I remember those. And eventually we come to that summer where everything changes. It's not so much that our lives are altered come that fall, but we are definitely not the children we were three months earlier. Such was our narrator's eighth summer spent with his grandparents.His grandfather owns a rundown arcade which is placed, unfortunately, away from the shore (which would, we're led to believe, be the best place for it, along the shore). It's a pathetic place with a dark ghost train and a half-naked woman dressed as a mermaid who sings to the patrons, of which there are rarely any. The boy's grandfather knows he's losing money, but is reluctant to let go of the arcade, reasoning that the warehouse in which it's located is the perfect place for people to come when it rains. But even when it rains, which is often, no one comes.One day a man shows up asking to set up his Punch and Judy show inside the arcade. The man, Swatchell, knows the boy's grandfather from years before--not only knows him, but knows secrets about him. The grandfather allows it, and the Professor (Punch and Judy men call themselves Professors, it seems), asks the boy if he wants to be Swatchell's bottler, the man who collects coins from the audience during the show.Swatchell gives the boy a brief education in Mr. Punch lore, shows him the puppets, and waxes nostalgic on the days when Punch and Judy were a good attraction. \\"The greatest, oldest, wisest play there is: the comical tragedy, the tragical comedy of Mister Punch,\\" Swatchell says.The boy, meanwhile, has nightmares and sometimes wakes to find his grandfather gone from the house. He overhears conversations he probably shouldn't, and when he sees a man beat a woman in the stomach with a wooden plank--much like Punch does to Judy, we realize--, his grandfather says to him, \\"You didn't see anything.\\" He's not asking him, he's telling, and the boy understands this.As I said, this is a hard story to classify. I know the plot, I understand what Gaiman is saying, but even now I know there's no way I can definitely tell you THIS is what Mr. Punch is about, or THIS is what he means, because when it comes to Neil Gaiman, you pretty much have to read what he wrote and hope to God you're bright enough to divine his meaning.Sorry, that sounds like he's a bad writer. But it's actually the opposite that's the truth. Neil Gaiman is a fantastic writer, a writer so good, in fact, it sometimes takes a lot to keep up with him. Anyone who's had the pleasure of reading his Sandman stories knows that. He's got such an imagination, I have to wonder what must his childhood have been like. He says in the acknowledgments, \\"Thank you to my parents and aunts and uncles, whose memories, both of Punch and Judy, and of my family history, I have so recklessly and shamelessly plundered and twisted to my own purposes,\\" and if Mr. Punch is any indication of the world he grew up in, I can begin to see now where he's coming from, and it's not a place I need to spend too much time in. And if imagination weren't enough, his writing itself, his prose, is yet another star of the book. He's got a way of making you shudder.\\"My grandfather picked me up. 'Shall I throw you in, eh? Shall I throw you in the water?' I shook my head. Adults are threatening. Shall I throw you in the water? I'll put you into the rubbish-bin. I'll eat you all up. I'll take you back and get another little boy. That's what they say. And no matter how much you tell yourself that they're lying, or teasing, there's always a chance. Maybe they are telling the truth. I had an aunt who claimed she had a tail, beneath her dress. I sneered at her, made sure she knew I knew she was lying; but secretly, I could not stop myself from wondering. Adults lie, but not always.\\"Another star of this book, one of the brilliant shining stars, is the artwork of Dave McKean, which is less pencil and ink and more computers and photography. Mr. Punch could have been a book of silence, just Dave McKean's pictures from one page to the next, and it would still be worth the $14.95 cover price. Dave McKean did the Sandman covers and those are probably where he's best known, but those were nothing compared to his work in Mr. Punch. He uses photographs, computer alterings, models, paintings, and even some standard, old-fashioned comic book illustrations to full effect, and instead of simply giving us the visual interpretation of Gaiman's story, Dave McKean shows us a whole new way of looking at a story altogether. This isn't a normal panel by panel story. In Dave McKean's world, an insane old man is shown as a series of black and white photographs of a man in a field, a huge, oversized mask covering his face and chest, fists raised, and the mask is a drawing of fury. A meek, frightened little eight-year-old boy is a wire stick figure with a cut-out of a boy's face pasted to the top of the body. A face in profile is a photograph of a woman's face, ripped in half. And a whispered conversation is represented as a photograph of silhouettes seen through cheesecloth. The pictures of the screaming, bleeding puppet baby falling to the ground at the beginning are unsettling and you won't soon forget them.Neil Gaiman has never been one to write big time super-hero comic books, but at least his comics were identifiable as such. Mr. Punch, however, is something else entirely. And when Dave McKean is involved too, it's bound to be something you've never seen before."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"At once a fictive childhood memoir, a bit of cultural history and a psychological mystery, Neil Gaiman's take on Mr. Punch is no less compelling for being so depressing. Like a Chekov play, it is as much what is not said as what is said that is important. A marvelous story that deserves many rereadings."},{"Title":"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch","review":"It's a fourth graphic novel by McKean and Gaiman in my collection.

It's a vaguely nightmarish, jewel-toned story told like a series of serial photographs -- and rather than a retelling of the story of Punch, it's a boy's reflections on the world.A boy and his grandfather go to the beach to fish. Eventually, the kid wanders away and finds a strange little tent neaby... only to have Punch and Judy puppets emerge and do their grisly little performance. This sets the child to thinking about the past, his ancestors and the way that young children are both intimidated by adults and filled with magical ideas.Then his grandfather meets the puppeteer who was on the beach, an old friend who still sees the magic in the old \\"Punch and Judy\\" performances. The old man reintroduces the boy to a world of magic and wonder, and reconnects him to the past of his family.\\"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch\\" is a very striking story -- Gaiman weaves together stories within stories, interlocking and spiraling inward like a seashell's chambers. And though the story centers on a young, rather disillusioned boy who is watching the older generations fade, even as he looks on his own life.And Gaiman's writing is quietly beautiful here -- he fills the story with wooden puppets, faux mermaids, pebbled beaches, and thoughts of childhood's scary magical qualities. There are little shreds of weirdness speckling the main story, like when the boy reflects that his aunt claimed she had a tail. Of course, he had to check.And Dave McKean's art is... weird. A little weirder than the story merits, actually -- half the time the panels are normal, and the rest of the time they look like strange surreal photographs. We have wire boys, comedy masks, rich jewel tones, puppets that look like they were snapped with a camera, and written letters running under the rough-hewn sketches. It's like having your head shoved into a beautiful, surreal junk drawer.\\"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch\\" has a rather deceptive title, but Neil Gaiman's dark spiderweb of a tale is well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Strange brother","review":"While enjoying the nightlife of Harlem in the 1920's, June Westbrook, a recent divorc&eacute;e and newspaper columnist, befriends Mark Thornton, a handsome young man with a secret. As they are leaving one of the clubs, they witness a young, effeminate man named Nelly gets arrested. June pleads with Mark to find out what happened to him.En route to the courthouse the next day, Mark reads a copy of the Penal Code and learns of the horrible laws society has created against men like Nelly - and men like himself. He attends Nelly's trial at which the young man is sentenced to one year in prison for making advances towards another man and for dressing like a woman. Unnerved by what he has seen and read, he decides to tell June everything, believing she is the one person who can understand him.Blair Niles' novel, first published in 1931, is a remarkable study gay life during the 1920's.: the powerfully negative views imposed by society, the feeling of loneliness, the secretiveness that gay men and women followed in order to fit in with society. Her main characters are wonderfully drawn: Mark, who is filled with self-hatred because of the way he feels toward other been and because of societal dislike of men and women such as he; and June, who, instead of behind disgusted by what she hears, is compassionate toward Mark, perhaps because she finds a connection between her and Mark. The supporting characters are equally good, ranging from Mark's \\"mentor\\" Tom Burden, who first helped Mark to realize and to accept what he is, to Seth Vaughan, the object of June's affection.It's not a very negative novel at all, most of the time trying to understand and to show a positive light on homosexuality. I found that refreshing for such an early novel, though Mark does come to the typical tragic end for a homosexual character. Definitely a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Strange brother","review":"June, a young divorcee, becomes friends with Mark, and through him she discovers the world of Harlem nightclubs, drag shows, and the shadowy world of homosexuals. Mark and June are rather alike in that they are both looking unsuccessfully for love. Being gay in the late 1920s is terribly difficult, and Mark struggles with self-hatred instilled in him by society. Even though it portrays society's many prejudices and negative expectations for gays at the time, and the standard-for-the-era tragic ending for the homosexual character, \\"Strange Brother\\" reaches for compassion, understanding, and acceptance. It does somewhat succeed through the character of June who realizes her commonalities with Mark, and chooses to embrace life fully, even after the death of the object of her own affection (not Mark, by the way). \\"Strange Brother\\" is a wonderful story giving readers a glimpse into the early days of moving towards acceptance of gays and lesbians."},{"Title":"The Venetian painters of the renaissance: With an index to their works","review":"This book is in the public domain and is available for free from several websites, so even if Amazon does not offer it (in your area) you can still get it.

The Renaissance hadresulted in the emancipation of the individual, in making him feel thatthe universe had no other purpose than his happiness. This brought anentirely new answer to the question, \\"Why should I do this or that?\\" Itused to be, \\"Because self-instituted authority commands you.\\" The answernow was, \\"Because it is good for men.\\" In this lies our greatest debt tothe Renaissance, that it instituted the welfare of man as the end of allaction. The Renaissance did not bring this idea to practical issue, butour debt to it is endless on account of the results the idea hasproduced in our own days. This alone would have made the Renaissance aperiod of peculiar interest, even if it had had no art whatever. Butwhen ideas are fresh and strong, they are almost sure to find artisticembodiment, as indeed this whole epoch found in painting, and thisparticular period in the works of Tintoretto.[...]"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory","review":"I have just completed reading Professor Ruud's textbook from cover to cover.

Whereas many texts seem to be compendiums of theorems and proofs with little in the way of explanation, Ruud takes the time to explain things thoroughly. At over 800 pages, however, Ruud's book is never verbose. A good explanation takes time, but Ruud never takes more time than is needed. Yet, in addition to all concepts being thoroughly explained, they are introduced with practical examples, and--what is most amazing--the proofs are built up systematically in such a way that you can actually read though them and be enlightened rather than convinced.Previous econometrics texts have a &quot;Losing sight of the forest for the trees&quot; sort of feel to them. Ruud's text, however, works like the old drill Seargent in the Kipling poem who explained his teaching method as &quot;Firsts I tells 'em what I'ms goings to tells em; then I tells 'em; and then I tells 'em what's I tolds 'em.&quot; Ruud does this by first building up the fundamental concept of matrix projection. Then he demonstrates how that can be used to explain Ordinary Least Squares regression. Then he adds onto that all the common assumptions: independent, identically distributed errors; normality of the errors, etc. He builds things up one assumption at a time. And all the while he tells you what he's doing and why the content of each chapter matters and how it is related to what has come before and to what will come afterwards.But, then--in a master stroke of pedagogy--he tears it all down. He starts taking away, one at a time, all the assumptions like normality that he just spent chapters building up and shows how econometricians deal with matters when they *do* in fact remove the standard assumptions. In this way he can introduce consistent estimators, non-linear regression, latent variables, and so on as what they were historically: practical solutions needed when the assumptions of the classical model fail to hold.By systematically showing which assumptions imply which results and then showing how to deal with things when a given assumption fails to hold, Ruud's book produces a better econometrician. Too often have previous books left previous readers unable to really understand the art of data analysis, which involves taking a data set, seeing what assumptions can be fairly made about it, and then analyzing it given those fairly made assumptions.Professor Ruud deserves many plaudits for writing what will surely become the standard text for the next generation of graduate students."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory","review":"This is the best text I have encountered for an advanced graduate text in econometrics. The style is less terse than Amemiya, but Ruud does not skimp on content. There are many (useful) details, particularly on some subjects other authors assume (in my experience, incorrectly) the student knows. Finally, the geometric approach Ruud frequently espouses is somewhat unique in econometric presentation, and one I find quite useful."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory","review":"Econometrics seemed to me a technically demanding subject with results that are either magic (stated without derivation) or based on some arcane mathematical tricks. But after reading Ruud's textbook, econometrics finally makes sense. It provides a great exposition of graduate econometrics with all the main results and techniques clearly spelled out. Furthermore, it actually has derivations of the results. I also really like the emphasis on the geometry behind econometrics; it provides a systematic approach and the results even become intuitive.So, if you want more than just a recipe book and actually understand econometrics, read this book!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory","review":"This is another good, modern textbook on parametric, cross-sectional econometrics (don't look for non/semi-parametric or time-series econometrics in here). It is, I think, in the same league as Wooldridge, which is however less technical and spends more time describing empirical applications. I think Ruud is a very nice addition to an econometric shelf. The notation is good, and the math/stat appendix is one of the best I have ever seen (the section on multivariate differentiation in particular is outstanding and very useful). Overall, if you want to have 3 *relatively* basic books on parametric cross-section econometrics, I think this is a good companion to Wooldridge and Cameron and Trivedi (a nice compendium of applied tools, which also includes some non-parametrics, for which the best introduction is likely Pagan and Ullah). If time-series is important to you, Hayashi is a good choice. As you may have guessed, I am not a big fan of Greene, which I do own but never look at."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory","review":"My only complaint about this text is that it overemphasizes the properties of least squares estimators when the regressor matrix does not have full column rank.

The first part of the book is pretty good, intuitively explains what an OLS regression is really like geometrically. The second part of the book is just horrible.

Though there are many partial translations available, this is the most comprehensive. In 5 volumes, the authors translate about 35% of the full text of the Zohar. It only translates the main core of the Zohar, the part that interprets the Bible. The rest of the books of the Zohar are omitted. Sometimes the translation seems to be inaccurate, and notes are very sparse, so a good knowledge of Kabbalah is recommended. Comes with introduction, glossary, and explanatory essays. A good buy if you're interested in Kabbalah."},{"Title":"Zohar (5 Volume set)","review":"This five volume set offers the best translation of the Zohar available in English as yet. While it does not contain the entire Zohar, it offers enough so that if one feels inclined, they may also read the Kabbalah centre translation. What is refreshing about the soncino edition is they did not add commentary to the text like so many other translators do. This is the problem with such translations as the one by Daniel Matt or the Kabbalah centre, while their commentary may have some jewls of wisdom in it, the bulk is very misleading, and reptative. In Daniel Matt's translation, he also misplaces certain esoteric sections of the Zohar into a separate book, like a section describing the chambers in the palace of light. Not knowing that All sections were placed in their order for a reason. For these reasons, I would recomend the soncino edition. And because the Zohar is so obscure, it is a good idea to study it with someone who knows the text most intimately from a mystical perscective, without such a guide, one will likely find reading the Zohar confusing and cryptic.The Ari of safed used to engadge in a practice where he would read a section of the Zohar over and over and over until he could see what it meant. This is actualy the only way that I know of to understand the Zohar.The Zohar is a great jewel of wisdom for those who can look and see.Praise the most High!"},{"Title":"Zohar (5 Volume set)","review":"Despite the length (over 2000 pages) this English translation is only a part of the actual Sepher ha Zohar (Book of Splendor). The rest was to a large degree untranslatable due to its symbology, plays on words, etc. Yet, the authors (and it took a team to do it) did a great service to Kabbalah in particular and mysticism in general but completing this herculean effort. The Zohar presents itself as a Midrash or commentary on the Bible. This is an ancient literary form. It attributes its authorship to Shimon bar Yohai, an ancient Kabbalistic master who is also the main character in the book. To a large degree, the book is about the wanderings of this itinerant master with his disciples--especially their discussions and encounters. Gershom Scholem attributes the work to Moses de Leon in medieval Spain. de Leon claimed that he discovered the text but didn't write it. Moshe Idel argues that de Leon (judging from his other works, for example) could not have written it alone, was evidently part of a Kabbalistic circle of masters including Joseph Gikatilla, and that it was written by the group (perhaps based on a discovered scrap or fragment). Who knows? The work stands on its own as the reputedly greatest Kabbalistic work of all time. However, anyone at all familiar with Kabbalah knows how steeped in symbolism it was. Indeed, much of it was passed on by word of mouth. Thus, publication of the Zohar was a watershed event. The only other great work that might rival it, Moses Cordovero's \\"Garden of Pomegranetes,\\" has not been translated into English, unfortunately. The Simon, Sperling, et al translation is by far the most comprehensive (as far as I know) and does include some descriptions and analysis, but it is most definitely NOT a commentary on the Zohar. Most of them are one volume long and not all that helpful (see Scholem's or Yehuda Liebes's commentaries). So, whatever you do, do NOT make this your first read Kabbalah book. Rather, read some of the numerous introductory books (e.g. \\"Introduction to Cabala\\" by Halevi) or any of many others. Then try some intermediate texts and commentaries such as those of Aryeh Kaplan (he did commentaries on the Bahir, Sepher Yetzirah, and Nachman's Tales) and, above all read lots of Gershom Scholem's works, especially \\"Kabbalah\\" and \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism.\\" Then, and only then, try this book. Its a challenge, but well worth the time for those who are ready for it. I found it to be complicated and very variable as to style. There are straight-forward (though symbolic to a degree) teaching stories as well as rather mysterious passages of unknown intention. It should be noted that the Zohar includes some later additions such as the Tikkuney Zohar which sometimes conflict with the basic text. This is a book for the serious student of Kabbalah. For such folks, however, it is indispensible."},{"Title":"Zohar (5 Volume set)","review":"This set of books has the Potential to be SUPER. However, the set that I received has serious FLAWS. Book III is missing part of the last chapter and also the Glossary. The last chapter in Book V is NOT Ha'azinu, as it should be, but it is Shemini which is a repeat of the last chapter from Book IV. Also, the Appendix is missing from this Book V. Not the seller's fault unless they knew about this. I see the publisher, Soncino Press as the perpetrator of the crime here. Caveat Emptor. CHECK YOUR BOOKS."},{"Title":"Zohar (5 Volume set)","review":"This edition of the Zohar is not the complete text of the Zohar, however it is a complete translation of its commentary on the Pentateuch.

And at less than $100, a bargain compared to the 23 volume Kabbalah Center version, and the now 6 volume out of a planned total of 12 volumes Pritzker edition. If you want the entire Zohar get one of those editions, but if you want the core of the Zohar's teachings, beyond what you can get in an introduction to Kabbalah book, then this is the perfect collection in my opinion."},{"Title":"Zohar (5 Volume set)","review":"In my opinion this is the ONLY Zohar I will point another student to in English.Those who complain some sections are missing know not the impossibility of translating those sections without extreme conjecture.This 5 Volume set is plenty for any serious student to study for many years.

This is something I would recommend to fans of Batman to read for the sake of the importance to the Batman story line, but I probably wouldn't recommend to many others. In fact even if you're a Batman fan and you don't have a lot of money to through around there a lot of other Batman stories I'd point to before this one. Now I don't want to say that this is that bad of a story I was entertained and never thought about not finishing reading it.I think the biggest problem for me was the fact that most of the time it didn't feel like the Batman universe. It just seems odd having Batman run around in the Middle East. Now having been a fan of comics for a number of years now, I have come to know that often I will be asked to suspend my disbelief. But a few times it took it a little too far form me in this one. For example it seems a little too coincidental that Batman follows the Joker to the same city in the Middle East that Jason Todd ran off to looking for his mom. Two other examples are Batman bringing gliders and a mini helicopter with him to the Middle East/Africa. And the Joker being recruited as Iran's ambassador by Ayatollah Khomeini. I don't know it could just be me but I thought that was a bit much.There were a few good things about it to though. While I wouldn't say the art work was amazing or anything, I thought it was pretty good and reminded me of the artwork in some of the older Batman comics (I mean that in a good way). I also liked the fact that the story addressed that when the Joker got out of Arkham he was without most of his assets and need to make some money to get started up again. In short I recommend this for the historical aspects rather than a great story."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Main redeeming factor was the death of Jason Todd.

The whole thing was probably more exciting at the time it came out and people were able to vote to decide whether or not Robin died. However, upon reading it now, the whole story is rather medicore. The plot has gigantic holes in it even for an 80's superhero comic. Batman and Robin travel around the world and everything and everyone they are looking for falls into their lap repeatedly. The art in the story is average, but certain scenes are very poorly done. The only thing that saves this book from being banished from my mind altogther is the fact that despite the shortcomings, it is a pretty entertaining read and it has a strong finish."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This book is one of the most unfortunate comics still in print. The premise -- comics readers being asked to give thumbs-up or thumbs-down to a difficult, unpopular, but still important character -- was awful, and put blood on the hands of a lot of readers. The plot is rather ludicrous, full of coincidences and lots of Jason Todd jetting from place to place to little purpose. The force of Jason Todd's death -- which had so much resonance in, for instance, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" -- has since been rather muted by the new, wonderful Robin guided by Chuck Dixon. (You wonder if Jason Todd could have matured into this Robin, given the chance.) Still, the Joker is used well in the story, Superman is effective, and there are several striking and memorable scenes. This is an important story in the ongoing saga of the Bat, but I suggest that it stands as a monument to a tragic and irreversible editorial decision rather than as a triumphant Batman story along the lines of \\"Dark Knight\\" or \\"The Killing Joke.\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I'm sure everyone who is even remotely familiar with Batman's background knows this story. Even if you haven't read it, the cover says it all. Robin dies. Although he was not the first or last Robin, it still sent ripples through the Batman canon that are still creating waves today (i.e. Under the Hood, Countdown).I have to admit, this is the first story I ever read with Jason Todd as Robin. I knew a little bit about him but it's a little pathetic that before I even got to know the guy, he's gone. However, Starlin does take the time to fill in a little back story for those like me that may not have a clue as to who this Robin is or where he came from. It made me want to start backtracking and read a little bit more about him while he was alive so I could appreciate his departure more.The basic story is after Bruce grounds Jason from active duty as Robin, Jason comes across his birth certificate indicating that his mother who he thought to be dead was in fact not his real mother and that she may still be out there. After some detective work he narrows it down to three women and goes off in search of her. Meanwhile The Joker is up to no good selling a nuke to terrorists in the middle east and Batman is on his trail. By a huge coincidence Bruce and Jason run into each other and end up helping each other with their missions.Other than the unlikeliness of their journeys intersecting, the rest of the rest of the story plays out rather well with a few surprises as in addition to some good action and dialog. Starlin manages to make Jason's last moments meaningful and character defining. Jim Aparo's artwork is also pitch perfect and works really well in telling the story.Although the story is not quite as epic as I had expected, it must have been mind blowing when it was first printed. The fact that leading up to his death you never see it coming would have been the best reading experience. It seems like just a simple story of Jason trying to dig deeper into his past and Joker up to his old tricks and then they hit you with a ton of bricks out of nowhere. I'd say that is a pretty hard thing to pull off well and that is why this story sets the stage for the rest of Batman's career."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Batman: A Death in the Family is arguably the most controversial comic book storyline of all time - and everything about it is just great except for DC's reaction to the fan reaction to the death of Jason Todd (the second Robin). The revolutionary thing about the series is the fact that DC set up a hotline and allowed readers to decide Robin's fate after he was caught in an explosion in issue 428. A slight majority of the 10,000+ callers (in a window of only 36 hours) gave Jason Todd the thumbs down, and so it was that Batman once again became the lone Dark Knight (for a little while, at least). And the media hoopla commenced - which was, however much they still deny it, DC's plan all along.Jason Todd was always a problematic Robin, but he had been getting more and more reckless - so much so that Batman finally takes him off active duty. Then Todd finds out that the woman he called Mother was not really his mother, and he sets out on a quest to find his biological mother - he has three names, and it's just a matter of finding each woman on the list. The search takes him to Beirut. Meanwhile, the Joker has escaped yet again, and it looks like he's trying to sell a nuclear weapon to terrorists in the Middle East. Fate dictates that the lives of all three major players intersect at a vicious crossroads overseas. What is most shocking about this story arc is not the death of Robin - rather, it is the manner of his death. His newly discovered mother basically betrays him, the Joker beats him to a bloody pulp with a crowbar (and really enjoys doing it), and then he's trapped inside a warehouse when it blows up. Still, even after the betrayal, he tries to save his mother's life - it makes for a truly fitting, superheroic end for the second Robin. The story doesn't stop there, though. Even as Batman is grieving Jason's death and questioning all of his actions and decisions regarding the boy, the Joker gets himself a job as the UN ambassador for Iran. That gives him diplomatic immunity, meaning Batman, no matter how much he wants to finally put an end to the Joker, can't touch him. The State Department sends Superman in to break the news to Batman, and for a while it looks like Bats and Sup are going to go at it. Batman knows that nothing good will come of the Joker's upcoming address to the General Assembly - and he's right. Still, the storyline closes on a note of ambiguity, which is almost how it had to be. The whole traumatic experience puts the dark back in the Dark Knight and has definite repercussions for the future development of Batman.Here's my take on this Robin-ocide thing. DC created in Jason Todd a problematic character whom, to make matters worse, they did not develop in a very good fashion. A lot of Batman fans truly disliked this brash, young kid who whined all the time and was clearly never ready to fill Robin's shoes. How can we undo the wrong and get rid of Jason Todd?, they must have asked. We all know the plan they developed - let the fans decide whether he lives or dies. How relieved they must have been that the vote narrowly went their way and sealed Todd's fate. This had the double bonus of letting them blame the fans for Robin's death - and they did so, at every opportunity. What really sticks in my craw, though, is their reported astonishment at the media circus this decision created. I mean, come on, this whole scheme was designed as a publicity coup - and a pretty brilliant one, as it turned out. Here we are almost 18 years later, and we're still talking about and debating A Death in the Family. (Of course, DC recently made the extremely stupid decision of actually resurrecting Jason Todd - as a villain - in Batman: Under the Hood, despite editor Denny O'Neil's quote on the back of the A Death in the Family TPB saying what a \\"really sleazy stunt\\" it would be to ever bring him back.)"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I found this book to be one of Jim Starlin'sand Jim Aparo's best efforts.

Killing off Robin (Due to a reader's poll so the readers killed him, not the writers) was both risky and created a fascinating edge to Batman. The Joker, in usual maniacal form here, weaves his sinister plots as Jason tries to find his long-lost mother. With real emotion, sharp action and an incredible finale, this is possibly the best in the Batman comic series. The artwork is deep, dark and complementive.

Jason Todd's Robin was a small blip and is most interesting and important for this series of four issues which chronicle his very bloody death. It certainly is not the best writing by Jim Starlin but the appearance by Superman later helps and the idea of the Joker becoming the ambassador of Iran is so ridiculous it almost works. Jim Aparo puts in adequate drawings, down a notch from his best work in the early Brave and Bold, and still seeming a little downtown Neal Adamish.

Robin's anger turns to excitement when he realises his true mother may still be alive. Through his ensuing search, and some illegal weapons deals between the Joker and Arab terrorists, Batman, Robin, and the Joker somehow follow each other to the same far-flung spots on the globe, before the tragic outcome voted for by fans.I certainly didn't dislike Robin in this comic - he was petulant, but obviously hurting, and the writers gave him a dramatic and emotionally weighty send-off. But the plot that leads to it is a series of coincidences that requires too much suspension of disbelief; how the three main characters can end up involved with the same people in the same places so many times doesn't really hold weight.Far-fetched plots are one thing; but the politics of the story I found difficult to stomach - the portrayal of Arabs is stereotypical and offensive; neither do I particularly appreciate seeing Batman beat a woman senseless and then drug her against her will - for this reason, and for the sake of giving the plot a bit more credibility, the second of the three candidates for the role of Jason's mother should have been omitted; Woosan's involvement in the story added very little.The Joker, as always, is a repulsive pervert - his face is well-sketched as a portrait of pure insanity. His use of politics to protect himself from persecution could have been an effective idea, but again the racist backdrop to it spoiled the whole thing; given the forthcoming Batman vs Osama, one has to ask: do the PNAC sponsor Batman or something?All in all, this comic series was certainly worth the money - I just wish the creators had indulged in a bit less political immaturity."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I can't believe Jim Frickin Starlin wrote this storyline.DC realized they'd made a mistake by making this new Robin such a badass. He was totally unlikable. So they made a decision whether by killing him outright, or giving him a mortal wound they would write him out. We get a hackneyed \\"looking for my birth mother\\" script with just too many ridiculous coincidences. (One candidate just happens to be a Batman villan, another just happens to be dealing with the Joker). What crap. Then on top of that, the Iranians, (this was pre-Gulf War remember) make the Joker a citizen and a delegate. Even in the comic-book world its impossible to surrender belief this much. Starlin probably needs to stick to the outer-space cosmic sagas.But there are good points: the characterization of Batman comes through shining bright. He's visibly shaken now. For the first time, he contemplates murder. He blames himself. We also see more of the contentious relationship between himself and Superman.But one thing about this book -- it changed the Bat universe for all time; the Joker is now in a class by himself among Bat-foes;(it got personal, you might say) Jason Todd's memory continues even until this day, and of course it led to the introduction of the new, extremely popular Robin Tim Drake. (Who would have ever thunk that the sidekick could sustain a 100+ solo title run?)Of course, all that stuff comes in several successive books, not here.

Buy it."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Before I even knew who Jason Todd was, I knew there was a Robin who died. I didn't start reading comics much up until recently, but I have always Loved watching the cartoons (Batman the animated series, Batman Beyond,justice league, and even a bunch of marvel cartoons including spiderman and the x-men) because my dad used to collect comic book movies.Sometime a year or two ago my husband and I were bored and headed to a local redbox to find some entertainment for the night. Under the Red Hood just happened to be in stock and as soon as we read the description the rabid geeks in us were like \\"OMG we have to see this tonight!!\\" Finally I was gonna learn a little something about Bat History! We were just blown away! If anything inspired My husband and I to start trying to read comics besides The Dark Knight movies, it was Under the Red Hood the animated film alone. We own the bluray now and have watched all the documentaries on that disk more than once. We decided to get A death in the Family as we started collecting and I just finished reading it. I was not disappointed in any way, shape, or form! And I still almost cried when Jason died (even though I knew it was going to happen anyways.) It took a tremendous amount of willpower to maintain my composure. The animation is also very good because You see sooooo much pain on Batman's face as he holds the young man hopelessly in his arms.It is now one of my top 3 and I have a feeling it will always be there. I did not find Jason to be the nasty smart @$$ brute people claimed he was. Was he reckless, yes. Ruthless, a little. Human, Absolutely. More so than anybody in the bat family ever has been. If ever he was a jerk in the comics, as soon as you open up the pages you start to see him grow as a character and quickly at that. Which makes losing him at the end of the story all the more painfully profound and moving. You also see more of Batman's humanity too. You see how deeply he loves and cares even though he would never tell a soul. Most importantly, it reminds you that Batman is not infallible! It's a painful eye opener about what it costs to be \\"The Batman.\\" It also raises the untimely question, What Price is too high for \\"Justice?\\" This book is a MUST if you have any interest in the graphic novels featuring Batman and it is as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. That is some strong staying power for a graphic novel that is almost a quarter of a century old.Lastly, what makes this edition extra awesome is that you get two 5 star stories for the price of one. A Lonely place of Dying (the follow up) is included in this book as well and that story is equally wonderful and powerful. You see how much of a difference one random act of kindness from many years ago can make. The impact has the potential to be HUGE! You see exactly how much one moment can change your life. Whether it's for the better or the worse, it's completely up to you. And as a Fan Favorite, Tim Drake is a completely accessible, sympathetic, and rich character full of depth. He has incredible courage inspired by the compassion and enthusiasm only a child could have. This child is also a wise and very bright one, so it's fascinating getting a peek into how his young mind works."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I purchase this product off of ebay for a similar price. I enjoy the volume, but I will admit that this volume is only for a select audience that knows a lot about Batman and Jason Todd. With that said here are the reasons to buy this book. If these reasons do not apply to you then do not buy it. If they do then you will enjoy it very much1. It is a major story development in Batman history. This is the first Robin that died while in Batman's care. The Robins are like Batman's son and to witness his death and knowing it was his fault is scarring. This event can be more scarring then watching your parents get murder and then dressing up likes a bat to fight criminals at night... So get this volume for posterity.2.

A shocking story which made the Batman into a different man, severing his ties with the concept of Robin, as well as his pseudo-friendship with Superman."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Anyone who has followed the Batman comics over the years knows what kind of impact the death of the Jason Todd-era Robin had on the Batman mythos, but the outcome makes more impact than the overall story. A Death in the Family is a solid tale of the Dark Knight seeking justice for the death of Jason at the hands of the Joker, but just about everything about this story comes off as lame. Jim Starlin's writing is cliche, and the Joker becoming the ambassador of Iran? Please. Now I know this is a comic book, and I'm as much a comic geek as the next guy, but that is plain old ridiculous. What saves A Death in the Family worthwhile (somewhat) is the emotional impact of the outcome, and the solid art by Jim Aparo is a nice touch, but if it weren't for the impact this would leave on the Batman mythos, this wouldn't be worth picking up at all. What would have been a nice bonus though, would be if DC would include the alternate outcome of the story (fans could call in and vote whether or not Robin would live or die) which I'm sure they have laying around somewhere, which would be a nice extra to fans who remember when this storyarc hit."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"The original edition of Death in the Family only included that 1988 story, but this new edition also includes the 1989 follow-up, A Lonely Place of Dying, and that is a plus. However, this is one of the worst Batman stories. Denny O'Neill's final Batman story involves the second Robin, Jason Todd, embarking on a quest to discover the true identity of his mother, because she can only be (get this) an Israeli secret agent, a deadly assasin, or a crusading doctor, all of whom have names that begin with S and happened to be listed in his father's phone book. The plot betrays its 1980s origins with stop-offs in famine-plagued Ethiopia and civil war-torn Lebanon before the Joker brutually kills Jason Todd (SPOILER ALERT for a 25-year old story that made headlines in its day). Fans were given the opportunity to call a 1-900 number to decide Robin's fate (the original ad is included in this collection). The plot then sinks further into ridiculousness, with the Joker allying with the Ayatollah and becoming the Iranian ambassador to the UN. Then Superman shows up to tell Batman that he can't kill the Joker because it would create an international incident. . . A Death in the Family attempts to answer one of genre fiction's most perplexing questions: Why wouldn't a hero like Batman kill a truly evil monster like the Joker? Its answer is as typical a copout as a time travel story that ends with \\"We can't change the terrible events of the past because it would destroy the future!\\" Nevertheless, this story of the death of Robin is an important stop in the history of Batman.The followup story, A Lonely Place of Dying, is better-written. It introduces the third Robin, Tim Drake. The focus of the plot in this story is on Two-Face, and while A Lonely Place of Dying is nearly ruined by an endless parallel narration by Two-Face and Batman, just to show that they're, you know, two sides of the same coin, it does finally establish exactly why Robin is a necessary element in Batman stories. A Death in the Family is far from the greatest Batman story, and while it certainly isn't the worst, it's definitely pretty high on that list."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"The book is about the death of Jason Todd the second Robin.

Great story overall"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"For Batman, the death of his parents was the biggest tragedy of his life. They were both taken away from him by two bullets. Bullets shot by a random mugger. Bullets that would scar Bruce Wayne for the rest of his life.Bullets that would lead him into becoming the Batman.He was motivated by the loss of his parents to rid Gotham City of the criminal element that took his parents lives. He would carry that promise for the rest of his life. But he would not do it alone....for he had Robin, The Boy Wonder.And the decision to recruit him into his dangerous mission would ultimately lead to tragedy....THE DEATH OF THE SECOND ROBIN, JASON TODD.Yes, I did say \\"second\\" Robin, because more than one person has worn the mantle of Robin. The first person to become Robin was Dick Grayson, who was the most well known Robin, as he wore the costume from the late 30's, all the way to the mid 70's. But Dick soon outgrew the role, and set off alone as the adult crime fighter Nightwing. Batman would continue to fight solo, until he met Jason Todd, a troubled orphan who literally tried to steal the tires off the batmobile. Batman felt sorry for the young boy and decided to take him in as the second Robin. But Jason Todd never set well with readers of the day. He was reckless, brutal, and was fueled by his anger. While I myself never had a problem with this (I actually thought it was an interesting depiction of Robin), the readers continued to complain about Jason, and the editorial board at DC decided they had to do something about it. But since the couldn't figure out what to do, they decided to let the readers choose Robin's fate!The story itself shows that Batman is starting to realize that Jason's recklessness is becoming a serious problem. In order to keep his anger under control (and to not let himself get killed), Batman forces Jason to go off active duty. When Jason hears about this, he angrily leaves the Wayne Manor, and walks towards his old apartment in Crime Alley. When he gets there, he finds a startling discovery. He finds his birth certificate, where his mother, Catherine Todd's signature isn't there. Instead, there is a blacked out name starting with the letter \\"S\\" in its place. Realizing that Catherine Todd was not his mother, he travels across the world to search for his real mother. His search leads him to the Middle East, where the Joker is busy selling nuclear weapons to Arab terrorists. I bet your wondering why he would be doing trade with terrorists. Well it's because the police started seizing his funds after he recently crippled Barbra Gordon in THE KILLING JOKE, and he's trying to recover his lost money. Plus he's also insane! When the Joker finds Jason, he takes advantage of the opportunity, and beats the boy wonder near to death before leaving him to die in an explosion.This where the readers were able to decide Robin's fate. DC Comics gave the fans two phone numbers. One would allow Jason to survive the explosion, and the other would send him into his grave. In the end, the death phone number won by a slim margin, and Jason was found dead in the rumble by Batman. A scene that will have you moving with tears.The story about Robin's death may be controversial, but it's an amazing story that plays a key role in the life of the dark knight! Jason's death shows us the risks that Batman is taking by allowing a young boy to fight crime along side him, and transforms Batman into more of a loner as he limits his partnerships with his other allies in the future. But more importantly, this story makes Batman's obsession with the Joker even more personal. During the 1980's, the Joker was becoming a darker and more murderous foe as his crimes became more heinous. A powerful example of this was in Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE (a personal favorite of mine), as he cripples Barbra Gordon in an attempt to drive her father insane. He ended her career as Batgirl with a single bullet, and has know gone over the edge once again by murdering the boy wonder. These two crimes would cause Batman to no longer hold back on the Joker, and in some cases, would even be tempted to break his one rule with the Joker. In short, these factors make Jason Todd's death the second greatest tragedy in Batman's life.It's a tale that will truly move you away, and prepare you for how Batman will decide his actions in the future. Controversial or not, I will always treasure this as a truly sensational story of the dark knight!May Jason Todd rest in peace..."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This best selling 1980s graphic novel let the readers decide if the second Robin, Jason Todd, would live or die after an explosion. In this late 80s graphic novel there's an actual copy of the advertisement and the 900 number to call to decide upon the fate of the Boy Wonder. The fans decided they didn't like Jason Todd much and voted to kill him and no that isn't a spoiler based on the title and cover. Apparently the vote was close. Over 10,000 votes were cast, with the final vote being 5,343 votes for Jason to die over 5,271 for him to live (Wiki). There is a copy of the cover which shows Jason Todd surviving (in case the fans voted for him to live).The story in of itself ranges from very good to questionable. I don't want to give spoilers but some felt the Joker to Africa connection was too coincidental and others didn't like the Joker and Iran connection though back in those days I think there was a lot of hostility towards possible Middle Eastern terrorists and look what happened during 9-11 so maybe it's not so farfetched or maybe it still is? Additionally, the graphic novel covered issues that concerned the country/world at the time: the IRA, Reaganomics, the Lebanese War, nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, Iran, rogue states, the famine in Ethiopia, Iran-Contra affair and much more.After the death of Robin II you get to see the Batman going down the wrong road even though his friends try to guide him back to the light (he even punches Superman surprisingly). It isn't really until Tim Drake (the future Robin III obviously) takes action on his own and brings Dick Grayson, the first Robin who is now Nightwing, to his senses that Batman begins to recover. For those not in the know Robin serves as a reminder of who Batman/Bruce Wayne used to be before his parents were horribly murdered before his eyes.The artwork is traditionally classic with a distinctive almost bright blue coloring to Batman (which makes it really hard to believe he can surprise people in the desert by sneaking around) which I haven't seen in a while. Also, emoting obvious emotions is more prevalent than in later comics.IGN comics ranked this as #15 on the top 25 Batman graphic novels.At the time this was presented the killing of superhero characters was a new thing. These days they die and then come back with the old bait and switch or when writers want to look for some reason to bring them back. Denny O'Neil, editor of the Bat-comics at the time of Todd's death, stated on the back cover of A Death in the Family trade paperback: \\"It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.\\" However, O'Neil would later regret his decision. Uh huh.This is a must read for Batman fans simply for its history. Get it.ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; BATMAN MYTHOLOGY/FRESHNESS: A minus (for its time); STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; WHEN READ: June to July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Batman: A Death in the Family is an amazing story describing Jason Todd's final days as Robin.

This story is from a time when comics were about the story telling and not gimmicks. Jason Todd's death was groundbreaking and if you read this you will see why. I did not grow up with the J.T. Robin but became a fan of Batman and bunch in the mid 90's, so Tim Drake era. With that said, I didn't have much of an appreciation for Jason Todd as I never read about him. This tale actually made me care about the kid. When you see Joker commit the heinous act on Jason that led to his death, it was gripping. I miss the fact that super hero comics no longer bear their teeth in stories like this did. The artwork was also good for me, it was clean and simple but brought depth to the story telling, something you don't see in recent years.This edition with the inclusion of the origin of Tim Drake is a nice addition, but I could have lived without it. It's just not as gripping as the death of Jason Todd."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"It had been heralded as a milestone by some, a work of tawdry cynicism by others. Regardless of how one feels about Jason Todd's death (pre-retcon), what are the merits of \\"A Death in the Family\\" as a story? To be frank, their aren't many; the case that eventually leads the Robin to his death begins with the Joker taking on a painfully out-of-character role as a (Farsi-speaking) international arms dealer. Sure, he has the same maniacal grin and disregard for human life, but while the Joker is traditionally handled as a madman causing mayhem just for the sake of it, here he acts far too much like a stereotypical money-hungry villain in possession of out-character-motivations and abilities. That the Joker's Farsi-speaking is unrealistic is not the problem (no Batman reader should complain of such a thing); the problem is that it disregards everything we know of the character. Had the (dubious) polling not resulted in Robin's death, this story would have been forgotten, except maybe as a gimmicky one-off experiment in reader participation.Saving this collection, though, is the second half story line, \\"A Lonely Place of Dying.\\" Not only introducing Tim Drake as a worthy successor, not to Todd, but to Dick Grayson, \\"A Lonely Place\\" also serves to justify Robin's existence: He keeps Batman balanced, helps him remember his own youth, and makes him a better strategic crime-fighter (perhaps because of Batman more careful when more than just his life is at stake, but this is left up to the reader to decide). Furthermore, the link between Batman and Two-Face, old friends before the villain's mental and psychological scarring, is explored through a sublime bit of parallelism in which both characters are shown considering their rival's own strategic gifts and how they can counteract them. For all of these reasons, \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\" is a splendid piece of Batman storytelling, making this collection worth buying despite the shortcomings of \\"A Death in the Family.\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I loved this graphic novel .

Still, both stories are excellent, and either of them alone would make this collection worthwhile.\\"A Death in the Family\\" takes place before LPOD, and as you probably know, deals with the demise of Jason Todd, the second Robin. I won't go into plot summary too much, but I do have some non-spoiling thoughts on this story. First of all, the artwork is okay. Not great, not terrible, and certainly outdated. It's not even the drawings that are the problem, but how they're colored. The colors were much mor elimited in the '80s, and that's why people who should be colored with black hair, actually have blue hair in this story.Next, even though I was eager to see Todd be killed, something odd happened: I actually found myself caring for him and wishing against his death. The creative team was able to get me attached to the character, even though I had no particular fondness for him before reading this. Somehow I found myself dreading his death.They made it very emotional and sad--two good things.The story was not, however, perfect. I felt that Batmna recapped things too often. Something would happen, then Batman would recap, then something else would happen, and then you'd get the whole story told to you again. It felt a bit unnecessary, seeing as I don't forget things every three seconds.Another thing I didn't like was how often Batman reiterated that the reason he had not killed the Joker in the past was because the Joker is insane, and therefore, not responsible for his actions. 1) Batman doens't care if you're insane or not. If you're a criminal, he treats you how he sees fit. 2) That's not the only reason Batman hasn't killed him! How about Batman's No Kill Rule? It doesn't matter whether or not the Joker's insane, because Batman would never kill him anyway.*SPOILER*However, there comes a part where Batman pretty much leave sthe Joker to die. WRONG!! He would NEVER do that!*Spoiler End*Overall, I felt the ending was a little incomplete. Batman pretty much sums it up perfectly when he says, \\"Unresolved.\\" There should have been a few more pages, either showing Batman's grief, following the Joker's story, having Batman talk with Superman . . . Anything! Any sort of epilogue would have been better than none.I know I spent most of the review criticizing DITF, but I did enjoy it a lot. The story was really good and I liked how both the page number for each issue was given, as well as the page number for the overall story. DITF is probably about 7.5/10 and LPOD is over 9/10.

This blew my mind. It was just something I didn't see coming! Obviously you can tell what happens by the title and the cover but the way it happens just is sad but heroic in a way. This story starts out with Robin having some emotional difficulty dealing with the death of his parents. He decides to take a walk to blow off some steam after Batman decides to take him out of action after he attacked a group of thugs without taking caution. While on his walk Robin runs into a lady who bought some of his family's items when they were being sold. Robin looks trough them and finds his birth certificate. Robin (or Jason) realizes that his mom Catherine Todd (Now known as his STEP MOTHER!!!! (gasp) ) wasn't his real mom but actually it was someone who's name starts with an S!

Meanwhile Jason Todd aka Robin is working through some emotional issues and finds out that the woman he thought was his mother wasn't his biological mother so he sets off to track down his real mum.I know this book is always on peoples' lists of \\"must-read\\" Batman stories but, besides Jason's death, there really isn't anything particularly good about this story. There are too many coincidences - Jason's search for his mother takes him to Israel, Lebanon, and Ethiopia, to find each of the three women who could potentially be his mum; these places also happen to be where the Joker goes to sell his missile/make money, and of course Batman and Robin cross paths in each instance!Then there's the Joker. First off I hate how he's drawn in the \`80s, his face is ridiculously long like an Easter Island sculpture. Second, I hate how his entire motivation in this book is money. I realise the Joker of the 21st century is far cooler, just think of that scene in \\"The Dark Knight\\" when Heath Ledger's Joker burns an enormous pile of money, but did Jim Starlin have to make his Joker so pathetically hung up on cash? In one scene when Joker's money is destroyed he slinks away in the shadows whining \\"My lovely money... whatever will I do now...?\\" - so pathetic.And then there are the strange nuances with Batman and Robin. In the middle of a desert Batman and Robin take down Arab guards and don their gear, but they manage to pick the guards that suit their superhero outfits so Batman gets a blue robes and Robin red robes. Then Batman says something about covering a large amount of terrain using something that will make them \\"invisible\\" - hang-gliders! He reasons that anyone looking at them will think they're birds. Yeah, birds have jets don't they? Robin's outfit too is really stupid. Those bare legs and little green scaly shorts look so daft it's a wonder they got away with it for so long.When Jason dies, Batman gives a summary of his life and gives a lame reason for wanting to have a child as a sidekick fighting criminals at night - \\"I guess I was just lonely\\". But he vows to \\"never again\\" allow a minor to help him fight villains as evil as Joker and Two-Face. Right, except right after this he meets Tim Drake and trains him to become the new Robin. Sigh... I don't know why Starlin tried to reason Robin into existence, just accept that it's weird but it is what it is. He's a colourful moving target to draw gunfire away from the guy dressed in black (or blue in this book). Move on.I'll give credit to Starlin for making the death scene very stark and brutal, though the events afterwards that keep Batman from attacking Joker completely negate any of the impact because you're wondering how on earth such nonsense made it into print. The Joker becomes ambassador for Iran, that bugbear of Cold War 1980s America. Yes, ambassador. What absolute rubbish.This is such a bad \`80s comic book full of poor dialogue and plotting and that cheesy comic book style of drawing that instantly dates it, that it's amazing it's held in the high regard it is. It's reputation must be held up by aging fanboys who look back on this era with nostalgia and ignore the fact that the Batman books of this time (barring a few exceptions) were mostly terrible and can't hope to stand up to the generally high quality of the Batman books being written today. I suppose every Batman fan must read this if only for the mythology aspect of it, but it's not even the end of Jason Todd. He comes back in Judd Winick's \\"Under the Hood\\", so that the book's sombre and dark cover underlines the silliness of superhero comics in general - characters come back all the time, there are never any real endings.Anybody looking for a fun Batman read will not find it here, nor is it a deserved classic; \\"A Death in the Family\\" is just a book that happens to have an event in it that some consider to be important but really isn't. Definitely missable, this is ultimately a disappointing read."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I gave this a 4 out of 5. Not because I don't understand how great and a must read this comic is, but that I also see the datedness of the story. It was a big deal back in the day. People were asked to vote for Robin to live or die, and this isn't the original Robin. This was the Robin after Dick grew up and became Nightwing, but before Tim Drake. This was when Jason Todd was Robin. He was both loved and hated by Batman fans. I didn't care for him in some ways, but that is because I felt Tim Drake was a better Robin and earned the right to be Robin in the story arch that follows this one called A Lonely Place of Dying.This is a big event in Batman's life. It is a story of his failure, even if it was out of his control. This was going to haunt Batman for the rest of his career. It would be like loosing a son to him and failing his parents all over. It is a good story, and a must read for any fan. However, towards the end it gets a bit dated and unnecessary. Without giving away much of the plot there is an appearance of a former Iranian leader allying himself with The Joker and many mentions of Reganomics. I felt gave the comic a bit of datedness and a sour taste. It felt a little political at the end and took away from the main story and ended up being a bit corny. It just left me with a sour taste, although over all its a great story.Overall its a great story and well worth the price. If you like this story I'd suggest getting A Lonely Place of Dying afterwards, its a great read and definitely moves the Batman story arc forward."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This story is a bit dated having originally being published in the 1980s, but still a good read overall.

The plotting was sloppier than a mid-season sitcom, too much suspension of disbelief in all details that sell a story (the friend of the Todds, the names of possible people in the book, the fact that all 3 were alive and \\"interesting\\" people (why one of them couldn't be a coffeeshop waitress or something, esp if they came from Crime Alley). Perhaps the worst of the book was the cartoony artwork (one step above an Archie comic) and the avoidance of any depth of exploration of charcter. This was a wonderful opportunity to explore Batman's history of loss, his sense of individual responsibility balanced with protection of those he is close to, whether he can acheive attachments and whether he is an obsesssive zealot wrapped in the violent violet cloak of vengence or a man trying to work through his own past and issues of loss. Instead, Death in the Family was a crude, poor constructed, poorly coordinated piece of opportunistic garbage from the post-Reagan era. The 800 number says it all. If I were Denny O'Neill I would sanitize my name from this project and make no mention of this book, as though it were a bad joke or an off-color comment made when you thought no one was listening. Pure drivel. Only for the most obsessive collector (like myself)."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"So many other great Batman stories were written around this time -- Alan Moore's Killing Joke, Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum. This is not one of them."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"I still remember this was big news when it first came out and I still remembered the title it was called A Death in the Family. As a long time mostly cloested comic fan- out of fear of being labeled a geek, etc, I thought it was in poor taste not only to kill Robin who had been so much a part of the Batman mythos over the years as much as Batman himself, but to make The Joker from here on look like the biggest legitimate psychopath to ever grace the pages of any comic. I still remember the Batman TV show, the movies, the cartoon, and The Joker was a wise cracking villain, who- though he may give the impression he wants to kill batman, was not some super big psychopath. Anyhow, another similar story followed this years later- The Knightfall saga, telling the story of how Batman finally meets his match in a new super villain named Bane, who doesn't kill Batman, but breaks his back. The Death in the Family and Knightfall saga are some of the only interesting aspects to an otherwise mediocre Batman mythos in pop culture and urban legends. If DC comics was looking to draw in more readers and make a little extra money by killing some its most famous characters, here's one guy who got suckered out of some money. It is too gimmicky of a marketing approach, too much a silly and geeky guilty pleasure that you can't help but be aware of Batman in pop culture that it was too tempting to resist. Comics are my guilty pleasure I guess."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Apart from quite a poor plot and weak story which, as most of the other readers commented, has the sole purpose of getting rid of Jason, the writers obviously have never been to Lebanon. Maybe they would like to know that Batman has a lot of fans there and all this story did was alienate them because of its prejudice and racism! Can't you stick to fictitous places and keep politics out of it guys?"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"You've got to love DC. Every few years they decide to make national headlines by killing off a major character and boost sales. Now of course, DC NEVER wanted people to know that the Robin that was killed was NOT the original Dick Grayson character but rather the second Robin Jason Todd (who?) and what's more they left his fate up to a vote by fans via a 900 number. That shows you hoe popular Jason Todd was.DC got what they wanted. I was working part-time in a comic store and I remember vividly the all-out frenzy there was over the original issues. We limited one per customer and I never saw so many parents in the store to buy that ONE issue as moms and dads took separate places in line to get this \\"collectible\\".The Story was written by Jim Starlin who is an excellent writer but seems so much better with the more cosmic storylines people know him so well for rather than a gritty Batman story. Jim Aparo's art, while capable really is old style 1970's all the way. Aparo was an excellent artist in the 1970's but simply could not compete with guys like McFarlane and others in the 80's.Jason gets mixed up with the Joker who is granted citizenship by Iraq! later gets beaten by the Joker with a crowbar and then blown up. Well of course it would be not long before Batman would take Tim Drake as the third Robin and Jason would become a mere footnote. Bet DC never alerted the press to that little tidbit of information."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This book is an awful excuse for comic book writing. In it we find the second Robin, Jason Todd, in a search for his biological mother. He goes off to other countries to search for three possibilities. And both Batman and the Joker end up there for different reasons.After going through the first two women, Robin and Batman find his real mother. Then Batman goes off for a little while and Joker shows up and kills Robin and his mother.The lowest point in this is when Joker becomes the ambassedor of Iran. Which means Batman can't touch him. Superman tries to keep him in line.Truly bad, though it gets a star for the emotion showed by Batman, this should be skipped by comic fans."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"First, I want to state no graphic novel is going to get five stars from me. As much as I enjoy Batman, to give any of them five stars would be a stretch. After all, how many are on par with Twain, Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, ect.So, with that said, I have to state this is even poor for a graphic novel. The plot line is weak. The story itself is weak. If not for the killing of a key member in the Batman family, this would be unreadable.In other words, read it for the time line within the Batman realm, but do not think that you are getting a great story."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"It's been a while since the publication of this comic.

So this story, being the worst Batman story ever, doesn't stand a chance. Robin was voted dead by Batman readers, and they pinned it on the Joker. If Batman ever finds out he's going to beat his readers down. You have been warned.Also Jim Starlin is the 14th worst mainstream comicbook writer of all time.

I was reading Batman back in the day; I boughtBatman: The Killing Jokewhen it originally came out, for instance. But I might have shifted to Marvel Mutants by then. Or I might have disliked the hype, with the 900 number and all. Who knows? I just kind of figured I had read it at some point.Anyway, I thought it was a pretty solid story. It's a bit contrived, of course, but I like Bruce's dilemna about how to deal with Jason to keep him safe, etc. Joker is very calm and calculating, and the idea that he's desperate to raise some cash after being incarcerated is believable. I like that the government sends Clark to go warn Bruce away from attacking Joker at the UN. After they argue, Clark says, \\"I always feel like he knows more than I do.\\" I was surprised to realize that this story takes place not long after Killing Joke, as they refer to Babs' shooting on a number of occasions. That's quite a brutal period for the Joker."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This is the most emotionally resonant Batman book I have ever read. I really felt Batman's pain as he dealt with another close death in his life. The Death in the Family story also contains other cool things like Joker joining the Iranians and trying to kill the U.N. with his laughing gas....Superman makes an appearance in the book too. I can't really say anything bad about this story except there are a few parts where it is just a MAJOR coincidence that Batman finds Robin in Beruit. Really? And then the Joker just happens to be in Ethiopia and is dealing with the person that Batman and Robin have come to Ethiopia to find. Okay, I admit that these coincidences are almost ridiculous...but I didn't let these minor problems with the story take away from one of the most well written Batman stories I have ever read. On top of Death in Family being so good, this hardcover version also comes with \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\". I have not read the story yet, but my understanding is that it is the introduction of the new Robin, Tim Drake....it's just icing on the cake at this point...Highly Recommeded!!!!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"This is a classic arc and essential in understanding Batman's mind state during the modern age of comics. The death of Jason Todd was the second big tragedy in the life of Batman and he has since considered it quite possibly his greatest failure. Todd was a troubled kid, he acted on pure emotion and he didn't listen. He was nothing like Dick Grayson and no where near as likeable as Tim Drake. Here we also see the Joker at his most evil and cruel. This story is great, dark, and emotional. Because it is reflected on and flash-backed often in many of the major Batman stories since, it is very important to be familiar with this. This is the story where the Joker hit Batman the hardest. On a personal note, this was the first Batman TPB that I ever purchased when I was a kid back in the very early 90s. 1989's Batman movie made me a Bat-fan, this book made me a Comic-Bat-fanatic."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"With the revival of Jason Todd in \\"Under the Hood\\" many have wondered if that cheapens the impact his death has. As Bats himself said, \\"This doesn't change anything\\"This hardcover collection contains both \\"Death in the Family\\" itself and the followup storyline \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\"The first story reminds me in some ways of \\"The Killing Joke\\" in the way it feels so clearly as a product of the the zeitgeist of the late 80's while simultaneously feeling fresh. It is realistic in a grim way, while strangely feeling like a logical installment in the same series that has been running all those years. It contains a lot of content concerning the ugliness of human life, and strangely putting Batman and the Joker in the middle of it only highlights the horror of it all, instead of rendering it absurd.The second story is an interesting one, feeling more comfortably in the DC Universe with the Teen Titans mulling about and Two Face on the Rampage. It introduces Tim Drake as an absolutely earnest, intelligent nice character, who the Batman comics were lucky to get.Overall these are not grand artistic stories, but they are good stories worth reading as a comics fan, if only to show that not all of the grittiness that followed in the wake of Watchmen and DKR was bad."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"It's hard to imagine anyone who reads comics who hasn't read Batman: A Death in the Family, but if you haven't, you should. It's not that this is the best Batman tale ever, in fact plot seems a little far-fetched even for Batman. But the emotions dripping from the pages are raw and real and the death scene is worth the price of admission. And it should be noted that the price of admission is only around $5. You can't pass that up."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Okay,when DC was planning this storyline they knew they were treading into new territory.It would be a controversial time in the comics industry where the companies wanted to get more mature with their readers.DC lead a campaign in whicn the fans would vote to either kill Robin(Jason Todd,Dick Grayson's predecessor)or to let him live at the end of the story.Long story short,the Joker ends up beating Jason within an inch of his life with a crowbar.Batman was elsewhere at this time.Jason discovered that his mother was alive but under the Joker's fearful leadership.They met briefly before they were locked in a shipping crate.Jason was laying on the floor bleeding to death when the Joker placed a bomb with a timer in the crate.The Joker preceded to beat Jason's mom up pretty bad too.Just before the bomb went off,Jason shielded her from the blast.Jason died in her arms.Batman found the two,then Jason's mom dies and the last image you see is Batman carrying Robin's lifeless body away from the scene.It was a very gritty story for it's time but it was necessary for DC to evolve into the '90's.A new or old Batman reader or fan should own this story.Not only is it gripping, but it's comic book history just like the Death Of Superman and Knightfall.Excellent DC Comics read!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Here we are again lucky enough to have the fantastic talents of Jim Aparo drawing Batman. Yet another DC comics publicity stunt in part, though, as the latest incarnation of the Robin character was not too popular with readers. So, they decided to do a storyline where the Joker captures him, and the readers could vote on whether he died or not.Pretty clearly from the title, it is thumbs down for the Bird Boy."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"There are so many Batman comics out there nowadays that sometimes it's hard to pick out the good ones in the overflow that is offered. Let me be of a little help here and say that THIS one is one of those books you WANT to pick up. Why is it that nice ? Well, it's a story in which everybody (by now) knows what is gonna happen, still it takes you by surprise WHEN it actually happens and it is never boring or predictable. You don't see it coming. But &quot;the big event&quot; is certainly not the only reason why this story is good. It's also a very well written story where you get to know more about Jason Todd and what follows after Jason himself gets to know things he didn't know before.

Certainly one of the better Batman TPB's to pick up."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"The Joker killed Robin...maybe not Robin I,who was too old to be a Boy Wonder-but Robin II,who was too headstrong to be a truly efeective Boy Wonder. I wouldn't have had it done that way-but the genuine death of a lead character(so rare in comic books)adds more realism to the world of super heroes."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"It has been said that there are three milestones in the modern age of Batman:1.The death of Thomas and Martha Wayne.2.The alliance of Batman with the newly christened Robin, Dick Grayson.3.The death of Robin II, Jason Todd.Chip Kidd mentions in his book \\"Batman Collected\\" that the name Todd echoes in the German word \\"Tod\\" which means death. It is no irony that Jason Todd represents loss and tragedy in the DC universe and he is remembered as a boy who fought in a man's war against crime.While many of the tragedies of Bat-lore are based on villains' origins, the impact of this story is heavily weighed upon a not-so-righteous Robin. Fan never bonded much with Jason, a hotheaded youth who grew up fending for himself on the streets of Gotham. His nature vs. nurture instinct left him with little sympathy for criminals. (He once pushed a rapist off a roof to his death.) This is not to say that all streetwise parentless children are juvenile delinquents but in the case of Jason Todd, Batman was unable to successfully channel his inner rage into the more positive goal of Robin.\\"Death in the Family\\" unfolds as Jason goes off to Ethiopia in search of his long-lost mother. Bruce follows him and the two are caught up in a deadly battle of terrorists, betrayal, and the Joker. Despite Bruce's warnings, Jason's desire for truth blinds him from practical self-defense and he is lured into a trap before being beaten half to death by the Joker. Batman rushes to save him but it's too late and the Boy Wonder is finally annihilated in an exploding warehouse. The scene of a defeated Batman clutching Jason's bloodied body covered in tattered red and green rags is one of the most powerful iconic moments in all of DC's stories.The Joker's influence in Iran is a bit far fetched and has annoyed fans for its almost ridiculous stereotypes, but it only serves to channel the story along. After Batman returns to Gotham and buries Jason's body he discovers that his archenemy is rising up in the ranks of foreign alliance. Superman has to intervene to prevent Batman from bringing the wrong vengeance down for Jason's death.What made \\"Death in the Family\\" so powerful and a controversial best seller?Answer: The fans.DC allowed readers to call in by phone for two days to vote on Jason's outcome of the story: live or die. By a narrow margin in the ratings of fellow fans around the country, he was given thumbs down. I have heard in the world of the media, \\"There is no such thing as bad publicity\\". Hate mail did rain down on DC comics for doing this but the scenario just a small taste of how much of an influence the readers truly have on the outcome of a story.The story telling is adequate but what makes \\"Death in the Family\\" so influential is its titanic tragedy. Robin has been a part of the Bat-mythos since 1940 and his relationship with Batman has always not only been that of a mentor and a student, but as a father and a son.This book IS controversial but I believe DC knew they were taking a risk from the start. Those that read this story should be getting more out of it than a thrill or being disappointed if they don't like it. \\"Death in the Family\\" is a powerful reminder of the larger plan that works in the graphic novel market of a modern age audience. This story is one of the darkest of all dark stories, which says much for a serious hero like Batman whose origins are rooted in the death of his parents. The death of a surrogate son remains a stirring memorial in the Bat Cave where Jason's uniform hangs in a crystal case. The inscription reads, \\"In memory of Jason Todd. A good soldier.\\"If the story leaves you feeling downtrodden and depressed, I recommend reading \\"A Hero Reborn\\" next as an uplifting tale of how the mantle of Robin found worthy hands in Tim Drake, the third Boy Wonder and the current one to date. For another brooding but even more bewildering and thrilling story, \\"Under the Hood\\" is a recent work of fiction by Jud Winick. It brings about a question that has haunted Batman for over 16 years now: \\"What if Jason was never meant to die?\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"All of the other reviews do a good job of telling you about the story, so I won't rehash that here.

It sent Batman down a path even more guilt-ridden than his previous one and eventually led to the creation of a real balancing force in Tim Drake, the current (and best) Robin. Although the gimmick of allowing readers to call in and vote for letting Jason Todd live or killing him off seems sort of callow, it did gain this story serious attention, attention that it deserved. However (and perhaps this is the DVD fan in me) I feel sort of a pang of guilt that we've never seen the alternate ending for this story, the one where Jason survived. DC had both endings ready to go to the printer, just waiting for the response to come in... is there any reason we couldn't have included that alternate chapter in this collection? Heck, even if they stuck an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; label on that chapter, it would be fine with me. Something to consider, DC, the next time this book goes to print."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"The book renders the tale in which the second Robin, Jason Todd, meets his end at the hands of a notorious villain. Understanding some of the current Batman storylines requires knowledge of this event.The death in the family that the title describes molds the Batman character into what he is today; extremely reluctant to work with partners and overprotective of the two family members he still has.Strangely, this event reminds me of why Batman is truly a hero. Only he must pay the price for his one-man war on crime; casualties are unacceptable. He is willing to sacrifice himself completely to the task of cleaning up and protecting Gotham, he is not arrogant or cruel enough to manipulate others to do his bidding, however. This is his burden, and no one elses'. I think it is more of necessity than choice that he does work with anyone else.This book also reminds me of one of the things that most angered me about DC in this era; I wish they had just retired the second Robin because of his recklessness. In fact, that is what Bruce considers before Todd's life is cut short. So perhaps that complaint is overblown, but this will always remain Bruce Wayne's and Batman's, darkest day. Keep that in mind when you decide whether or not to get this."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"Well, there certainly isn't anything blantantly WRONG with this story. In fact, the end of it is fairly spectacular. Its the set up that bothers me.While I find it interesting that Robin wants to find his mother, I don't see why 90% of the story needs to be about Iranian terrorists and not Robin. While we should be getting a last look into Robin's soul, we instead see a bunch of guys with cloths over their heads shooting at him. Joker's elaborate &quot;scheme&quot; seems pointless and stupid, even for the Joker. Worst of all his plan is waaay too convenient for the purposes of the story.But as I said, the ending was well done. By the end of the story I knew what fate I would have chosen for Robin (kill the twerp!) but it was still sad to see him go. So if you, like me, truly need to see the death of Robin, then go ahead and pick this up.

There is an introduction and epiloge, and as a final dish is the alternate end for \\"Death in the Family\\" were Jason Todd actually lives. well, to be fair that's not actually that big of a deal.

The story isn't too bad, but does contain a few plot holes which are overlooked by the very strong ending. For the most part the art is average, though there are a few scenes that stick in one's mind long after the book has been put down.The comic became one of the most famous Batman comics of all time for three reasons. One, readers decided the fate of story. Two, a major character was killed off; something that was quite rare in the DC universe up to that point. Finally, the death of Jason Todd effects Batman even to the present day; he has become haunted by his death almost as much as he has been haunted by the death of his parents.As a side note, this comic first appeared in the middle 1980's when tensions between the U.S. and Lebanon were still quite hostile (they still had some American hostages) and that tension forms the background of the comic."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"First, my quibbles: This is very much a post-Iran/Contra scandal novel, complete with a guest appearane of everyone's favourite arab fundamentalist leader, and stereotyped arabic revolutionaries galore. Carboard cut outs of characters lifted from the collective consciousness of the western world rarely make for affective drama. Another quibble: The story doesn't really take off until part four, when Jason finds his mother. Before then, the tale is episodic and poorly plotted, with little foreshadowing as to the upcoming danger. The inclusion of Lady Shiva seems a bit pointless. Pros: Jason's sudden and unexpected death is both sudden and brutally affective. Jason does not even recieve the expected &quot;dying words of friendship scene&quot; expected by most western readers. He is just dead. The Joker, too, and Batman's obsession with him is handled superbly...the moment when Joker stops and simply stares at the scowling Bruce Wayne is wonderfully suggestive...is the bond between these two so great that they can simply recognise one another...with or without the mask? Ultimately, it is an essential read purely for Jason's death, but is a descent and entertaining read in and of itself."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"So it's Wednesday and I hear someone calling at the door, I go to check it out and I realized it's the mailman with my first amazon order, it's kind of special because i'm from Chile and I have never done this before.So the first thing I do is to see if it was the right product. It was, then I started to carefully reading it and suddenly all the memories of reading this when I was a child on a lousy Spanish edition came back rushing to me. I simply love this story, and to have it on a edition this awesome and in English it's just plain great.For those of you who are still having doubts about buying it, you need to consider the following aspects:1) It has a red hardcover protected by a nice printed cover that's shown on the picture of this Item.2) It has the whole story, you can smell the 90's on this edition.3) And i'm from Chile, so if I got it here, you can get it anywhere.It's a must if you know anything about Batman, besides if you already have a \\"Killing Joke Hardcover Edition\\", like myself, having this new hardcover story realizing what important event happened to Batman after that, this is just your ITEM.Thx. Amazon."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family: All Four Collector's Issues in One Volume","review":"DC Comics used a cheap promotional tool - a fan poll - as a means to \\"determine\\" what should be done with the second Robin, Jason Todd.Turning a story line into a typical means for a radio station to give listeners \\"ownership\\" in shows yielded Todd paying the ultimate price for his brashness and bold steps into vigilantism, no matter the end results for Batman. The geopolitical angle with the Joker is silly, but the way the iconic villain meticulously sets a trap for Robin is brilliant, as it plays on the worst aspects of an ego that cannot be dismissed as youthful exuberance to do the right thing.The feelings of Bruce Wayne/Batman truly slice into the soul of someone who understands the slippery slope of allowing raw emotions to determine actions while in the line of duty. But was everything done by the Dark Knight to prevent the steps to death?Though this volume is not be a complete picture to the hype - that won't happen until the company releases the alternative finish for the vote - it is a compelling story that gave the (slim majority of) voters what they wanted....in a compelling story."},{"Title":"Buddhist and Western Psychology","review":"This book contains 14 academic essays (9 very good, 2 okay, 3 not so hot IMHO) covering Theravada, Japanese, Mahayana, & Vajrayana Buddhism that overly use foreign language, are affectatious, but are frequently interesting & enlightening. In the better ones, Johansson compares Freudian defense mechanisms & Pali Buddhist texts' \\"psychological states which must be eradicated if Nirvana is to be attained.\\" Elder provides an insightful psychological analysis of Buddha's life, \\"unless one develops the capacity to enjoy the sensual life-the wine, women, & song most appropriately enjoyed in one's youth-there will be no Buddhahood.\\" Miyuki provides a wonderful \\"psychodynamic understanding of the Buddha's experience of enlightenment in terms of the individuation process...or the innate urge of the Self to realize itself.\\" Kondo compares Karen Horney's ideas vs. Buddhism's.

DeMartino excellently analyzes the Zen koan process. Kaplan analyzes/compares Yogacara Buddhism & Holographic Psychology, \\"Our perceptual images are like holographic images\\" explaining why objects appear to be outside & at a distance-similar to Buddhist views.

I've already got a few favorite pages that I come back to again and again.What struck me right off the bat was that this book wasn't code-heavy, but had much more in the way of explanations than most books, which was exactly what I have been seeking for a long time now. Then, as I got into it, I realized this book was changing my whole way of thinking about coding with Flash Actionscript, and it's because of their heavy stress on \\"modular\\" coding techniques. The authors call it \\"black box\\" programming and making \\"building blocks\\" of code. It's really encapsulation. Whatever you want to call it, they back it up with solid examples. The demonstration of the apply() method on pages 360 and 361 was alone worth the price of the book!On pages 308 and 309, there's an example of making a movie clip containing video controls that you can just drag and drop into any movie, and bingo! you've got a set of controls for that movie (play, stop, pause, fastforward, rewind). Again, the idea is that if you build something once, you should be able to reuse it, with minor tweaking here and there.Chapter 10, Games & Sprites, is really cool! There's a fully functioning \\"zapper\\" arcade-type video game with a complete explanation of the rationale behind how something like that is designed and coded, and what variables should be global, which ones belong on _root, and which should stay local to each object (All of the examples in the book can be downloaded from the publisher's website, BTW. In fact, you can download the examples even if you haven't yet bought the book).Although a lot of the stuff in the earlier chapters is very basic, taking you through stuff like variables, arrays, loops, conditionals, etc, the stress on modularity is woven throughout. The main idea that you come away with (certainly the central idea of the book) is that it's worth the time it takes to design and plan something modularly. Even though at first it does take longer, in the end you wind up with something that's WAY easier to modify.Now, I say all that from my own perspective, and I'm probably an intermediate level programmer. So maybe the stuff I'm saying about this book and it's stress on modularity would be old hat to a pro. I don't know. Then again, I've got about 8 books on Actionscript, each one having stuff unique to itself, and this one has things in it that just aren't to be found in the others.All through the book, there's also an ongoing project for building a modular Flash website. I haven't gotten into working along with that yet, but I'm sure I will eventually (I've had the book about a month). In any case, they add a little more to the project at the end of each chapter, so that it progresses into more advanced stuff at about the same pace as the rest of the book.There's a basic introduction to classes and oop in the last chapter. It should be understood that it's not extensive, and that's not the focus of this book anyway. It does tie in with the stress on modularity, and there's good explanations of when and how you might use classes in your programming. But if want material specifically about classes, there are other books that make that their focus.To sum up: I would recommend this book for beginner to intermediate programmers. Although much of the stuff in the earlier chapters will probably be a rehash of what you already know, the stress on modularity is there from the beginning, and there is good material throughout. If you've heard about modular code and code reuse, but never really seen good examples of it, open this book to some of the pages I mentioned above (308, 356, 360, 361, 364) and see if any of it registers an \\"aha\\" moment. Also, if you're looking for a bit less code and lot more explanation about techniques, get this book.I also recommend \\"Foundation Actionscript Animation: Making Things Move\\" by Keith Peters, from the same publisher."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"I am a current animation student in California and Flash is one of the tools we are using. While I have developed some proficiency animating in Flash, the scripting tends to turn my brain to mush after a while.I picked up Foundation Flash 8 to learn some of the basics and have been using Foundation Actionscript for Flash 8 to gradually explore scripting. I am not a programmer but got through the first few chapters easy enough. The second half of the book is somewhat tougher but but filled with interesting chapters -especially the game chapter (chapter 10).I haven't quite cleared the hurdle of the later chapters, find them more challenging, but I keep the book on my desk to pick at stuff. It is well written and comprehensive. From my perspective as a non-programming 'art head' I'd say it covers beginner to advanced level topics by the end of the book; that's pretty cool because many books seem to be simple rehashings of the product manuals designed to part you from $40-$50 while giving you no new info."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"As an old UNIX hack I have read quite a few programming manuals, from the original C (Kerninghan & Richie - when it was new!), to the present. Very few, if any, (including the O'Reilly series), have come close to being so informative, easy to read, and enjoyable as the 'ActionScript for Flash 8' book. I consider myself a poor programmer partly because I never found 'print Hello World!' that interesting. In any event, this book has taken me from rank Actionscript beginner to (dare I say it...) semi-advanced! Basically, cannot recommend it highly enough! For me, I enjoy the graphical nature of Actionscript and I am glad I finally found the right book to take me there. I think beginners and experienced Object-Oriented types will get a lot or something from it.

I had previously read one book on understanding the basic flash interface (i.e. using the drawing/tweening tools), but this was my first crack at ActionScript. Getting through this book was very easy. Each chapter is setup in a way that explains a specific topic, runs you through a few examples using what you just learned, and then continues on with an ongoing website project that you develop throughout the book.Strengths: Writing is clear and concise, and doesn't feel like a programmer wrote the book. The context is a nice mix of theory and hands on practice to keep you interested while your learning some of the more complex topics. The teaching method looks to provide you with skills that you can apply and expand upon quickly, as opposed to just learning some commands and then throwing you out into the wild. The book projects are very well constructed and explained.Weaknesses: Some of the later chapters advance quickly. I blew through the first 350 pages, but after that had to significantly slow down to fully understand each topic. I also noticed that one or two of the online downloads are missing files for the book project. These are not neccesary if you are writing everything from scratch (correctly), but it did sometimes get in the way of comparing my solutions to the books.Overall I have been extremely satisfied with this book, and will most likely buy another Foundation guide."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"I am not too far into this book, but so far it is everything i had hoped for.

Primarily centered around web-based projects, with the occasional game project, Sham et al. lead the reader through basic programming fundamentals from a designer perspective. The reader is assumed to be mildly frightened by looking at code, but still interested in learing it. I can sympathize that many designers could be in this boat.The language of the book is very non-technical and it's presented in a light-hearted manner to ease you into some difficult concepts. The authors do a great job of tricking you into getting excited about programming. So if you're a web designer who has always been impressed by what programmers can do, but were a little uncomfortable trying to just jump in on your own, this is THE book for you.I have two warnings and one critique.The first warning is that this is a Flash 8 book - hence ActionScript 2.0. The second warning is that almost all the projects in the book are web-based instead of game-based. Now it's Flash, so it kind of comes with the territory, and there is a full chapter devoted to making a game. However, the perfect book for me would be this exact same book, but centered almost completely around game-based projects. If you're strictly looking for that, this book isn't for you. I don't care as much, and there's still a lot to learn, so I don't regret purchasing the book.My critique is regarding the book-long project where you make a website that uses ActionScript (the Futuremedia site). It's a case study where you can apply some of what you've learned to a \\"real\\" project. My problem with it is that you don't seem to learn a whole lot about ActionScripting by going through it. The authors (or whichever individual wrote the project) seem to be really proud of this project - proud in the sense that they like themselves for it - and you can tell by going throug it. Plus, its more content-oriented. There's much more to learn from everything else, so I'm just skipping the project and skimming over it whenever it's time to work on it a little (which isn't a whole lot anyway).Overall, it's a great book so far (I'm about 1/3 done) and I'd recommend it to anyone who's new to programming and wants to learn it through ActionScript 2.0. Sham has an awesome ability to explain programming to a designer."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"I love Actionscript, but I always have trouble understanding it for some reason.

There are great hints and tips scattered throughout the pages, but not mentioned in the index. If you don't take note of where those tips are, you'll have a hard time finding them when you need them.Overall, I definitely recommend this book to intermediate AS2 programmers."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"Helpful book. ActionScript 2.0 is a very well-structured language, and this book gives it justice by thoroughly explaining the structure. If, like me, you're coming from creative background but are new to programming, be prepared to have your brain work at the edge of its processing capacity, but it's worth it. At times I found my mind fogged with the amount of new information introduced in each new chapter, but just when I felt I've missed something a few pages ago, that very thing was explained and reinforced."},{"Title":"Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8","review":"This book cover many of very important topics and approaches and therefore 4 stars but sometime specially after 4th chapter is hard to follow even for the intermediate level of Action Script knowledge."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Hamlet (The student's Shakespeare)","review":"This really is \\"The Tragical History of Hamlet Prince of Denmark\\" and not only the Prince but also his family. Not only his family but his friends. The tragedy started in the previous generation. Will it end with Hamlet?Many people are interested in dissecting underlying themes and read more into the characters actions than was probably intended. Many of phrases from Hamlet now challenge Bible for those popular quotes that no one remembers where they came from. The real fun is in just reading the story and as you find that it is not as foreign as you may have thought; you see many characters like these around you today.A synopsis, Old Hamlet conquered Old Fortinbras seizing Fortinbras' land. Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Prince Hamlet who is excessively grieving the loss of his father, the king, gets an interesting insight from his father's ghost. Looks like Old Hamlet was a victim of a \\"murder most foul\\"; it appears his mother and uncle were in cahoots on the murder. On top of that they even get married before the funeral meats are cold.The story is about Hamlet's vacillating as to what to do about his father's murder. However he does surprise many with his persistence and insight.You will find many great movie presentations and imitations of the story; this is an intriguing read but was really meant to be watched.William Shakespeare's Hamlet (Two-Disc Special Edition)"},{"Title":"The tragedy of Hamlet (The student's Shakespeare)","review":"first of all... forget the movie versions...if you really want to experience this great work theres only one thing to do .....read the book ! prince hamlet is a tragic character who is trying to get revenge for the death of his father...well you know the rest of the story so i wont go into it... its a gripping and tragic story with a lot of substance..this edition of the literary classic is top notch and is worth picking up..granted its NOT an easy read at first ..because you have to take your time to really get into the story..but once you do..youll discover what a excellent story hamlet truly is..i remember reading this in high school and in college ..and i was hooked right away on this.. still am.."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE.","review":"I have a number of books in the \\"Cultural Atlas\\" series and I have to say that this is one of the better ones.

It makes you smile all the way through because there's this sense of joy, rightness throughout every chapter. The basic storyline is that a single librarian (I can relate) and a halfbreed, stunningly handsome Indian unite in a convenient marriage to help him keep custody of his sister's kids. There could be some complaint that Wade's Cree heritage wasn't high-lighted enough, but, as a part-breed Choctaw, I can say that that is not uncommon in real life, especially for non-reservation (or no longer reservation) Indians. We tend to be pretty normal. I thought that aspect was realistic and sensitive.And the caring Clarissa and Wade both have for the kids is touching. The characters are, over all, well drawn and sympathetic. And there's pining! Isn't that the best part of a romance novel? It's not will they/won't they, it's when and how. Lois Richer did a wonderful job of pulling me in and making me feel on the verge--on the verge of Clarissa realizing her own feelings, of Wade accepting them, on the edge of a happy ending.

I didn't care for the last two chapters, it seemed as if someone totally different wrote chapter fourteen and the epilogue didn't add anything to the story.

Clarissa ignored his urging her to stay away from his two nieces and two nephews in was in the process of adopting - FAR AWAY! But those children needed her and besides, Wade's bark was definitely worse than his bite!But when a social worker threatens to take his four children away, Wade's mind does a 180. One day he's commanding the woman to stay away from him, and the next...well...he's asking her to MARRY him???This was an excellent and highly entertaining story. I did think Wade's change of heart was a bit abrupt, but given the circumstances, i can overlook it. The children are dears, Clarissa is sweet, and Wade is one heck of a man (even though he is a wound a bit too tight). And I LOVED the preacher! Oh, I do hope he has his own story - he certainly deserves it...Clarissa's longing to not be a burden to anyone ever again mixes with Wade's belief that he cannot love because he hurts anyone he loves. This causes a lot of conflict, but I never had doubts they would eventually fall madly in love and become a family. It was a Mother's Day miracle!

Back at the library, Clarissa prays for a husband and children to love. No sooner does the prayer leave her mouth than in strides the dashing Wade Featherhawk, looking for a book for his bird-loving &quot;son.&quot;Seeking to make a new start, Wade and his four rambunctious charges moved into town in Clarissa's absence. But that didn't stop the well-intentioned busybodies of their tiny Michigan town from matchmaking. Predictably, Wade wants no part in the process. But rather than clamming up or avoiding Clarissa once she introduces herself, he broadsides her with a verbal barrage designed to convince her he doesn't need a wife.Wade's behavior in the opening scene seemed so contrary to my understanding of the Male Animal that I bounced it off my live-in expert. He concurred. Most men in similar circumstances wouldn't behave this way no matter how much pent-up frustration and anger they harbor. Realizing that it sometimes takes an author a few scenes to hit stride with a character, I kept reading, hoping to see improvement. I never did. Clarissa's friends and her internal monologue paint Wade as &quot;the strong, silent type,&quot; but he never acts the part. Richer also fails to provide any description of his Cree heritage other than vague references to &quot;the reservation.&quot; Richer could've just as easily labeled him a Sioux or Cherokee, for all the difference it would have made to the story.Clarissa's portrayal doesn't fare much better. Aside from a nice scene where she &quot;stands by her man,&quot; her actions and reactions feel less like a real person's than a puppet's. Clarissa and Wade intrepidly cross the threshold of matrimony to prevent the town's Chief Busybody from filing a petition to put Wade's nieces and nephews into foster care. But the couple's subsequent attempts to heal their wounded pasts and make the marriage work never quite ring true. Usually, it takes years to develop the depth of mutual trust necessary for a strong marriage, but Wade and Clarissa accomplish this feat in mere weeks. Maybe that's the miracle, but I didn't find it too believable.I give Richer a point for her depiction of the children as unique and endearing individuals without having them steal the show, as sometimes happens with blended-family romances. Another point goes for technical skill in handling the characters' viewpoints, even though I didn't agree with their psychological makeup."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Euell Gibbons became a household word after the 60's because he did a famous cereal commercial &quot;Tastes like wild hickory nuts.&quot; Now most of us have never chewed on hickory nuts, but we were captivated by Euell's down-home charm. And during his heyday, we were getting back to nature, being hippies, reading the Foxfire books and re-acquainting ourselves with nature after the cosmic-rocket styles of the 50's.This book is fun to read because of Euell's way of writing as if he were walking beside you in a field, pointing out the bounties of nature to you personally. His praise of the humble cat-tail, seen in any marsh or even in highway medians is nothing short of a miracle. I think he could survive on cat-tails alone for weeks.Perhaps Euell felt so strongly about wild foods because as a teen during the Depression in the Texas dustbowl, he provided for the family during a particularly lean time, by gathering wild foods to supplement their diet of mostly pinto beans. He wandered many states later on in his life, finally settling in Camp Hill, PA with his wife Freda, but he never lost his love of wild foods and his feeling that, no one need be hungry if he is a friend of nature.This book is especially poignant if you have read Into the Wild by Krakauer, the account of a young man who strikes off into the wilds of Alaska to test his mettle, and perishes from a fatal mistake in botany. I recommend all of Euell Gibbon's books, but especially this one, as it was written straight from his heart.

He is equally authoritative on cooking as on gathering, giving clear steps on making everything from stuffed grape leaves to fried frog's legs to Elder Blow Fritters.But for me the real charm of Gibbons is his evocation of how we ate in the past; far, far in the past when all food was wild food. He speculates that mankind has probably eaten \\"many millions of tons more of acorns...than of the cereal grains\\". Fascinating, when you consider that no groceries now carry this formerly prevalent staple, as though it were as useless as an 8-track tape. Gibbons reminds that dandelions were prescribed by primitive doctors to ward off diseases caused by vitamin deficiency long before we had any concept of a vitamin. He is mindful, as he plucks wild grape leaves, that the Vikings reported the presence of grapes on our continent a thousand years ago, and thought that important enough to name it Vinland.His style is what one would expect from an amiable, erudite grandfather, a member of one of the last generations that saw starvation in America, and that knew the delight of tasting fresh spring greens after a long winter without vegetables. His type is often dismissed as corny and hopelessly outdated because they persist in old habits that have been rendered obsolete by refrigeration and truck farms. But his type pays no attention to such ridicule, focussing instead on the joys of hunting and gathering--not just for the meat and free vegetables, but also the pleasure of a \\"creative protest against the artificiality of our daily lives\\" or the pleasure of observing a \\"child's unspoiled sense of wonder\\" at \\"living, at least in part, as our more primitive forebears did\\". Reading ASPARAGUS is like watching such a child."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I was always interested in survival and eating wild foods and I tried several (with indifferent results) during my boy scout days. Thus, it was that \\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\" was a revelation to me when I first encountered it as a young man. Somebody else in the world was interested in eating wild plants! Quite a few somebodies, it developed, because this book ran through a lot of printings and Euell Gibbons became a folk hero and TV star.Gibbons identifies and discusses the culinary virtues of about 50 different wild plants and animals. Among the familiar plants he identifies are dandelions, cattails -- the \\"supermarket of the swamp\\" -- and daylilies. He tosses in a few animals worthy of pursuit and ingestion by the modern day hunter/gatherer: bluegills, turtles, frogs, and carp. One is immediately impressed that Gibbons knows what he is talking about. He tells you what you need to do with the plant or animal, gives you a recipe or two for its preparation, and adds a bit of personal experience and folklore about the plant. He even gives you menus for wild-food feasts.There is something of the primeval in the attraction of children to gathering their own food, even if is only raspberries growing beside a road. For a few, such as Gibbons, it becomes a lifelong passion. His strength as a writer is infectious enthusiasm. I usually find nature writers to be preachy and sanctimonious. Gibbons isn't. He seems impervious to the thought that he might be considered as crazy as a loon (not one of the animals he proposes for eating). He can say with a perfectly straight face, \\"Let's go nutting.\\"\\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\" has found a permanent place on my bookshelf and due recognition as a nature classic.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"This book ushered in a new era. Unlike most previous works by naturalists which simply inspired or informed, this one moved many to action -- inducing them to &quot;get back to nature&quot; in a very real and practical way. Not to conquer it, per the phony outdoorsmen works galore, nor to simply stand in awe of it, putting it on a pedestal as if it were some kind of prima donna (as do many of the phony environmentalists of today, most of whom have not so much as camped a single night in the woods). But, simply, TO BE ONE WITH NATURE!I believe this unique kind of motivation ensued because Gibbons spoke with a friend's voice, a companion's voice, and yet with the voice of authority. Indeed, you never doubted that he was the master of his field. In fact, his skill with the wilderness was something he had honed all his life, even back as a youngster when he once saved his family from starvation by bringing home a bushel basket of wild goodies from the woods.If only people would sit down and read what Gibbons said about the absolute necessity of preserving wild lands, and would really start to speak up and to do something about it, maybe the greedy land &quot;developers&quot; who have run so amok to the point of utter land rape can yet be stopped. (Imagine the mental gymnastics that one must have to go through to justify adopting such a shameful and cowardly profession as land developer!)Both this book by Gibbons and his many sequels bear testimony as well to the man's magnificent literary skills (he had set out to become a novelist, but his wife convinced him to effectuate the first rule of writing: &quot;Write about what you know.&quot;) It is a task that he performed well, writing with apparent ease and putting to mere paper the very secrets of his heart.Finally, Gibbons' works impress upon readers his love for his fellow man -- a love that may have eventually killed him, for he died in 1975 of a heart attack brought on, we are informed by his friends, by his overcommitment to inquirers, fans, and charitable organizations. (His inability to quit smoking well into his later years probably didn't help much either.)It is doubtful that people will forget Euell; from his witty banter with Johnny Carson on The Tonite Show, to his breakfast-cereal commercials, to the many spoofs of him that appeared on the Carol Burnett Show, his likeness and quaintness are sure to be perpetuated in people's minds. Let's just hope his message starts getting there, too!Treat the earth like the Indians did, he urged, utilizing the land's resources but being ever careful to respect them and to renew them; for once we leave off reverential interraction with the natural environment, we lose our appreciation of it. And that's our swan song for sure.It was Thoreau who said: &quot;In wildness is the preservation of the world.&quot; But it was Gibbons who brought that maxim to everyman, by exemplifying it"},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Overall rating: 3 starsPlant identification: 2 starsPlant uses: 4 starsPicture type(s): black & white drawingsWho will find it useful: experienced foragers who can already identify plants but want more ways to prepare, ferment, or smoke them. It is also a good inspiration for those just starting to forage.Notes: Euell Gibbons is considered the grandfather of modern foraging. While this book isn't much help in identifying wild edible plants it shines in how to prepare them for eating, drinking (tea, coffee, fermented), or smoking them. His prose reads almost like poetry and I can't read more than a few pages before he's inspired me to dash off into the woods to gather something for supper."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Euell Gibbons (1911-1975) had an adventurous life to say the least. His first intro to wild foods was due to his family's poverty when they lived in New Mexico. At 12 years old, Gibbons went out in the surrounding country-side to forage for edibles to help feed his family and a life-long love of wild food got off to a pragmatic start. One of his first discoveries was wild asparagus, hence the book title namesake.This book is lyrical, yet practical and covers a sizeable array of wild foods- location, preparation, uses, etc. Recipes are given all through the book as well as some medicinal use info. One of Gibbons' favorite plants was the Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). He relates how the Dandelion has been one of humanities longest known and useful wild foods and medicines and laments the assault by lawn care chemical manufacturers in trying to demonize this beautiful, helpful gift from Nature.Gibbons traveled the world lecturing on the benefits of wild foods and was often seen on popular talk shows along with becoming a pitch-man for Post Grape Nut Cereal commercials where he treated America to hilarious daily line: \\"...taste like wild hickory nuts!\\". Gibbon's came across like a modern-day cross between Mark Twain, Will Rogers and Henry David Thoreau.Those familiar with Thoreau's recently published last manuscript, \\"Wild Fruits\\" will see the close resemblance to \\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\"- both now classics and useful guides to Nature's cornucopia of wild edible gifts."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Of all of Gibbon's books that I read as a kid, I think this was his very best work. Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\\\Heathfull herbs, were the first two books that went into any suitcase or backpack, when I went anywere near nature. Nowadays, with all the herb books on the markets,with their bright glossy photo's, anyone can go find herbs in the wild. Gibbons books had line drawings at best. But his knack with storytelling, and his everpresent wit, did more to get me out in the wild than any picture today. And if you don't go, no picture in the world does anything for you. Euell Gibbons wrote with humor, and with a love of the out doors. You can't read his books and not think of the guy next door. When I come across one of his books, I smile when I read it. The fond memories are there, along with the wealth of herb lore I obtained. He had a wholsome approach, and a wealth of information to share."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Euell Gibbons was master forager, or at least among those that are also authors. His book is absolutely fascinating, and he makes the reader aware of a multitude of wild plants and animals that few have ever tasted, or even been aware of for that matter.There are countless useful recommendations for the preparation of foraged foods, many of which would be unpalatable or even inedible without using the provided suggestions. His stories are great and he relates many tales from his days as a forager.The problem I have with the book is that it is first and foremost a cookbook. It has drawings and descriptions of most, but not all, of the wild edibles he talks about. This is hardly a good method for identifying plants. On the back cover it even suggests you could live off the plants and animals described in the book. This is possible, but not likely, particularly if you cannot even properly identify the plants! And considering that there are numerous poisonous plants in any given locale, you had best not delve to deeply into the world of foraging without tagging along with an expert or at least having a detailed field guide.Take the book for what it is - an excellent resource for preparing wild edibles and opening a whole new world for the outdoorsman.Bret"},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I have known this book for over 20 years. I has been almost a bible for my foraging. I used to borrow it from the library several times a year. Then the county libraby removed it from the shelf to make room for newer books. I was very dissappointed. I had to borrow the book from a library 2 counties away. I was delighted to discover that Amazon carried Stalking the Wild Asparagus. The book is a wonderful reference tool, personable, acurate, and has detailed illustrations."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I find the contrived home-spun common sense and naivety of contemporary books to be irritating, but with Euell Gibbons as the narrator I'm taken back to a simpler era (which may exist only in the popular imagination, but which still has an impact on those of us who from time to time rush through life). Rather than a how-to guide for foraging, I read in this book a way of living which stresses that, to use an already overused but apt phrase, we all stop to smell the roses once in a while."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I bought this book as a teenager and still sit down with my ragged copy several times a year, always amazed at the new nuances I learn from it. Euell Gibbons was truly a master at what he did. He wrote from vast personal experience, without pretense, in a friendly tone that makes his readers love him. He was so folksy you can almost forget how extensive was the knowledge that he shared. But the more I forage, the more I come back to this book and marvel at the treasured paragraphs within.Euell didn't just share practical information about gathering plants and cooking them; he shared an infectious enthusiasm so powerful that it drew the half-interested into the fields and woods to try the things he praised. To anybody interested in edible wild plants, I recommend this book before all others. It only covers a rather small number of plants, but it is a good selection--and you can't cover them all in one book.While I do believe that Euell at one point confused common dogbane with common milkweed shoots, and therefore gave an alarmist and inaccurate description of milkweed's bitterness, this is still among the most accurate and reliable wild food books out there.There are many plant identification books in existence; this is not one of them. Some people seem unable to comprehend that there is other information to learn about plants besides their names, and therefore think that all wild food books must be identification guides or they are useless (see moronic review above). Well, if you are too impatient or lazy to own more than one book, you aren't going to get anywhere with edible wild plants anyway. But if you're wondering what to do with a plant once you've identified it, this is the book."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"After using Euell's treatise for a few years, you'll not only have a great appreciation for the vast stores of food we so often overlook; you'll look to Euell as if he were a close friend.---- Alexander Pasmur"},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Whether you'd ever eat cattails, tap maple trees, or bring home 'possum for dinner, Euell Gibbons will change how you see a lawn, roadside, or forest -- forever."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"Not only is this book full of recipes for wild plant dishes, but it includes wild animals as well. I like his attitude towards the things that many people won't touch - I mean this dude ate a bobcat and had a buddy there eating it with him. Where do you find these kind of people? I don't know anyone who would eat bobcat unless money was involved."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers (Joanna Daneman, Timothy Ritter, Small Chief & Bret Hall) that explain who Gibbons was and how the book became what it is today. I will elaborate more on the actual contents of the book. Each plant entry gives the common and scientific name, some lore & history, a general description of the plant accompanied by very raw sketches, general habitat and range, flowering and gathering times, recipes, medicinal uses (if aplicable) and will usually have entertaining stories associated with the plant from Euell's past experiences. Keep in mind this information is found in various places in the text so I find it helpful to underline/highlight the important information to me so when I go back to reference it I can find it easily. This is not a field guide as one reviewer said and should not be relied on to go to your local abandoned lot to find and identify edible plants. With all of the edible plant guides out there with color plates and easier formats to use I suggest you'll need a supplement to this book if you are an amateur botanist. Otherwise, this book is highly recommended to anyone that has an interest in wild edibles."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"The late Euel Gibbons was an iconic figure whose three books, \\"Stalking The Wild Asparagus\\"; \\"Stalking The Healthful Herbs\\"; and \\"Stalking The Blue-eyed Scallop\\" have been brought back into print for a new generation of appreciative readers by Alan C. Hood & Company. All three of these foraging 'how to' manuals are especially noted as being thoroughly 'user friendly' and packed with a wealth of practical information. These compendiums of information are nicely illustrated with line drawings. All three of these informed and informative titles are still considered to be a seminal trilogy and strongly recommended for anyone seeking to harvest and utilize the natural resources that grow wild in fields, forests, swamps, along the roadsides and in vacant lots -- and free for the taking by those who know where to look -- and when. Although available separately, community library systems in particular would be well advised to acquire all three titles for their collections."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"This book is not exactly what I was expecting. Which is kind of unfair on my part since it is exactly what it claimed to be, it was just nothing more. WHAT IT IS LACKING: good pictures of the plants, info on what areas of the country plants grow in, and DETAILED info on how to find them. If you are looking for a quick synopsis of how to find wild vegetation with a long winded personal story from the author then this is a perfect book for you. I, personally, wish I would have just looked up the few wild plants I was looking for online. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice book...just really not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I can't describe how much I enjoyed reading this book. It's worth reading just for the tone of the author and his love of the subject, even if you never intend to follow in his footsteps. But, over and above that, this is a real, serious guide to foraging. If that's where you're headed, this book will get you there. Before reading, I was only slightly interested in wild edibles. After, I was inspired to know much more about the natural world.Pros: Extensive, detailed, complete treatment of each plant described, including identification, harvest and then preparation (often including recipes). The anecdotes of the author, describing the development of his love for foraging, are inspiring and encouraging.Cons: No photographs. And this is a real bummer. There are illustrations, but I really wanted color photos. This is almost certainly a product of the times (this book isn't exactly new) and keeps costs down, but I miss the photos present in more modern foraging books."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Asparagus","review":"I had to get another copy of this classic title.

And, while the progression is, also as always, cliche and stereotypical, he still manages to sneak a few goodies in that can make a reader see past the shallow fun of the festivities to the big picture Akamatsu's trying to paint adventure-wise for the entire title.All in all, a fun read with more than a few possible red herrings/hints to the grand arc and jokes (nun's who are witches?)."},{"Title":"Negima!: Magister Negi Magi, Vol. 9","review":"Usually the chapters after an epic battle are a letdown. But Ken Akamatsu keeps up the pace in the ninth volume of \\"Negima,\\" via a bunch of character-development stories that explore Negi's class even further. Thought a vampire, a robot, a ninja and two half-demon kids were weird? It only gets better here.The entire school is preparing for the massive Mahora Festival, and 3-A isn't sure what their \\"theme\\" will be. And Negi is still depressed, believing himself to be weak and a bad teacher. Who will rescue him? Satsuki Yotsuba, a kindly gourmet with a knack for helping others -- both with food, and with her common sense.Negi also gets to know other girls in his class -- the girls go a-ghostbusting when the timid class ghost tries to get friendly; robot girl Chachamaru suddenly gets klutzy and stuttery, prompting mad scientist Hakase to run a diagnostic. The results are unexpected -- Chachamaru is experiencing human emotions, and has fallen in love.And while Asuna has had a crush on her hunky ex-teacher for awhile, she's never worked up the nerve to admit it. Eager to help her, Negi tries a magic pill that temporarily ages him four or five years. He's quite the hottie, and Asuna finds herself disconcerted by this handsome teenager. And when the Dean reveals some stunning new facts about the World Tree, Negi finds himself having to defend one of his students -- from other wizards!When \\"Negima\\" started, it seemed like a rather limp cross between Harry Potter and \\"Love Hina.\\" But as the ninth volume rolls around, it's clearer than ever that Ken Akamatsu has grown into his series' large shoes. He's better than ever at mixing fantasy, comedy and lovable characters.Peripherally, it's all about the upcoming Festival (which apparently will happen in the tenth volume). But the real focus is on the wizard boy and his students, and Akamatsu doesn't resort to stereotypes to make them likable (especially chubby Yotsuba). And fans of rough dog-boy Kotaro will be glad to see that he's apparently joined the cast full time, as Negi's rival/foil/friend.There's plenty of straightforward comedy, like various kids having fun with the aging pills, and the disastrous date that Asuna and Negi go on. And while most of the story focuses on the various girls in Negi's class, it ends with a sorcerous scuffle with Negi, Kotaro and Setsuna, promising a great time in the next volume.Ken Akamatsu's \\"Negima\\" series is still going strong in the ninth volume, and things only promise to get better. A solid collection."},{"Title":"Negima!: Magister Negi Magi, Vol. 9","review":"You'd expect Negi to be a bit worn out after fighting Graf Wilhelm back in the end of volume 8, but no. He's back and going full-speed again. This time, however, his challenges involve his class- and are much more hilarious than his previous situations. Volume 9 begins the MahoraFest saga, a story arc that spans six volumes before finally ending in volume 14. So this is just the beginning, and it already promises to be quite the thrill ride.As Negi arrives at school, he is greeted by a surprise visitor: Kotaro, who apparently transferred to Mahora after Negi's fight with the Graf. It's also revealed that Kotaro is still staying with Chizuru and Natsumi, even though Kotaro says he's trying to get his own place. Kotaro's very impressed with Mahora's size, and both he and Negi are awed by the giant gate proclaiming \\"MahoraFest!! Only 15 Days Left!!!\\" (or something like that; I don't have the manga right in front of me...). Negi gets told about MahoraFest, and gets quite the surprise when he walks into his classroom to find Ayaka, Sakurako, and one other person all dressed in maid costumes!!! It's now up to Negi and the class to come up with an idea for their MahoraFest booth, but the class's ideas are less than... kid-friendly, let's say (especially Fumika's \\"cat-eared nudie bar\\" idea). They finally settle on doing a haunted house, and the classmates get right to work.That's not all the action that goes on, though. Chachamaru's been acting quite strange lately, so Hakase asks her to come in for a tune-up... and Chachamaru's followed to Hakase's lab by Konoka, Asuna, Setsuna, and Negi!!! There, Hakase (with Konoka's help) makes a startling discovery- Chachamaru's in love!!! Hakase then puts Chachamaru through a series of... interesting tests to see who she's in love with, but to everyone's surprise, it turns out to be... okay, now that's too much of a plot spoiler, so I'm not gonna tell you. Then there's that little part about Negi having to defend one of his own students (who is also a mage) against a group of wizards who want to take her hostage!!!Having read the entire series well before I started reviewing them, I can say that the start-up hilarity of volume 9 is well-matched by the proceeding volumes.

Matter of factly says that de-cementing can be fixed by lens technicians by cleaning and re-gluing but in my experience they sure don't want to do it and if you can talk them into it they want an incredible price so why is this problem not noted by the book?

In a very real way, I find that I am living with my dead friends.&quot; At first she is saddened by how many good friends have passed on, yet soon she realizes that the friendships remain alive in her, her memories, and in books and articles that they wrote or enjoyed together.This awareness grows as she plans her own 80th birthday, an event that she would normally have not looked forward to. Instead, she makes a lot of new beginnings. She trades in her old car for a year-old Toyota. She takes on a kitten as a pet. She shops for new clothes for the party. She has the yard redone for the party. She returns to a long abandoned manuscript for a novel. And she frets a lot about getting ready for the party.While all this is going on, she rereads her favorite books, examines what others have said about turning 80, and reminisces. That's when she begins to enjoy herself with her wonderful friends of the past.Few of us have reached 80, yet most of us have met someone who has. Like all milestones, it offers a chance to reflect. These wonderful thoughts, so beautifully expressed, are a gift to us all that we can begin to enjoy -- even though we may be younger or older than 80.I remember giving my Father a bottle of port that was very old for his 80th birthday, and asking him questions about what happens to port with age. He kept answering that it gets better, and that insight helped him to many new beginnings in his 80s.I often encourage people to adopt a ageless perspective on their lives. Enjoy the optimism of youth, tempered by the experience of maturity, extended by the connections of age, and expanded by the time to explore regardless of your current chronological age. This book is written in a way that is very consistent with that stallbusting mindset.Regardless of your age, you can learn valuable life lessons from The Pleasure of Their Company.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of their Company","review":"As Grumbach is planning her 80th birthday party, she reflects on friends both living and dead as well as writers and books and assorted artists that've given her joy over the years.

Nearing 80, Grumbach plans a party for her friends and in the process, introduces us to influential friends who are no longer with us &amp; are therefore unable to attend her gathering. The book is filled with quotes and reflections about the aging/old age process-- both the positives and the negatives. After reading her book, you'll want to &quot;chain&quot; to the authors she cites (May Sarton, Thomas Merton, Virginia Woolf) and wish you had received an invitation to her party."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of their Company","review":"Having read this book in May 2000, this reader found the first forty to fifty pages succulent, rich and delightful, containing small but piercing apercus, literary references and remarks, close-caputuring of moments of insight and experience well-expressed.There is a certain suspense, too, as she worries over the party she is going to throw for her 80th birthday. Will it go off well? Will she have made peace with herself by the time the party happens?Disappointingly, she never describes the party or the people who attend it. The party is over in a flash and she dourly writes, \\"It's over. The party is over.\\"There are lots of pages devoted to memories that have no particular appeal to the reader. There's a lot of irritating name-dropping, outdoing Anais Nin and her diaries in this feature since Ms. Grumbach appears to have had the correct social card to allow her to enter into the Elite's social realm since she was a famous person knowing other famous personalities. Most of the writing here about Thomas Merton and his love affair with a nurse, however, is simply beside the point. Her insight into Thomas Merton is negligible. What really is the connection between a straight Roman Catholic and a lesbian Unitarian? The religious insights she does offer made this reader wonder how she spiritually and satisfyingly feeds her soul with such flat ideas.She mentions nearly being raped by Bertrand Russell! What she objects to about the rape is that he is a Nobel Prize winner; she did not object to his character, his lack of integrity; she did not even object to the aggression. Such talk made this woman seem fatuous and silly, pretentious. Her remarks about Samuel Becket were, at best, provocative.This reader didn't find this memoir as good as \\"Extra Innings.\\" It was more like a good long letter, informing the reader of her progress while exploring that strange (still) foreign country known as Old Age."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of their Company","review":"Doris does it again.

An outstanding critical work."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"This book deserves six stars. It is the companion book to \\"An Introduction to the Sun and Stars\\", (actually there are four books in the series but these two are the most closely related). I bought both books to follow-up the introductory astronomy text \\"Voyages to the Stars and Galaxies\\" by Fraknoi, Morrison, and Wolff. I was so impressed with \\"Voyages\\", it has been the standard by which I have measured other astronomy texts. \\"Sun and Stars\\", was an excellent book, but it didn't quite measure up to the clarity of \\"Voyages\\". In contrast, \\"Galaxies and Cosmology\\" is every bit as good as \\"Voyages\\". The scope is more limited than \\"Voyages\\", but the depth of the material covered is deeper. It is a perfect book to follow an introductory text such as \\"Voyages\\". Where \\"Voyages\\" gave a broad introduction to astronomy with essentially no math, \\"Galaxies and Cosmology\\" follows up with a more in depth treatment of galactic astronomy and cosmology that includes a fair amount of math, but nothing beyond basic algebra. Only algebra? Absolutely! This text walks an incredible line between a purely conceptual book, and a university level math heavy text for an astronomy major.As with \\"An Intro to the Sun and Stars\\", \\"An Intro to Galaxies and Cosmology\\" has an excellent set of questions and problems which do a very good job of illuminating and clarifying key concepts. The problems are not difficult, requiring nothing more than a decent high school math background including algebra and trigonometry, but their strength is in illuminating the concepts beyond just a descriptive narrative. The problems are not as in depth or rigorous as you might find in a degree oriented program in astronomy, but they are certainly rewarding for the interested amateur, and will take you a step beyond purely descriptive introductions.CONTENTThe book covers the following material, (if you don't want to read about every chapter, just skip to the summary).Chapter 1 - The Milky Way GalaxyA very good description of how we have come to know what we do about our Galaxy, the Milky Way, including how we determine size, mass, shape, etc.Chapter 2 - Normal GalaxiesDescribes the standard Hubble classification of galaxies including how we are able to determine such things as their size, mass, and composition. Provides a clear indroduction to theories of the formation and evolution of galaxies, and includes a an excellent description of the methods used to determine galactic distances.Chapter 3 - Active GalaxiesVery good introduction to quasars, radio galaxies, Seyferts, and other galaxies with an active galactic nucleus, and the theories of what produces the incredible amounts of power emanating from the center of these galaxies. Also has an excellent detailed description of galactic spectra.Chapter 4 - The Spatial Distribution of GalaxiesNice introduction to large scale structure within the universe, including galaxy clusters, superclusters, and larger scale structure. Talks about recent and on-going surveys to map out these large scale structures. Also includes a nice description of how the distribution of intergalactic gas clouds can be investigated via a spectral feature known as the Lyman alpha forest. Also provides a pretty good explanation of the reionization epoch.Chapter 5 - Introducing Cosmology - The Science of the UniverseThis was one of my favorite chapters. It briefly introduces General Relativity's Field Equations and then introduces the main cosmological models that have been derived from them. At this level, the introduction is essentially conceptual, but amazingly the authors have been able to use only algebra to give greater insight into the concepts and to give a feel for some of the quantitative issues. If you have ever wanted to really know about Einstein's cosmological constant, or exactly what the FRW models are and where Einstein's initial model of the universe fits in relation to these, this is the book to get. Other topics touched on include how Hubble's constant is tied to cosmology, what vacuum energy density is, what cosmological models say about the age of the universe, and a whole host of other interesting topics.Chapter 6 - Big Bang Cosmology - The Evolving UniverseFollowing chapter 5's introduction to the various models of the universe consistent with General Relativity, chapter 6 goes into more detail about the early universe in those models which begin with a \\"big bang\\". This chapter walks you through the first fractions of a second, minutes, and years following the \\"big bang\\". It goes into more detail about energy density, the interaction of fundamental particles and forces, recombination, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, among other things. This was the only chapter however that did seem a little dry in parts... primarily the sections on nucleosyntheis. The material was well covered though, so it is probably just a reflection of what interests me and what does not rather than a reflection on the book.Chapter 7 - Observational Cosmology - Measuring the UniverseChapter 7 picks up again with a thoroughly fascinating discussion of astronomers' efforts to measure the primary parameters associated with the FRW models that would determine what kind of universe we actually live in. The parameters include the Hubble constant, the deceleration parameter, and several density parameters. The last part of the chapter provides an excellent introduction on how the angular power spectrum of the CMB is being used as one method to determine the cosmological parameters to great precision, (basically curve fitting). Overall, this is one of the most interesting chapters in the book.Chapter 8 - Questioning Cosmology - Outstanding Problems About the UniverseThis closing chapter highlights some of the questions yet to be answered. Perhaps of necessity details are rather slim in this chapter, but it still provides a nice end of book perspective on how much we still don't know. The questions discussed include,1. What is dark matter? -- A discussion of MACHOS and WIMPS2. What is dark energy? -- Einstein's cosmological constant? Quantum vacuum energy? Quintessence?3. Why is the universe so uniform?4. Why does the universe have a flat geometry?5. Where did the structure come from?Inflation theory could solve these three, but inflation is still a theory with many unanswered questions. Some of these are discussed.6. Why is there more matter than antimatter? -- lack of baryon number conservation at extremely high energies?7. What happened at t=0? -- a few paragraphs mentioning chaotic inflation, quantum cosmology, and m-theory.8. Why is the Universe the way it is? - Why do the fundamental constants of nature have the values they do? A discussion of the anthropic principle.SUMMARYBottom line is this is an excellent introduction to galactic astronomy and cosmology. It is recommended that you have some understanding of stellar astronomy including basic stellar evolution such as you would find in an introductory book such as \\"Voyages to the Stars and Galaxies\\" by Fraknoi, Morrison, and Wolff or \\"An Introduction to the Sun and Stars\\" by Green and Jones, and that your be comfortable with basic algebra and trig, but beyond that the book is very self contained and rewarding to read. It is a perfect balance between armchair reading and textbook. I only wish more popular science books were written at this level.As a side note, if anyone knows of other astronomy texts written at a similar level, leave a comment. I would love to find other texts at the level and quality of this one."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"I think this is a great intermediate level book on galaxies and cosmology. The writing style is clear and easy to follow. There are many useful diagrams and a fair number of beautiful images.The first part of the book focuses on galaxies. The Milky Way is the subject of the first chapter. In addition to providing a nice description of the galaxy we live in, a lot of concepts are introduced that are needed for the remainder of the book. This includes things like globular clusters, open clusters, density waves, stellar halos, HR diagrams, rotation curves and dark matter.This is followed by a chapter on normal galaxies. The Hubble classification of galaxies is covered here. The treatment goes beyond morphology, it also describes the properties these classifications have (for example mass to gas ratio) and how they are measured. A very high level view of structure formation is given. This topic is treated in more detail in the cosmology part. The extremely important topic of the cosmological distance ladder is covered.The following chapter on active galaxies is excellent. In addition to describing the types of active galaxies, it explains the current models of how they are powered. It also provides reasons for thinking that they are fundamentally the same kind of thing, just being viewed in different ways by us. This is followed by a chapter on the large scale distribution of galaxies which provides a nice transition to the study of cosmology.The cosmology part is equal in quality to the galaxies part. It opens with a qualitative discussion of general relativity. Obviously it isn't very detailed, the most complicated part presented is the Robertson-Walker line element. However it's enough to motivate important things like the cosmological redshift, the cosmological constant and the critical density. This basic material is built upon to discus dark matter (both baryonic and non-baryonic), structure formation, anisotropies in the microwave background (the detail here was more than I expected form an introductory book, it actually went a bit into multipole expansions), problems with the standard cosmology (standard here meaning pre-inflation, today it would probably be safe to say that inflation is now the standard) and inflation (no details to speak of, just qualitative).In summary I think this is a great book, suitable for students without any previous knowledge of the topics. Most of the concepts from astronomy needed are described, but not covered in detail. This includes things like population I/II/III starts, variable stars and what astronomers mean when they say \\"metal\\". This is a lot of information for someone without any background in astronomy. Such people would probably have a fairly tough time following the presentation, but could probably still do it with sufficient motivation. I would expect the best audience would be undergraduate astronomy students. More advanced students would probably be familiar with most of the material, but may still enjoy it because the presentation is so good."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"I was amazed by this book, as well as by the others completing the series. The argument is handled in a very clear way and I really believe this book is just perfect for those starting their interest or studies in astronomy. It is well up-to-date and provides nice images.Definitely a must have, also for those working in different areas and wishing to 2refresh2 their knowledge."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"This text should really be entitled \\"Cosmology, with a brief look at galaxies\\", and it may do the trick if your main interest is cosmology.At most, only three stars, because this book provides only a brief overview of galaxies, and the chapters on galaxies are full of oversimplifications and outmoded ideas.I, personally, was frustrated that this book leaves out so much of importance about normal galaxies - but you may find the brevity & simplicity of the exposition on normal galaxies (100 pages, minimal equations) to your liking. If you are looking for a detailed and up-to-date textbook about Galaxies, Jones and Lambourne is NOT what you should read:This book exhibits, in several places, the typical deficiencies of some introductory \\"overview\\" textbooks:leaving out important details, quite often presenting very outmoded concepts as present day truth, and hurriedly and inaccurately characterizing some issues. As one example, the \\"knowledge\\" presented in this book about galaxies of Hubble type S0 is virtually non-existent - there are only a few lines about S0 galaxies; not enough text to explain anything about them really, and not enough to get you interested in the incredible controversies that have surrounded them for the last few decades. As another example, the section on Hubble Classification of galaxies tells the reader nothing about how galaxies are actually classified using today's more sophisticated and accurate versions of the Hubble classification system (e.g. Hubble-de Vaucouleurs-Buta; Hubble-Sandage; Kormendy's \\"physical classification\\" system ; Quantitative Classification Systems; etc.). As a third example, this book tells the reader little about the last 30 years of research regarding the shapes and ages and kinematics of the bulge components that exist within disk galaxies. Needless to say, the study of the kinematics of galaxies, which is today's state-of-the art method for understanding the components and the history of a galaxy, is given only a short section in this book.This book is emphatically NOT about galaxies in detail, and presents only a sketch about the objects we call galaxies. One indeed gets the impression that the authors themselves are not really very knowledgeable about today's work on galaxies; for instance they use the descriptor \\"nuclear bulge\\" for the bulge component of a galaxy, a confusing usage that has not been used by practicing researchers for decades!!Thus, this book most emphatically does not provide a detailed and up-to-date view about galaxies, whatever the merits of the sections on cosmology.This is an introductory college or first-year-university -level text which \\"talks down to you\\" and simplifies to the maximum extent possible, while still including a reasonable level of detail. It includes a modest amount of very simple algebra. It is similar in level to other very-elementary astronomy textbooks at the first year level, but contrasts with the general astronomy textbooks, in that it is squarely focused on cosmology. One deficiency, for those who mainly want to know about galaxies, is that most of the text is really about cosmology - and that merely two chapters are devoted to the gigantic topics of the Milky Way and the properties & morphologies of galaxies. These two chapters are sufficient to give an outdated \\"sketch\\" of how professional astronomers understand galaxies, but that is all.Ultimately, if your interest is galaxies rather than cosmology, this book contains only a limited amount of information."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"Jones / Lambourne (Editors) \\"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmolgy\\" covers a complex topic in a well written fashion; simple without being simplistic. Math problems are presented with solutions to all questions. The Algebra required is nothing more than what would be learned by the end of the half-semester of a first year course. I now own eight astronomy texts--incliuding Kaufmann and Seeds--and this offers an excellent overview of astrohysics."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology","review":"I would like to echo the three reviews posted thus far about this textbook. In fact, I used the Jones/Lambourne textbook as a \\"supplementary textbook\\" for a course I recently took on Galaxies, as part of a graduate degree (M.Sc.) program I am taking in Astronomy. The assigned textbook for the Galaxies course was \\"Galaxies in the Universe: An introduction\\" by Sparke and Gallagher. This latter book is packed with a lot of mathematics, but I frankly found that it did not supply as clear or as concise an entry point to the study of galaxies, as the Jones/Lambourne book did. By the end of the course, I had caught up to the presentation in the Sparke/Gallagher book; but in large part, I attribute this \\"catch-up\\" to the clarity, detail and presentation of the Jones/Lambourne book that I read alongside the Sparke/Gallagher text.In regards to the Jones/Lambourne book itself, the authors did a very good job in introducing the reader to the study of all aspects of galaxies and galaxy clusters, including galaxy formation, galaxy characterization and all sorts of associated special galaxy phenomena (ie., Seyferts, BL Lac objects, Blazars, quasars, Unified Model, etc.). The mathematics in the book is presented in a very straightforward way and assumes (a) that the reader is starting with very limited knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution, and (b) is prepared to put in time to thoroughly understand the subject.The second part of the text is about cosmology, and is just as good as the first part of the text about galaxies. Again all aspects of cosmology are broken down in a clear and concise way. Indeed, I used this text as an \\"initial jumping off\\" point for a research paper on the cosmic microwave background. While it covers this topic in the way you would expect of a textbook (ie., at the cursory, 30,000 foot level), the presentation was such that one could easily move from the understanding provided by the text directly into the research in the area. Vis a vis the cosmology aspects of the book, I compared the Jones/Lambourne text with the book written by Schneider (called \\"Extargalactic Astronomy and Cosmology\\"). This latter book is very informative, but again for those seeking a high level \\"introductory\\" book into the study of Cosmology, the Jones/Lambourne book is a must-have in terms of its overall clarity of presentation. By way of example, the subject of cosmology has much more mathematics associated with it, and the Jones/Lambourne book did a great job of exposing the reader to this mathematics in a clear and meaningful way.If you want to learn a lot about Galaxies and Cosmology, your library should probably include all three of the above books (by Sparke/Gallagher, Jones/Lambourne and Schneider), but if you want to start with only one text and work deeper into the subject more slowly, then the Jones/Lambourne book is the best and clearest entry point. The authors have a done a first-rate job with this book. Even if you are not studying the subject formally, the Jones/Lambourne book is so nicely written that the book serves well as a good read for anyone interested in galaxies and cosmology."},{"Title":"The nature of the physical world, (The Gifford lectures)","review":"This is an extremely good book that contains a series of lectures delivered to lay audience by this great physicist.

She led a healthy life, no smoking, no drinking; but at the age of forty-seven there she was, rationing out Clark bars on Halloween, from a hospital bed we had set up in our living room.This is how it happened. One day my mom sneezed and fell down a flight of stairs. A doctor gave her an X-Ray, and discovered a tumor - like a teakettle she left boiling too long on the stove - sitting on her lung. A year later she was gone.For some people, cancer is not a choice, but a way of life. For Rell De-Mello, the feisty Kailua High School sophomore in Dorothea Buckingham's Staring Down the Dragon, it's an end-less supply of embarrassing moments. A glowing example of \\"successful\\" cancer treatment, Rell spends what should be her first day back at school, hiding out in McDonalds. Concealing her bald head under a wig, Rell has lost her eyelashes, her eyebrows, and as far as she's concerned, her future dating prospects. Even Rell's reliable 34 B chest has taken a vacation after chemotherapy for Hodgkin's' Disease.At school, people treat her like a star. She walks into a standing ovation in English class, gets special treatment from teachers, and Wanda Yamanaka wants her to write an inspirational piece for the school paper on \\"what it was like to almost die.\\" But Rell knows what people really want to hear: \\"Once upon a time Estrella DeMello had cancer, and she lived happily ever after\\".Like most girls in Hawaii, Rell dreams of handsome surfers and limbo parties with \\"six-foot-three lifeguards pouring pina coladas down her throat\\". But sun-screen, therapy sessions, blood tests, and endless precautions - like making sure her dog doesn't make her sick - won't allow her to forget that she's different. Even her best friend Emi calls her the \\"Cancer Queen\\" when her disease threatens to overwhelm their friendship.The only person Rell feels safe with is LB, her old roomie from Stanhope Hospital. But LB's leukemia may make that Grand Canyon trip they've been planning a thing of the past. It's only when Rell meets Nate Lee, a handsome junior with a secret of his own, that Rell decides to let somebody in. With love and understanding, Nate shows her that cancer doesn't have to take over her life.Novels about illness usually have their work cut out for them, and as great as these books may be, their subject matter alone gives you the awkward feeling of waiting for test results. But Dragon is first and foremost about being a teenager, and Buckinghamcaptures the essence of high school experience.Like the best teen novels, Staring Down the Dragon is great because it's honest. Rell doesn't teach us to live every moment as if it's our last. She acts like the rest of us: scared, uncertain, and looking for answers. Cancer survivors don't feel quite like anybody else, and Dorothea Buckingham lends Rell an authentic voice by letting us see just how difficult it is for someone recovering from cancer to begin to feel normal again.An uplifting story about overcoming fear, and accepting change, Staring Down the Dragon is really about living after cancer - maybe the hardest journey of all.Staring Down the Dragon by Dorothea N. BuckinghamSydney Press, 207 pgs."},{"Title":"Staring Down the Dragon","review":"Being a teenager is difficult enough, but when you're recovering from cancer it's worse. Estrella \\"Rell\\" DeMello is returning to Kailua High School after having left to undergo a treatment program for cancer. Now in remission, Rell has to contend with everyone knowing that she truly is \\"different\\" and as well deal with the constant threat of a relapse. While Rell would like to pretend that she is just a normal teen, she must adjust from a life where her illness was always her family's focus. Rell copes through this and the traumas of just being a teenager by relying on her sardonic sense of humor, her best friend Emi, and the support of her family.Taking place on the island of Oahu, Buckingham does an exemplary job conveying the flavors and people of Hawaii. In Rell she has created a character who speaks with the authentic voice of a teenager, at times childish and at other times painfully mature. Although suffering from a cruel illness, Rell's sharp wit and strength make her a very likeable and admirable character.This is a wonderfully entertaining read that isn't just a \\"cancer book.\\" All teens will be able to relate with Rell's dealings with the popular girls, monstrous teachers, and the chance at a new romance. Parents as well will be able to sympathize with Rell's mother, a woman who feels unbearably guilty for not protecting Rell from the illness and yet who must also learn to let Rell grow up on her own. Anyone whose family has been touched by cancer or who has even just been a teenager will find comfort and joy in this novel."},{"Title":"Staring Down the Dragon","review":"Cancer scares me.

It can kill you,' Mom said.\\" 'Bacon can kill me. Eggs can kill me.'\\" 'Rell, you don't know what having a dog in the house, letting him sleep with you, having him lick you can do. You don't know what you're risking,' Mom said.\\"STARING DOWN THE DRAGON is painfully realistic. The manner in which it is written with an abundance of dialogue gives the story an immediacy that flings the reader into the seat of the roller coaster that is Rell's life.A minor quibble with the book is that the occasional error in punctuation makes you think you're reading an advance copy, but such errors are easily forgiven in light of the strength of the story Rell shares with us.Knowledge often brings understanding and compassion and acceptance to that which was previously unknown. Readers of STARING DOWN THE DRAGON will certainly gain an understanding of the disease's psychological effects on those suffering from or recovering from it, and Its effects on those around them.Richie Partingtonhttp://richiespicks.comBudNotBuddy@aol.com"},{"Title":"Staring Down the Dragon","review":"The slim-novel equivalent of a well-meaning afterschool special, this story of a Kailua High cancer survivor is told with economy and grace.

Due to inadequate travel insurance, he was faced with the prospect of spending three weeks in the Caribbean alone on what would have been his honeymoon. Less than pleased, he finally surrenders to the idea of going. A decision which will ultimately be made a little easier when he later spies his beautiful travel agent-topless-on the beach in Cozumel.Extensive renovations to her office building hampered the travel agency's ability to bring in new vacation business and gave Taylor DeWitt an excuse to visit some properties in the Caribbean, topped off by a few days to herself in Cozumel. It was the first vacation she had taken in years and she relished the prospect of sun, sand and perhaps a wild vacation fling. How could she have imagined that her handsome and disgruntled customer would become her lover for the week?What happens when a vacation fling follows you home to the real world? Can ghosts of the past be set aside and hearts healed?SLIPPERY WHEN WET is a must-have for a day at the beach! Dev and Taylor have much in common, their attraction and lusty adventures are a treat to read. Ms. Hardy's talent for weaving creative and sizzling love scenes keeps the reader enthralled and on the edge of her seat! The hero and heroine also share heartache and betrayal in their respective pasts, so this colors their initial view of a relationship and sows the seeds of the obstacle they will face.SLIPPERY WHEN WET is the third book of Ms. Hardy's UNDER THE COVERS trilogy. Although part of a series, it stands alone well. However, I urge all readers to also pick up the author's previous titles, especially my personal favorite, AS BAD AS CAN BE. -- Melissa Freeman"},{"Title":"Slippery When Wet","review":"FROM: Romance Reviews TodayThe last person Taylor DeWitt expected to see as she sunbathed nude in the warm Cozumel sun was the man who had stormed out of her travel agency just two weeks ago. Even though she understood Dev Carson's plight -- what man would want to go on his honeymoon without a bride? -- she was still unable to refund his money, since the insurance he chose didn't cover canceled weddings. Now, after two weeks of reviewing property in the Caribbean, Taylor plans to spend the next few days relaxing on the beach with romance novels and sleeping in. But there he stands, looking like a bronzed god with an ironic grin on his face as he gazes down at her unclad body. Is he simply toying with her when he asks her for a date, or is he serious when he says he would like to make her vacation unforgettable? Either way, Taylor can't deny her attraction to him and succumbs to the temptation to have an affair with a man who looks like a model in one of her brochures.Trying to forget how his fianc&eacute;e cheated on him, Dev has spent the past two weeks immersing himself in this exotic, uninhibited culture. When he sees the prim lady who refused to refund his honeymoon deposit sunbathing topless, he decides to have some payback. What starts out as petty revenge quickly turns into lust and excitement, though, since Dev is fascinated by Taylor. When he asks her if she would like to spend the rest of her vacation with him, he is delighted when she accepts. He sets out to make sure this is a trip she will not soon forget, and together they explore pleasure in paradise. Dev is reluctant to see it end, even though they have agreed to go their separate ways once their vacation is over. The time he has spent with Taylor has convinced him that she is the perfect match for him, even if she won't admit it to herself. Can he convince Taylor that their affair can last for the rest of their lives?Taylor is just as fascinated with Dev, but refuses to allow herself to be controlled by another man. She went through that with her first husband, and she has become an independent woman. Now Dev wants to take their relationship to a whole new level, and Taylor isn't ready. Can she overcome her fear of failing in another relationship? Should she put her faith in Dev, with whom she can so easily be herself?Hot, sexy and just plain fun, SLIPPERY WHEN WET by Kristin Hardy is an erotic rollercoaster ride of witty dialogue and great characters! Taylor is a woman not afraid to take chances, except when it comes to matters of the heart. Her growth as a person who can trust her instincts about relationships is a major theme, and readers will easily identify with it and her. Dev is just the man for her, more than happy showing her the fun that can be had in their tryst, and how much more it could be if she would only believe in him. He is charismatic and an adventurer. Their intimate encounters are passionate and frequent, especially while they are in Cozumel, but never overwhelm the love story. The beauty and wildness of this land adds to the intense and heated love scenes in this book.A fantastic read for a cool summer night, SLIPPERY WHEN WET by Kristin Hardy is a must read! -- Courtney Bowden"},{"Title":"Slippery When Wet","review":"In Baltimore, hard working travel agency owner Taylor DeWitt looks forward to her Caribbean tour of combining business with pleasure.

Unfortunately, it's not much help with the most difficult part of the game - unit management and overall strategy - and doesn't include quick reference materials. I knock off a star each for the lack of in-depth strategic help as well as a value proposition that isn't great, but since the game didn't include much of this material as it should have I still recommend purchase.First, the positives. This guide has very, very detailed walkthroughs of the single player scenarios for America, Korea, and Germany, along with Turning Point. In addition, it has detailed numbers on every unit and special unit in the game along with technologies and upgrades. Finally, there are a few extra bonuses, like resource locations on the premade multiplayer maps (so make sure never to agree to a game on one!) As such, this is a useful reference as it has a whole bunch of things that weren't included with the game as they should have been.However, this disappoints on the strategy side. While they do discuss civilization strengths and weaknesses, there's not a whole lot of analysis. I expected a detailed breakdown of civilzation versus civilzation by era; instead, the best you get is about half a page per civilization total. Hints and tips are equally disappointing. (An example: \\"Pay attention to civilzation bonuses.\\" Wouldn't have thought that one up on my own.) Moreover, as Sierra skimped on certain essentials that should have been included with the game - like a technology and unit tree - one would have expected they'd have been included with this guide as say a end-cover foldout. They weren't.Still, this is worth buying solely for the unit reference material, at least until some devotees of the game put that on the web in accessible format. It just that this guide could have been far more."},{"Title":"WORLDS OF PAIN Life in the working-Class Family","review":"Lilian Rubin writes with an empathy that could only come from being the product of a working-class family herself. Unfortunately, the baggage which Rubin's brings along on her study tends to butt in inappropriately. In the chapter on the subject's childhood, for example, Rubin concludes that all of the subjects must have been unhappy during their early years because she could recall her &quot;own impoverished background.&quot; It did not matter to Rubin that her subjects &quot;implored, even commanded [her], to believe they had happy home lives as children.&quot;It should also be noted that this study was conducted in 1972. While there is a fairly significant new introduction which Rubin wrote in 1992, the text of the book is unchanged. Certainly much has changed in the past twenty years. Both in terms of the jobs of the working-class, the sex lives of working-class couples, the reasons they marry, and even the definition of working-class itself.In short, an interesting read by a talented writer.

I have a number of martial arts books and have found too many are just a collection of techniques. In this book Sean Stark introduces a series of core evasions and then proceeds to show how they lead into other actions, such as strikes, throws, and joint locks. He also demonstrates how the art employs positioning to outflank an opponent. In my opinion, this is one of the characteristics that makes Pencak Silat so effective. It is apparent that Pencak Silat Pertempuran is a very efficient and well-conceived martial art.This is a book I have read several times.

At the end of the book it has a review of the book's main themes that is very helpful as the book has 433 pages. I made it to page 410 thinking that most of the book was throughly researched although the resources were in the text itself and not all that clear in some instances points were made using science and logic but when I got to page 410 things took a drastic change seems the author believed that Jesus was a spiritual medium not a deity on the basis he knew people who were mediums. Seems science was only needed to prove Jesus wasn't a deity but seeing was believing for mediums no science needed.So for you readers out there like me who are strictly rationalists and lean strongly toward science and resources that may be a bit off putting.

The contrast between the two , Amundsen and Scott, is so striking, it is a wonder that Scott is generally remembered at all.His methods were so slack, his personality so ill-suited to the task at hand, his leadership bordered on being criminally negligent. Scott became that strange type of British hero, one whose incompetence is romanticized into fame( i.e. The Titanic or the Charge of the Light Brigade). Amundsen however, dispays all the qualities necessary for a polar explorer (or any leader). He was smart, adaptable, inventive, and organized. He did have some faults(somewhat unforgiving, vanity), but his results made him the greatest polar explorer of all time.His deeds included the Northwest Passage, 1st to winter in the Antarctic, Of course the South Pole, first to complete the Northeast and Northwest Passage, first to fly across the Arctic Ocean.He was a modern Viking, always seeking the unknown. It is somewhat baffling that he is not more recognized for his accomplishments."},{"Title":"SCOTT & AMUNDSEN.","review":"Scott and Amundsen is a study of two very different styles of leadership; that of Captain Robert F. Scott, RN of Great Britain and that of Roald Amundsen of Norway. It is a book well worth reading and is better than many contemporary leadership books. It is a study of men as well as countries. The Norwegians were able to maintain an oceanographic research vessel. The British had to make do with a converted sealing ship.Scotts style was that of a traditional Naval officer in a service that had great traditions but had become stagnant as it entered the 20th Century. Scott gave an order and expected a cherry aye, aye sir, regardless of the difficulty in it's execution. He was also a man who was looking over his shoulder at the runners behind him. In his first expedition to Antarctica, he had managed to alienate one of his co-members and turned him into a fierce rival, Ernest Shackelton. It was this rivalry that drove Scott. Scott is also a perfect example of the concept of responding to new developements with &quot;not invented here&quot;. Scott had several years between his two expeditions to plan, acquire proper material and train his expedition. The only original thinking was in the use of motor transport but then he fatally damaged this component when he jetisoned the principal technical officer that had worked on the motor sledges from the outset. Everything else was a rehash of his first expedition or that of Shackelton's. The use of horses in a desert environment, as the Antarctic is, was a tremendous failure that ultimately lead to the death of Scott and his party.Amundsen on the other hand was a keen student of the exploration craft. He was constantly working to refine his equipment. He was not afraid to adapt the ways of the natives he met on his expeditions, as well as take suggestions and examples from other explorers, such as Frederick Cook. Amundsen never asked his men to do something he would not do himself. He set the example. Of course he made errors along the way but he recognized them, and even if he didn't admit to them directly, he learned from them. He was single minded and remained faithful to his mission. He did not allow himself to be distracted by sentiment and worry. He flet that the prize of being first at the South Pole was the only thing that mattered. He was a trail blazer. The scientists could come after him.The two expeditions have been contrasted as a ful-blown assault and a raid. Amundsen's daring raid was a success and mounted as it was in the face of the challenge from Scott.This book by Huntford is not to be missed. It is a first class effort by an author who understands both the British and Norwegian mindsets. I would urge that this book be required reading for all future military officers."},{"Title":"SCOTT & AMUNDSEN.","review":"Scott and Amundsen is a study of the contrasting styles of management of two of the great polar explorers. Scott was driven by an ambitious wife to be great. In the process of achieving immortal fame, he captained one ship into a collision, after which he recouped his fall from grace by embarking on a quest with the full backing of the Royal Navy. He chose a smorgasboard of options for getting to the South Pole: tractors, Siberian ponies, and dogs. He chose a like-minded crew of enthusiasts who were for the most part amateurs. Enthusiasm untempered with wisdom had a price. One tractor sank through the ice upon debarking, the other broke down with mechanical problems. The Siberian ponies ended up as dog meat, and the sled team saved a large portion of those who turned back from the Pole. Scott reached the Pole but died on the return trip with four companions. His diaries (edited by his wife) established his undying fame. Amundsen borrowed his ship from the other great polar explorer, Nansen. He handpicked the crew, each of whom were specialists. They trained extensively, adapted the garb and transportation of the Inuit, i.e. anoraks and dogs, used skis to break the trail in front of the dogs and reached the Pole nearly a month before Scott. The trip was carefully planned with the primary source of energy being meat. Initially it was seal meat, shot near the Antarctic shelf, and frozen. In the final leg, the trek became a literal &quot;dog-eat-dog&quot; experience, as planned. No man died, and the apparent ease with which Amundsen reached the Pole led some to believe that Amundsen's path was the easier. It was not. I was so impressed with this book that I wrote to the author and received an autographed copy of a British paperback recently issued by Grove and Weidenfeld."},{"Title":"SCOTT & AMUNDSEN.","review":"Sad to see so many glowing reviews of this book.

Whether you agree with Huntford's conclusions or not, his study of Nansen, Amundsen and other Norwegian figures and their country and culture is one that we seldom get from the general US education accounts of these explorations.I recommend this book (or the abridged version that came out as \\"The Last Place on Earth\\") as a good starting place for people who think they might be interested in the \\"Great Polar Explorations,\\" because, even if you disagree with his assessment of the leading characters, Huntford does a very good job of laying out the essential problems and dynamics of Polar travel (without becoming completely bogged down in minutiae)."},{"Title":"SCOTT & AMUNDSEN.","review":"It has been over 80 years and only now the truth about 2 different Antartic expeditions have come to light.We can finally see Capt.

He or she is a mechanic with a toolbox of mostly behavioristic and cognitivistic wrenches and screwdrivers. He or she is often no better than the majority of medical model folks who knee-jerk a particular pill for a particular diagnosis. (Depression? Zoloft sertaline. Anxiety? Celexa citalopram. PTSD? Seroquel quetiapine. Bipolar? Lamictal lamotrigine.)The prescriptions may even work. But the patient never comes to terms with who he or she is. And when the patient's ship of (emotional) states hits the next hurricane, he or she is too often no better prepared for it than the last one.Laing was gone before SSRI's, atypical anti-psychotics and third-generation anti-convulsants hit the market. His passing also predated the revolutions lead by Skinner, Foa, Ellis and Beck. But he understood the \\"material\\" patients need to identify and \\"work on\\" at least as well as Erik Erickson, Jules Henry, Stephen Karpman, Eric Berne, Alice Miller, Gregory Bateson, Don Jackson, John Clausen, Theodore Lidz, Murray Bowen, John Weakland and Jay Haley.Moreover, his verbal finesse was the stuff the \\"classics\\" were made of. Few writers in any literary domain can match his metaphors. The \\"tennis game\\" on page 15 ranks with the famed \\"knots\\" he uses again here. His explanation of Bateson's \\"double-bind\\" and Watzlawick's \\"paradoxical injunction\\" (pp. 106-109) is far easier to grasp than either Bateson's or Watzlawick's.And no one among the several hundred authors I've encountered in this field has ever edified the secret rules of the games we play with family members and later projections thereof more elegantly -- and usefully -- than Laing.Regardless of the truly wonderful techniques we have today (including values clarification, critical thinking skills and mindfulness meditation), I'm forced by a quarter century of experience to blame the rather sorry state of psychotherapy on the following: Most therapists don't know what the problems really are. They may know =what= the patients think, but not truly =why= they think it.A course in Laing's works will clear that up in a hurry.

Given her status and also the fact that it was one of her early works that turned me on to this type of book in the first place I find that I have a hard time being critical when it comes to her publications. In this case however, I am afraid that critical I must be.As usual Mrs. Roberts writing style is wonderful and fluid without being wordy or pretentious. This author can frankly tell a story like no other and even though the stories in this book aren't all that good, Mrs. Roberts still managed to keep me riveted. This was quite an accomplishment seeing as how I had already heard almost all of the stories in this book at least once before. She comes quite close in fact to making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Close, but not quiet.I have learned over the years that Mrs. Roberts tends to produce two distinct types of ghost books. The really good ones are written after the author has traveled to the haunted sites she is writing about and has talked to people who have experienced the haunt first hand. The other types of book that she produces are basically fine examples of folklore or storytelling and nothing more. These are what I refer to as the \\"some say\\" or \\"they say\\" books because most of the stories end with a bit about how \\"They say\\" that on rainy nights you can still hear or see whatever it is the author has just written about. These types of books contain almost no recent eyewitness accounts and are just old legends handed down for generations. There is of course nothing wrong with this type of book except that they should not be sold as ghost books but should instead be marketed as folklore.There are a few very good stories in this book, but they are a distinct minority. The story about the modern day antics of the Bell Witch is an excellent story that includes all kinds of recent eyewitness accounts including some accounts of recent happenings from a direct descendent of old John Bell himself. This story is an example of Nancy Roberts at her best and that is the Nancy Roberts that I was looking for in this book. It is not however the Nancy Roberts that I found. I can't say that this was a bad book but I can say that she can do and has done so much better."},{"Title":"The Golden Treasury of Myths and Legends,","review":"Greek, Persian, and Norse legends wonderfully told alongside Alice and Martin Provensen's brilliant illustrations.

Randisi has put together a wonderful volume that I can go back to anytime and re-read with pleasure the many authors who have used their different talents and imaginations on paper. For instance, one of my favorite (although it is hard to chose a favorite in this book) is &quot;Cast-Iron Star&quot; where a young man rides into town, asks, or rather insists, that he get the job of County Marshal, and vows to bring a gang to an end. He doesn't want a tin star, because interspersed into this story is little bylines about how his dad had shot a man right through a tin star. This story has a marvelous twist and I don't want to reveal it, so that all might enjoy it, but I will say that you will be thrilled by this book. Many of the other short stories are also great, such as &quot;Fugitive Book&quot;, &quot;Woolies&quot;, &quot;Law West of Lonetree&quot;, &quot;Maintaine Le Droit&quot;, about a Mountie, &quot;Anna and the Players&quot;, etc. Another thing about this book is that in &quot;Woolies&quot; and &quot;Law West of Lonetree&quot;, the authors use black cowboys as their central theme, and I think that is is great to see this more and more in westerns coming out now.

When I was in high school, I shamelessly stole the title the title for an essay that I was writing about _The Brothers Karamazov_. I trust that the hounds of hell will not pursue me 'cross the desert of cactus and lodestone for this terrible sin. In any event, my use of the title-- on the complexity of the characters in Dostoyevsky-- had little to do with Biggle's use of the title-- on the spectroscopic vision of aliens.At the outset of the novel, Jan Darzek is a private investigator who owns stock in Universal Transmitting Company, an outfit that is working on developing a worldwide system of teleportation.* In fairly short order, Universal Trans is up and running. But almost as quickly, some people begin to enter the transporter gates-- and fail to arrive at their destinations. Darzek is hired to investigate the disappearances. He does, but then he also vanishes...I suspect that a system of teleportation wouldn't be accepted quite so quickly. But the details of how the investigation is conducted are nicely told, and the later twists and turns to the plot (there are many of them) are also well-handled. _All the Colors of Darkness_ is a solid science fiction adventure. As I have said elsewhere, Biggle was a good craftsman who usually managed to work a little something special into his novels.* This raises a completely irrelevant question. How many fictional P.I.s can you name who own stock? Not Sam Spade, Philip Marlow, or Lew Archer-- though that that All-American Tough Guy, Mike Hammer, might have some U.S. Savings Bonds. Lord Peter Wimsey and Albert Campion are independently wealthy. Some of that might might be from stocks, but I suspect that it is mostly Old Money. John Putnam Thatcher is a banker who advises clients on stocks and bonds. Yes, he would probably have a portfolio.

I didn't even realize until fairly recently that there are prequels! This book is adorable! I love that it is written for a younger reader in mind. Each chapter is fairly short and tells an experience that Alice has gone through. This book has a wonderful message about how it is much easier to be someone's friend than to be someone's enemy. I just think it is a fun, entertaining read even for adults."},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"Reynolds takes readers back to Alice's third-grade year, back when the McKinley family first moved to Takoma Park from Chicago. Eight-year-old Alice is nervous about beginning school in a new place, especially when she starts off on the wrong foot the very first day with three clique-ish girls she dubs the Terrible Triplets. Then, there's Donald, a classmate who is also Alice's new next-door neighbor, and his divorced mother who seems determined to marry Alice's widowed father. Add the fact that her brother Lester is having no trouble making lots of friends in high school, and Alice is sure life in third grade is going to be a disaster.But then Alice becomes friends with Rosalind, a mischievous classmate brimming with fun and crazy ideas. Before long, the duo adds Sara, a smart and serious girl, and things start looking up.Fans of the Alice books will enjoy this glimpse of the beloved character prior to the regular series' start, and younger readers can get a taste of this popular series with a book on a slightly more accessible level."},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"You could say that Alice McKinley (not to be confused with Alice MacLeod) has a bit of a cult following at my current place of employ. So maybe it was just a matter of time before I too got sucked in.A word on the series before I start the review: Phyllis Reynolds Naylor began the Alice series with \\"The Agonies of Alice\\" in 1985. In that book Alice is 11 and starting sixth grade. She has just moved and started at a new school. Since then, Naylor has been writing a new Alice book approximately every year which certain librarians have pointed out has strong addictive qualities. Until about 2002, the books ran linearly. Then Naylor did something different, she wrote three prequel novels talking about Alice as a third, fourth, and fifth grader weaving in stories that Alice had previously reflected on in other books in the series. \\"Starting With Alice\\" is the first of these prequels (followed by \\"Alice in Blunderland\\" and \\"Lovingly Alice\\"). I like to read linearly whenever possible so, after reading \\"The Agony of Alice\\" and finding out about these prequels I decided to read the series straight through in terms of Alice's age instead of publication date (the series is supposed to end when Alice turns 18 and is already well-grounded in the Young Adult genre at this point).Now that that's settled, let's talk about the actual book.Alice, her father, and her older brother have just moved into a new house. Alice's first friend on the block is Donald Sheavers, her weird neighbor. Along the way, Alice makes other, less weird, friends. And also attracts some unwanted attention from one of the street patrol girls. It's not always easy being Alice. I can't say much more about the story without revealing everything. This book is more about Alice's day-to-day life as she tries to fit in and make friends than about any huge event.Alice narrates in the first person. As a result, the novel is conversational and pretty mellow. Alice is a cool girl, even though she doesn't think so, and her narration is endearing. Naylor strikes the perfect balance here. Alice's voice is consistent with her debut novel, but she does sound younger--without being annonyingly young.Alice also demonstrates that, although she's only eight, it's never to early to develop a strong character. In the novel Alice makes new friends and stands up to bullies among her other wonderfully positive characteristics. I don't know that children read books about children in search of role models, but if they do \\"Starting With Alice\\" definitely offers up a good one.In terms of when to read this book, I think it would work either way. I enjoyed reading it already knowing about Donald Sheavers and an unfortunate poem written to the milkman. But readers could definitely read this without knowing anything about Alice and enjoy it just as much."},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"wow how in the world do i start! well i read this book in 3 days. each day i came home when out on the porch and started reading for about 3 to 4 hours!its about this girl alice her mom dies when she was young and she has a older brother lester.this was the first book i read and now i have read about 5 or 6 alice books now.alice goes through friendship trouble and other stuff too.its a really good book for girls.i also read the boys start the war by:pyills too.i read that in 3 days too.both of these books are amazing!naylor is my favorite author!in boys start the war there is pranks that the boys do to the girls then the girls do something and get them back and its filled w/ laughter!GET IT! if this review helped please click yes under my reviewthanks!i reccommend it!cya later!have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"This book was free with a purchase of my Leopard Build-a-Bear when I was nine or ten.

Hopefully readers connect with Alice as they learn about her bluffs through this school year. I would recommend it to anyone seven through eleven.

I love these books and have read nearly every one of them. It gives a clear perspective on a young girl's (at first) and then a teenage girl's life.

Can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"The book \\"Starting With Alice\\" is written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. It's about a girl living with her brother and dad in a new house in a new town.Lynol is Alice's brother. He is 15, so he really doesn't pay much attention. He is more concerned with his new band he put together with his new friends,\\"The Naked Nomads\\". They're called that because while they're performing they have no shirts on.Roslynn is Alice's new best friend. She is chubby with brown curly hair. She is in the same third grade class as Alice.Sara is not originally Alice's friend because she doesn't wash her hair and she eats with her mouth open. Alice comes up with an idea to invite her to a SHAMPOO PARTY. Now she washes her hair and chews with her mouth shut.Oatmeal is a cat. She is a black and gray striped tabby. She was found roaming around the yard. She became friends with the neighbor dog Killer, whose real name is Muffin.Finally, Alice. She is not very tall with red hair. She is very adventureous. She always hatches a plan for something. She can really let her mind wander too.In this book the McKennley family must move to another state because Alice's mother has died. The kids make friends,including a cat, who have adventures they like and some they don't like but always have fun. They meet enemies who turn into friends and enemies who are just enemies. Like the evil crossing guard Hilary.The setting of this book is present day chicago.I think the theme of this story, the underlying meaning,is friendship. This book deserves another 1/2 a star because it teaches the true meanig of friendship, BUBBLES!, but seriously this book is funny, sad, emotional, and serious at the same time. I'm going to pull a \\"Reading Rainbow \\" and say that you don't have to take my word for it, read it yourself, it's good."},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"The Alice books began years ago, with a new book appearing every few years, like the Ramona series by Beverly Cleary. The Alice books are sweet without being sappy, real without being overdramatic. Alice is a quirky strawberry blond girl who is trying to figure out who she is and how this crazy thing called life works. However, Alice's original stories were for slightly older girls than the Judy Moody set, as they began when Alice was in junior high and continued into high school.Luckily for younger readers, Naylor has decided to write three prequels featuring Alice in grade school. Starting With Alice features the protagonist at age 8, tackling a new town and the third grade with enthusiasm. Along the way, she makes some new friends, gets a cat, attends a wedding, attends a funeral, confronts bullies and continues to learn about the world around her.I read this book cover to cover, with giggles and sighs in all the appropriate places.

The Alice prequels have an innocent charm similar to that of Beverly Cleary's \\"Ramona Quimby\\" books. In this novel, Alice has just moved to Maryland and is starting the third grade. The book begins with Alice listing her likes and dislikes, and we can see the start of the Alice we know and love in this little girl. The book covers a year of her life, showing her early embarrassments and triumphs, some of which are mentioned later on in other books, some brand new. Remember the poem for the milkman ..?..

Alice is 8 and in 3rd grade. Her mother died long ago and she lives with her father and older brother. They have just moved to Takoma Park, Maryland. Alice is having trouble making friends. But she soon sees that there are some great parts about her new life. This book was fantastic and I would recommend it and the rest of the series for people who like to read series.

I have read a few of the other Alice books and they are great, but this is geared for a younger audience. I believe any young girl could empathize with Alice's trials & tribulations, being called into the principal's office for disregarding the cross-walk guard because she has it \\"in\\" for you, as well as rejoice with her triumphs, inviting your peer tormentors to a party and having them show up with gifts!I think this is an excellent book for kids and their parents, who often forget just how difficult it is to be a kid!"},{"Title":"Starting with Alice","review":"I couldn't put this book down!

I figured that it would probably be another boring book about some girls' life. When I realized who it was written by, I thought it must be somewhat of a good book (since I loved the Shilo books so much). I began to read, and I loved it. I could relate to some of what Alice was thinking and feeling. I never knew I could find a book that I loved so much.Now, I have collected all of the Alice books and I'm waiting for more. I have even interested my friends in the books. Two went out and bought some of the series, and one just borrows mine. I think Mrs. Naylor should keep up the good work and writing books that I seem to love so much. I also like that Alice is girl about my age growing up in an average, middle class, well brought up family. I think most girls who like Phyllis Reynold Naylor's writing, and enjoy stories they can relate to will definitely enjoy the Alice books.P.S.

However, if you have read past all the \\"superficial\\" works and are ready to \\"dig down to the nitty-gritty\\", then this is definitely the book for you on Cranmer. My humble suggestion: Read the popular books on Henry III's reign, stay away from the \\"romantic novels\\" of the time. If you are still wanting to dig, do some basic readings on Cromwell and More before you tackle this one. However, if you are sufficiently prepared, be ready to enjoy a very thorough account of one of King Harry's most trusted advisers.

MacCulloch shows himself as well acquainted with Cranmer's theology, with not much, if any, of an axe to grind along with a penetrating grasp of the historical complexities that engulfed the Reformer's life.

The author also does a great job of showing how Cranmer's theology developped over time.

MacCulloch claims that Cranmer's eucharistic theology stems from the Swiss Reformed tradition: one had only to read Basil Hall's essay in &quot;Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar&quot; edited by Ayris and Selwyn to see that this is demonstrably false. Cranmer was heavily influenced by Lutheranism as well as by the &quot;exposition of the most holy and learned fathers and martyrs&quot; of &quot;the holy catholic church of Christ from the beginning&quot; (Cranmer's words) and as such his theology clearly stands in the same line as that of Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes. This sort of &quot;scholarship&quot; with an obvious ax to grind is perhaps the worst sort. If you want to know Cranmer's views on the Sacraments (as most Anglicans or scholars of the Reformation do) please read him in his own words in &quot;A Defense of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ&quot; (if you can find a copy in the library) or in &quot;Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar.&quot;"},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Provides supplementary reading for Michael Davies classic, Cranmers Godly Order."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Unbelievable in this age of information that folk still Laud a man who even his contemporary Bishop of Winchester reviled for his duplicity and hypocrisy .This is the man, after all,who while the Tyrant Henry Rex still reigned ,tied many a protestant to the stake for not being Catholic,yet on Henry's death turned about face and started burning folk for being Catholic.No amount of Hume-like Historical whitewash can detract from the facts of History as we now have them.William Cobbett-Historian, describes Cranmer as the prince of hypocrites.The English Protestant reformation was a work of lust and plunder from beginning to end and Cranmer and his ilk quashed the true and natural religion which for 900 years had sustained England and kept her happy and free.They had to initiate change of course to give some sort of legitimacy to their rapine.Compare the peaceful introduction of Catholicism into England by St Augustin and a handful of monks to the industrially cruel and violent nature of the imposition of Protestantism.Apples and Oranges!To quote Cobbett (1824)(A Protestant)\\"..a fair and honest inquiry will teach us that this was an alteration greatly for the worse; that the \\"Reformation,\\" as it is called,was engendered in lust,brought forth in hypocrisy and perfidy,and cherished and fed by plunder,devastation,and rivers of innocent English and Irish Blood; and that as to its more remote consequences,they are,some of them,now before us,in that misery,that beggary,that nakedness,that hunger,that everlasting wrangling and spite,which now stare us in the face,and stun our ears at every turn,and which the \\"Reformation\\" has given us in exchange for the ease,and happiness,and harmony, and Christian charity,enjoyed so abundantly and for so many ages by our Catholic forefathers...\\"Englishmen would better spend their time researching that idyll of a country that was so cruelly ripped from them for the gain of an elite few and how Pauperism and Poor-laws were unknown before Henry's diabolical theft of Church property,property used for the beneficence,education and hospitality (in its true sense) of the entire community."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Traditionally, one is to give something up or take something on as a Lenten discipline. I did the latter, albeit inadvertently. Around Ash Wednesday of 1998, I began Darmaid MacCulloch's magisterial biography of Thomas Cranmer (Yale University Press 1996). I finished this magnificent tome on Holy Saturday. As the time passed, I came to realize that this Lent was for me a time to study a key figure in the Church and compare his often--to modern Episcopalians-- unorthodox theology against what I have come to believe.Thomas Cranmer is a pillar of Episcopal history (and hagiography). One literally cannot participate in a Sunday service without reciting or hearing his words. In 1549, he compiled the first Book of Common Prayer. Many of the collects we say are either his original compositions or alterations upon existing texts. MacCulloch says of the Collects:There is little doubt we owe him [Cranmer] the present form of the sequence of eighty-four seasonal collects and a dozen or so further examples embedded elsewhere in the 1549 services: no doubt either that these jewelled miniatures are one of the chief glories of the Anglican liturgical tradition, a particularly distinguished development of the genre of brief prayer which is peculiar to the Western Church. Their concise expression has not always won unqualified praise, especially from those who consider that God enjoys extended addresses from his creatures; but they have proved one of the most enduring vehicles of worship in the Anglican communion.To me, today, the Collects focus and gather the scripture for each service.Cranmer's beliefs were distinct, certain, and in some respects quite different from what I had thought. He was a strong predestinarian, and for this reason felt that &quot;good works&quot; had no effect upon where a soul went after death. He viewed the Pope as the Antichrist, and profoundly believed that the Ruler of England was the Head of the Church. (This led to his profound spiritual disorientation and crisis when the Catholic Mary succeed Edward VI; suddenly the person whom he viewed as Head of the Church was allied with evil personified).Cranmer was decidedly &quot;low church&quot; in his beliefs and liturgy. The Eucharist, for him, was purely a memorial, and the bread and wine were not the true Christ. In his view, Christ was sacrificed once only at Golgotha; to say that each Eucharist was a new sacrifice was for him anathema. (A vestige of Cranmer's clear belief survives in the language of the Rite One Eucharist--&quot;one oblation of himself once offered.&quot;) During his time, he had rood screens and images removed from churches, removed many saints' and holy days from the Church calendar, moved altars away from the church wall and toward the worshipers (this, at least, agrees with our modern theology), and changed the language of worship to English.What made the Cranmer biography a Lenten discipline, and not just leisure reading, was for me to see again how literally every rite, word and image in our service comes from serious theological reflection and humankind's continuing effort, sometimes stumblingly, to find and reflect God's will in worship. I do not agree with Cranmer's view on predestination, although I certainly understand the sincerity with which it was held, and the struggles which brought him there. I have always found the Eucharistic language &quot;one oblation of himself once offered&quot; terribly stilted and prosaic; I now understand that Cranmer and subsequent Prayer Book compilers said exactly what they meant to say. (One of the great gifts of the &quot;big tent&quot; of Episcopalianism is that all of us --both those who view the Eucharist as memorial only and those who see the true body and blood transformed--may worship at the same table). While and since reading this fine biography, I find myself approaching almost everything we say and do in worship in a different, more reflective, posture. Next year for Lent I perhaps will give up chocolate. (I have tried this in other years, never making it as far as Refreshment Sunday.) Reflective Christians, however, who do not mind serious scholarship (this is not light reading) conveyed through lively prose could do worse than to take up this life and biography of Archbishop Cranmer."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"MacCulloch has penned a prodigious and comprehensive biography of Thomas Cranmer. Serious questions about the development of his thought, theology and ecclesiology are given special attention. These are cast in relations to the contemporary political (local and international) situtations to better enable a reader to understand the man, his times and his influence. Given the stages over which the Henrician and Edwardian church reformations progressed, understanding Cranmer's central and guiding actions seems to be MacCulloch strongest sections. Emphasis, then, on Cranmer's central work in life is properly and comprehensively treated, without being severely colored by all that has been penned about his final days. Nevertheless, MacCulloch has done a convincing job of helping one to see Cranmer's sincerity of reform purposes, his pragmatic concerns about the pace of change, his understanding of the needs of commonfolk (as opposed to the middle and upper classes), his fierce opposition to established orders (friers and, later, radicals [nonconformists]). Especially instuctive is the secion on Cranmer's Prayer Book writing purpose, style and method, his borrowings, his innovations, and his synthses. For a 600 page, book, I found it a thoroughly compelling reading experience from first to last (about 6 days)."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"I took \\"Thomas Cranmer\\" on in order to make sense of a seeming paradox: What I already \\"knew\\" of him did not square with the theology I had begun to discover in his Collects and Prayer Book. I was curious!MacCulloch does a masterful job at presenting this complex, and sometimes contradictory figure of the early English Reformation. Despite the derrogatory review given by \\"a reader,\\" I found very little bias and no axe-grinding in this work. Actually, I came to the book expecting some bias. Even being thusly prepared and properly skeptical, I found only a very few times that MacCulloch let his own opinions show through. (When he does, it is in parentheses with exclamation points!!) You can almost hear him chuckle at times.I read the book in 9 or 10 days, and never found it to be a chore; in fact, the most difficult thing was putting it down and going to bed! While the book is scholarly, and masterfully written, it is definitely not tedious or boring.I came to the end of the book with a deep respect for Cranmer. I have many points of disagreement with him, and yet a certain admiration for his eventual willingness to heroically stand where he believed the Gospel compelled him to stand. Fr. James DeKoven, an early Anglican theological hero in Wisconsin, once said \\"We live at a time when cowardice in matters of religion has been elevated to the status of virtue.\\" Archbishop Thomas Cranmer proved, in the end, to be anything but a coward.I have corresponded several times now with Professor MacCulloch, and find him to be humble, dedicated, and helpful. I am now reading his \\"The Reformation: a history,\\" and I plan to read everything else of his that I can get my hands on!"},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Many Anglican history books have an axe to grind. But not this masterful biography. The Thomas Cranmer of MacCulloch is very human, but no villian nor an unblemished hero.We see his theological evolution from a fairly orthodox Catholic to a stauch Protestant who went to the stake in defiance of Bloody Mary and the \\"Antichrist\\" Pope.MacCulloch also takes the reader into the historical sources and their reliability. These, along with his extensive footnotes will be of interest to any serious student of Anglican history.Yet this longish book is very readable and rarely gets bogged down, again unlike some other Anglican histories.If you want to learn about Thomas Cranmer or about early Anglicanism, this book is a must read.Mark Marshall is the author of God Knows What It's Like to be a Teenager."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Exquisely researched and engagingly written, Diarmaid MacCulloch brought to life a figure who played a substantial role in both English and church history during the Reformation, and whose legacy lives on. I feel that for the first time in more than 30 years of bumping into Henry VIII's Archbishop of Canterbury, and of regularly using the Book of Common Prayer that he master-minded, I have properly met the man. MacCulloch obviously adores Cranmer, but is not blind to his shortcomings. He also shows the cost to Cranmer of bringing about fundamental change in the English Church -- ultimately losing his life. I came away from the book marveling at the richness and stature of the Anglican way of believing, and the part Cranmer played in making it happen. I have been heralding it from the housetops! Like all good books, I was sorry when it ended."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"MacCulloch's book provides access to the singularly foundational figure of the reformation in England. Most who recognize Cranmer's name at all know him only as the author of the first Prayer Book or the man who attained Henry VIII's annulment from Catherine. MacCullogh gives depth to Cranmer as a flawed yet faithful agent of the Church, one who sought with conviction the reformation of the Church of England but was also willing to slavishly follow his prince in order to achieve that reformation. The final chapter, chronicling Cranmer's fall and ultimate martyrdom, reads with the pace of a good novel. For Episcopalians and others with an affinity for the Anglican tradition, insight into Cranmer's life and thought is crucial, and MacCulloch presents that insight with skill."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"I am not much of a biography/history reader, but I was forced to read this hefty volume for a research paper on Cranmer (took me all of nine days, reading for several hours a day). This is quality, scholarly research, well-written and keeping a good balance between describing the events of Cranmer's life and career, and analysing his theological development. MacCulloch writes favourably about Cranmer, and his account is bound to inspire sympathy and admiration for someone who was a flawed hero, but a hero nevertheless."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"In an age of badly researched, &quot;quickie&quot; biographies, it is refreshing to read one by an author who does his homework with an almost maniacal intensity yet never loses the thread of the narrative or the sense of what might matter to the general reader.This is an excellent book, and it gives a particularly strong insight into the complex personality of Henry VIII, to often portrayed as a one dimensional, lecherous caricature of a monarch. The author demands at least a nodding familiarity with Tudor England, but this is still a marvellous read for anyone interested in the origins of English Protestantism."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"This work gives the reader an excellent historical account not only of the life of Cranmer, but of the chaotic situation in Tudoe England during the Reformation. Cranmer's extraordinary ability to develop a new and moving liturgy with a basis in history yet more moving and compassionate than ever in such a political climate is a miracle in itself."},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer, A Life (winner of the 1996 Whitebeard Biography award)","review":"Oxford professor Diamaid MacCulloch presents the riveting biography of the Church of England's founder with \\"Thomas Cranmer: A Life\\" (1996, 704 page paperback). This classic is well researched (with a 26 pages bibliography and dozens of museum artifacts photos). MacCulloch is the current generation's latest word on the life, ministry, history, and legacy of Henry VIII's greatest Archbishop. All student of Thomas Cranmer will find this book a must read.MacCulloch goes to some length to present Cranmer's story. Readers discover the Archbishop's pre royal service college and university days. One learns that 1531 was the pivotal year in Thomas' maturing theology. Cranmer's gradual move from Roman Catholicism towards Lutheranism ending in royal rule of the church is carefully analyzed. The reader meets each of Henry's wives, children, courtesans, liaisons and their access into the Archbishop's life. Wolsey, Tyndale, Cromwell, Latimer, Gardiner, Ridley, Fisher, and many more are thoroughly discussed in relation to Cranmer. Each Parliament's actions for the king's will, with the Archbishop's blessing, are presented. MacCulloch intends to answer as many questions as possible about the life of Thomas Cranmer.Cranmer annulled Henry's marriages, granted royal divorces, assented to queens' beheading, arranged royal marriages, and baptized newborn prince and princesses. He represented the kings at foreign courts, before parliaments, and before the general populace of medieval England. His fertile theological mind worked diligently to separate Christianity in England from the Roman curia. Cranmer wrote tracts, books, and sermons on the subject of royal supremacy of the church. He invented the beloved \\"Book of Common Prayer\\" of 1549 and its first revision of 1552. With king Edward VI's blessing Cranmer founded the Church of England. In the end Cranmer found martyrdom on Queen Mary's chopping block.Cranmer's professional and personal trials and tribulations are reviewed. One learns of his family history, his marriage to Margaret of Nuremberg, his short family legacy (his son and daughter did not carry his family line), and the whereabouts of his vast library after his 1556 death. In deed, MacCulloch ranks (page 618) Cranmer among history's reluctant martyrs: theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Archbishops Luwum and Romero (this list should also include Becket, Joan of Arch, and Tyndale).MacCulloch's analysis is punctual and thorough. Even though the length of this book may require some commitment for many readers, it is well worth the effort. MacCulloch writing style is inviting and absorbing. One comes to know Cranmer better, almost personally. \\"Thomas Cranmer\\" is recommended to everyone with an interest in the C of E, Cranmer, Henry VIII, the pre Elizabethan Tudor era, and English history.Happy Aldersgate Day!"},{"Title":"The Stalking Moon","review":"A good story with a different plot.

I find the characters pretty flat and Anne is, in my opinion, actually a little annoying. Worse than that, how believable is it that every man in the story from the semi-misogynistic boat captain to the King himself is so enamored with her? I mean, really. It's one thing to have a likeable heroine, it's quite another to have a goddess in a servant's body. If one more man declared her intriguing or alluring, I was going to chuck my Kindle out the window.None of the characters had much personality, really. They were all cookie-cutter.And yet...I read it. Aside from the irritation that was Ms. Perfect Anne, I read it and sort of enjoyed it. It's far from intellectually challenging, but it kept me reading anyway. I don't know how. I'm really at a loss on this one, because I did read it all the way through, so it couldn't have been too bad, but I wouldn't say it's a good book either."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is a work of romantic historical fiction that takes place in fifteenth century England. A young, barely conscious, and very pregnant gentlewoman is fleeing through the forest with another gentle woman. It all proves too much for the pregnant woman and she dies in the forest, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. The child is left with Deborah, a wise woman and healer who lives in the forest. Named Anne, the child is taught to read and write Latin and do sums by a local priest, while Deborah teaches her domestic skills.When Anne is nearly fifteen, she is placed into service in the household of a wealth London merchant, Matthew Cuttifer, to attend his wife, the Lady Margaret. It is the Cuttifer household that Anne's fame as a skillful herbalist and healer take hold. When The King, himself, Edward IV, hears of Anne's skills, she is summoned to his castle to assist the Queen through the rigors of childbirth. It is through her service in his household that the King takes note of Anne's charms.Before Anne knows it, she finds herself permanently ensconced in the palace. It is there that she awakens to love, as Edward IV has more than a platonic interest in her. It is also there that she discovers her true origins. This knowledge changes her life and conflicts her, as events occur that take on new meaning in the context of her new found knowledge. Fleeing her old life with all of its intrigues and dangers, she hopes to start a new one.This is an interesting, fairly well-written work of romantic historical fiction that is steeped in period detail. It is the first in a trilogy of books. I enjoyed it and expect that I will be reading the remainder of the trilogy."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is a Romance Novel with a thin backdrop of a very diluted 15th century England where Edward the IV is king.Anne, a young peasant girl, comes to London where she is able to...leap tall buildings in a single bound...not exactly but pretty close.Anne is amazingly skilled with herbs and is able to apply her skills where no one else can. She assists in the healing of her employer and then goes on to offer her aid to the queen.There are so many logic defying turns in this story that by the end I really couldn't wait for it to be done. It was as if the entire story was contrived for the sole purpose of bringing us to the conclusion of this book.There was a lot of sex, I don't mind sex in my fiction as long as it's believable and tastefully done. But this sex wasn't believable for these characters. I don't fault the writer for including the rape scene and the abuse at the hands of the masochistic pervert. I thought that part of the story actually gave the book some drama and tension but it was resolved very quickly and somewhat simply and then that story line was finished.The relationships between the characters do not ring true, the events that unfold do not ring true. The characters reactions to events are contrived. Deborah who has known Anne's heritage all along suddenly wants to bow to her now that her parentage has been revealed to the reader? It doesn't make any sense. And the woman who was present for Anne's birth forgot about her? Again I didn't find it believable and there's more I didn't find believable but I can say exactly what without revealing too much of what happens. There is a mystical theme that felt forced and underdeveloped, it just wasn't well done.The characters are flat and suffer from 'flip-flop' where they contemplate a situation, make a decision to do one thing and then actually do the complete opposite which usually involves sex. I never felt that Anne did anything because she actually wanted to, it felt like she did it because Posie Graeme-Evans made her do it.The story itself falls flat from beginning to end. There are just too many things that don't make any sense. I will say that some of the details were done well, the lice and the smells and sounds of London.If you don't mind logic and common sense lacking in the books you read you might just like this story. If you really just like a lot of sex in your fiction pick this one up.If you are a critical reader I would suggest you keep looking for your next favorite book, you might want to try Sharon Kay Penman's 'Sunne In Splendour' which is so well done."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Posie Graeme Evans has written an excellent historical romance set in the turbulent period of the War of the Roses during the 15th century. The houses of York and Lancaster vie for supremacy and the throne of England is the backdrop for the novel.The heroine Anne will face a number of trials and tribulations before the novel ends. She will go from servant girl to noblewoman and fall in love with a man she can never marry.The book is generally well written, however, to me the biggest flaw is the character of Anne herself. It is hard to believe that someone who thinks she is a peasant serving woman transforms into a highly confident and astute noblewoman within a few short pages. You know from the start with the discription of her birth that this is no ordinary child. By the time she reaches London with her foster mother she can read and write English, French and Latin. Additionally, she is schooled in the preparation drugs and nedicines of the times. Considering the treatment of women during the Middle Ages this is remarkable.Despite its flaws those who love romantic fiction will enjoy this book.

This book captures the essence of it's era and as the storyline unfolds it evokes a sense of realism, suspense and romance. The ideas on which the author does touch do not solely apply to the mid fourteen hundreds but have been embedded throughout history and continue to exist today- whether it be the familial unrest, domestic abuse, suicide, societal status or forbidden love. Posie Graeme-Evans effectively communicates her story and should be commended for such as achievement."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"15 year old Anne is being taken by her foster mother to work as a servant in merchant's house. She has good knowledge of herbs and after Anne saves the merchant's wife, her knowledge brings her to the attention of the court's doctor.The doctor brings Anne to court to help the queen giving birth to their first child. While being there she attracts the king's eye and discovers the truth about her parents.Oh boy, where am I gonna start? First of all, if you're gonna read this for historical accurancy, don't bother.My first problem is with Anne. She is just too perfect. Every man falls for her, even the king who is known for his many fleeting affairs just falls in love with after few glances. Of course she can heal better than the doctors, evade the merchant's son who loves to spend his time raping the servant girls, staying annoyingly innocent and being nice to everyone.In the beginning of the book the merchan't son, Piers, has some rather gross sex scenes with this girl which I could have lived unknowing. And we also learn that Edward IV finds watching other people having sex erotic and appearantly so does Anne after peeking from the door where Hastings is with some laundress *insert eye roll here*And the truth about her parents? Her father is none other than Henry VI. Because he's known to be chasing girls between praying and his bouts of madness... And it's rather understandable that after Margaret finds out the girl is pregnant she tries to assasinate her. This whole thing was little too much on the melodramatic side for my liking.And after Anne finds out about her father, she rather instantly finds maturity and kind of a royal bearing. And after months of evading Edward she jumps to his bed after finding who she is. Because it's much more logical doing adultery when you are royal bastard than a mere servant...And why illegitimate daughter might be such a big threat to Edward is totally beyond me.But I liked William Hastings.

Desperately want to know what happens next!"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"A bodice-ripper with a young, innocent girl as its heroine, The Innocent follows the story of Anne, a peasant girl. The prologue of the book narrates the bizarre circumstances of her birth; the reader isn't told who wants her young mother killed, or why straight off. Anne lives in the forest with her foster mother Deborah, learning the art of herbal medicine. There's a bit of religion involved- not only traditional Christianity, but pagan rituals as well.At the age of 15 she goes to the manor house of Sir Matthew Cuttifer to become a body servant to his wife. A series of unfortunate circumstances leads to the death of a servant girl who works with Anne. Hearing of the wonders she performs, the Queen has Anne come to court, where she catches the eye of King Edward IV. The book is all about lust, and how Anne tries to suppress her lust for the king. And, like a harlequin romance novel, the female characters in this book are extremely shallow and empty-headed; Anne never seems to be able to think for herself. One would think that, escaping the lustful attention of Matthew Cuttifer's son, Anne would be able to resist temptation by not having sex with the king.While the book could have had less sex and death in it (most of it disturbing accounts of rape and kinky sex), it is still very well written, with a lot of detail, especially with regards to clothing and hair. I'm a huge fan of English history, especially medieval history; this book was quite a pleasure to read and much less taxing on the brain than other, denser historical novels. Its good for the beach or an airplane ride."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"this book is fun to read but the first part of the book when she is working in the merchants house is a five star read while the second half just doesnt measure up. but i would still strongly recommend reading this book and i plan to read the authors new soon to be released book as well"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"\\"The Innocent\\" is just OK. As a reader who devours historical fiction, particularly that which is set in medieval England, I was slightly disappointed with this book. It just didn't hold my interest the way others have - for instance, Sharon Kay Penman's the Sunne in Splendour, Here Be Dragons, Falls the Shadow and the Reckoning. It's not the romance - I rather appreciate a good romantic story within this genre of book. It just was slightly too fantastical and wasn't developed quite enough. And Anne, the main character, is a whiz-bang with \\"simples\\" and herbal remedies - as are all heroines in mediocre medieval novels. It just wasn't quite original or developed enough. Maybe a bit like a Judy Garwood romance, but not as good as Diana Gabaldon... again, fine filler reading while waiting for Emma Donoghue or Michael Faber to release more of the stuff I really love.Regardless, it is summer so I will start reading the next one tonight, & will likely read the third when it is released."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Where do I start with this book? Well, recently I've had a problem with not finding a book that can hold my interest. I think I went through about four or five books before I found this little gem. It not only held my interest, but I was so hooked that I read it in two days. I even put down the other book that I was reading to read Posie Graeme-Evans' The Innocent. I wouldn't say the book is amazing, but it definitely caught my attention.The Innocent follows the life of the mysterious Anne. She was born in the forests of England in the 1450s in the midst of a bloody civil war. Fifteen years later she enters the house of Sir Matthew to work as a servant for his wife, Lady Margaret. It isn't long, however, until Anne is pulled into the politics and escapades of the household and is forced down the path to adulthood.After Anne uses her knowledge of herbs to help Lady Margaret, word spreads to King Edward IV, and she is brought to his household to help the queen through the labors of childbirth. It isn't long, of course, until the king takes special notice of Anne and sets out to take her innocence.Even though this book does take a little while to pick up steam, when it does -it's pretty steamy. I was a little surprised by the inclusion of so many sexual comments and scenes because it didn't really seem like what I signed up for after reading the back -but at least most of them seemed to serve a purpose (if slightly overdone). The story particularly picked up in the final third of the book when the focus shifted from romance to political intrigue. I've always been a bigger fan of that than romance, so I was on the edge of my seat when it finally happened.The real star of this novel, however, was the pure, effortless skill woven into Graeme-Evans' prose. It was very easy to read, had short, manageable chapters and details so vivid I could see everything. I was particularly amazed by the writing in this book. Even though the plot and characters weren't amazing, Graeme-Evans is able to convey crystal-clear scenes with astonishing details (this woman definitely did her research!) and just enough words to get the point across without taking away from the plot.However, there are a few small issues that keep this novel from being great. First, some of the characters become a little inconsistent in personality throughout the novel and tend to be a little flat -of course, this isn't too noticeable, but would definitely help strengthen the novel. It also seems like it takes a long time to get to the plot that was originally advertised with the book, so I felt a little bit like I had to wade through too much before I got to what I was expecting.Overall, The Innocent is an enjoyable, though improbable, historical romance novel that is something of a cross between Ken Follett Pillars of the Earth and Philippa Gregory's Tudor Court novels set in the 15th century. It'll appeal to history lovers and readers who appreciate good world building and intricate detail. An enjoyable and fun read that'll keep you going and leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Entertaining enough, the historical period was obviously well reseached, however, it was written with simple and often repetitve language.

The main character, Anne, is likable enough but again far fetched. The things that she does in the book just wouldn't have happened. It bordered on a fantasy novel.All in all, it was OK. Just OK."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is a lackluster bodice-ripper (literally, in at least two instances) with a heroine who's a confusing (and unconvincing) combination of lust and piety. The 15th-century familial saga of the usurping Yorkists is the flat backdrop to a conventional tale of a virtuous and lovely young serving-woman who discovers -- shockingly! -- that she is really of noble birth. But how will this affect her sex life? Many loving descriptions of velvet gowns and some brief graphic coupling."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Before I even start I will say that this is heavy on the fiction side. You read minimal about the big events that happened and mainly about the love story of Edward and Anne. That is okay, it was a decent story. A little tough to get into it but after the first few chapters the story unraveled rather well.Anne's knowledge of healing herbs brings her to the attention of Queen Elizabeth. Dame Jehanne is in charge of the queen's body servants. Jehanne does not know at this time that Anne is the child that she helped bring into this world (won't spoil who Anne's parents are for you). Queen Elizabeth is portrayed as a cold and mean woman to her servants (first time that I have read a description about her that is unfavorable) but very devoted and loving to her husband. King Edward finds himself in love with Anne but after Anne finds out who her parents were she knows that it can never be. But of course, eventually she gives in but then has to flee for her own safety. Edward and Anne's relationship is like an yo-yo. I did get wrapped up in it wondering when they would finally give in to temptation. So many times it was SO close! The ending leaves it wide open for the next book and I won't give away the reason why...:)Nothing too exciting in this book but is a good story. Book is not a keeper on my historical fiction shelf but I will read the next one."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Posie Graeme-Evans has an incredible talent for blending a little bit of fiction with a large of amount of researched history to create spell- binding historical novels. The Innocent is the first of a trilogy (includes The Exiled and The Uncrowned Queen). These books allow today's readers to understand the many intricacies and nuances of past royal families. Women of noble birth were mercilessly groomed to \\"catch the eye\\" of the King, in order to benefit the family through the relationship, be it as eventual queen or as favorite mistress. However, in the blink of an eye, those fortunes could change - as could the fortunes of any King, who was constantly challenged to retain his kindomship. In The Innocent, the lady in question possesses a talent for herbal healing and as a result, finds the love of her life. All three of the books are intriguing, revelatory and just plain downright fun to read!"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"The Innocent is the first in the Anne trilogy by Aussie author Posie Graeme-Evans. We are first introduced to Anne as a body servant to a wealthy English merchant's wife. Using her doctoring and knowledge of herbs, Anne soon finds herself in the Kings houshold attending Queen Elisabeth. Through a series of intrigues she begins a torrid affair with King Edward and soon discovers the secret surrounding her birth.This book had a very powerful opening that hooked me in from the start. Graeme-Evans has crafted a compelling narrative arc that keeps you turning pages in this non-traditional Cinderella story. I genuinley felt for the young protagonist as she tried to fit in to a completely foreign court life. Through the pages of this book, Anne really is stripped of her innocence.Graeme-Evans is a beautiful writer who is naturally gifted with the art of description withouth over-indulging in it. She also isn't afraid to get her hands dirty. She is crass when she needs to be and doesn't shy away from describing the less delicate aspects of life in the 1400's. I must admit that I love all these gritty details and although at times I found myself cringing, it really adds to the authenticity. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't phased by the S&M; sex scenes too much although I can see that some may find them offensive.If it didn't end on such a cliff-hanger, I'd recommend reading this book without the following two. It really is an enjoyable read however I felt that Graeme-Evans failed to maintain the character of Anne through the next two novels.http://readingwritingranting.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Awesome book! I can't wait to read the rest of the series! The imagery and the beautiful writing make this a very engaging story!"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is a pretty easy read- I finished it in 1/2 a day. I like how the author writes; it is really descriptive and has more substanance in it than your basic romance novel. Overall, it is a very good story, with a little surprise at the end. However, be forewarned, that there are over-the-top sex descriptions throughout, some a little unnecessary, crude and horny, and within the first 60 pages, there are many accounts of rape and violence towards women that was too unsettling for me to read, so I just skipped over those pages. By reading this book you would think that people had no self control over their sexual urges and it is acceptable for them to have sex with whoever was in their sight."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"What a deal! I found this book on a super clearance sale table. I started reading it and I couldn't put it down! It has mystery, passion, excitement, and is wonderfully written. I was turning the pages so quickly that when I got to the end and realized there was another book I just couldn't wait to get the next one. I passed the book onto a friend and she called me and asked what took me so long to pass it along because it was so good, but distracting, you just can't wait to pick it up and keep reading."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"I thought this was a fun entertaining read. Though this is not a romance novel, the author's beautiful prose makes it read like one. Yes, it has elements of romance but the love story was pretty much a backdrop to the heroine's story, IMO.Set during the War of the Roses, this is a fun, fascinating tale of the life of a woman with a secret past that even she doesn't know about. The opening scene of a pregnant woman in labor being chased through the forest by mysterious soldiers bent on killing her sets the tone for this fantastic, witty, and engrossing tale. By the end I was eagerly awaiting the sequel! If you enjoy romantic historical's and want a fun, light, but engrossing tale, then this book's for you."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"The Innocent is the first of a trilogy based on a fictitious lover of King Edward IV. The writing is not stellar and the sex scenes, while riveting, tended to embarrass me. All the same I read this and the subsequent two books in the series with great zeal and enjoyment and I was sorry when the last book drew to a close. We become fond of the characters in Posie Graeme-Evans trilogy and it's sad to say goodbye to them even though their speech, thought patterns and beliefs do not accurately reveal those of people in their position during the Medieval Period. Because of the quality of the writing I cannot imagine rereading them at a future date as I have with books whose presentation is more artistic and possesses more veracity. All the same, while I wouldn't recommend them to friends because it is hard to know a person's tolerance for mediocre writing, I wouldn't tell them NOT to read them either. Of the three The Innocent is the most poorly written but it's worth struggling through to become intimate with the characters that are better developed and more believable in the next two books. I gave it four stars because I fell so in love with Anne, King Edward IV, Deborah, Medieval London and Bruges and the author successfully allowed me to inhabit their lives."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF A TRILOGY.

I loved this book and cant wait to read the sequel. I stayed awake into the wee hours to finish it-couldn't stop reading. A wonderful storyline and accurate period details made for a great read. There was just enoughhistorical fact to keep the story real for me."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"My primary reading choices for the past two years have been in the romance genre--historical romance in particular--and I picked this book up not because I assumed it was a historical romantic novel, but because I am a fan of well written historical fiction. The romance between Anne and Edward was an added bonus to an already intriguing novel. Most likely because I have a background in the romance genre, I found the sex and the romance not distasteful, in fact finding that it drew a defter hand in concern to the characters and their motivations. And for those who complain that \\"The Innocent\\" reads like a \\"romance\\" novel, not so, nearly everything that occured in this novel, even down to the detail to the history, is not something commonly found in the historical romance genre if I may be truthful. I recommend this novel to anyone with a love for history, a female protagonist strong for her times, and a warm love story that heightens the tension of the plot. I look forward to reading the second novel."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is a truly sensational read that will transport the reader into the high drama of Edward 1V's 15th century England as seen through the eyes of Anne, a young, beautiful peasant girl.Anne survives and flourishes despite powerful political forces who killed her mother. At fifteen, she travels to London and finds work for a wealthy merchant. Word spreads of her remarkable talents with healing and medicines. She is summoned to the palace to attend the fragile young queen. In this lonely and unfamiliar world of the palace the stirringly erotic and powerful journey swings into high gear and Anne finds herself entangled in a passionate love affair with Edward, the king.The Innocent has it all! Definitely one for the shelves at home. The author's research into the 15th century is authoritative and convincing. This book certianly leaves you craving for the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"The great thing about this book is that you smell the smells (and there are plenty of them, not all pleasant), hear the sounds, taste the food (not always so great), and experience the sensations (biting cold, strange clothing, vermin)of a period far removed from our own.Posie Graeme-Evans is obviously obsessed with the minutiae of the period her heroine inhabits. She loves the houses and the countryside. She loves the stuff of Royalty and greatness. She loves the detail of the food and the sanitary arrangements. But above all she knows how to put it all together and tell a good story. This book rocks along. It's no Georgette Heyer shrinking violet. Here be throughly ripped bodices, here be wham-bam sexual mores, here be bloody intrigue and murder. And here be nailbiting jeopardy aplenty for a heroine with a considerable journey awaiting. I hear there are two more Anne books to come. Bring them on Posie! (What a great name for a writer of this genre!!!)"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Be aware! Spoilers are marked!After many years of delving into Tudor history, I've recently been exploring the years during the Wars of the Roses. I find the advent to the Throne of the House of York quite fascinating. These were tumultous years, when indeed a \\"nobody\\" whose only claim to the throne came from a tenuous, illegitimate Plantagenet connection, could found a dynasty and become grandsire to one of Britain's greatest monarchs.Unfortunately, we are all aware that it has recently become the fashion to use this fascinating history as mere backdrop for blazing bodice-rippers which have a closer connection to \\"Sweet Savage Love\\" than to anything written by Alison Weir. Without the psychological verisimilitude of SSL, that is.I can understand a well-written historical novel which chooses to speculate about the lives of characters during that era - creating characters, creating theoretical romances, etc. And while I am not a big fan of the titillating sex scenes, they don't necessarily have to put me off.Here are some of what I consider the main problems of this book which I can describe without spoilers:1. The book gives absolutely NO \\"scaffolding,\\" so to speak, to the so-called \\"true love\\" between Edward VI and Anne (the protagonist). Their relationship, for most of the book, consists of a few soulful looks and some breast grabbing. Rather, the content of the book made ME more aware of what a good match Elizabeth Wydville was for Edward. Both were strategists and both had been around the block a few times. How could Edward find a soul-mate in an untried, innocent teenage girl? Edward was, in the words once used to describe a former President of the United States, \\"a hard dog to keep on the porch.\\" Why would a so-called sensible girl think that, of all the comely young maidens in the land, SHE was the king's truest love?2. The characters were two dimensional. How disappointing to be able to predict what would happen to whom. And the entire role of the doctor in the book was very confusing. Supposedly he was a bad person who deserved to be punished, but for what? Sure, he pandered a bit to the king. So did they all. And his medicine was more dangerous than helpful. Also typical of the time.3. The \\"love scenes\\"(read \\"sex scenes\\")don't read as true. In my eyes, they all seemed to start when he'd grab her and pull her into a bedroom, molest her a bit, then he'd get distracted and she'd escape. Even at the conclusion of the book, when she supposedly has a \\"reason\\" to deny Edward, her feelings of loyalty to someone who was a complete stranger to her seem misplaced. And after all this, when she does make her final decisions about what to do with herself and with Edward, her decision is thrown off with a quick and inexplicable phrase.4. Not only are the characters shallow in and of themselves, but they are anachronistic. They make decisions based upon 21st century reasoning. True 15th century Britons would find this book very perplexing.5. I personally did not find the \\"historical\\" details so well researched. I myself could create a better ambiance set in the 15th century off the top of my head.If you wish to read an exciting, titillating book in which a young woman finds love at first sight and discovers a secret which gives her the power to challenge kings as their equal, you may enjoy this book. If you think that reading about characters who are \\"just like you\\" but live in the past makes good historical fiction, this book is probably for you.***SPOILERS NOW***In my opinion, the main premise of this book, which is that a young woman finds \\"true love\\" with Edward IV (and this deep understanding of each other comes from a few soulful glances while she serves his wife) but must give up this love because the secret of her birth has been exposed. The secret? That she is the \\"love-child\\" of Henry VI and one of his wife's waiting women.(During this period of the Wars of the Roses, there were two anointed Kings who battled for the throne: Henry VI who lost the throne and Edward IV who was the son of the Duke of York and who won the crown in battle.)Graeme-Evans reveals this secret to us as a deus ex machina so that Anne will be forced to deny her love with Edward and go into exile. Why must she go into exile, you wonder? After all, not only is she illegitimate and a woman, but even the proof she has as to her identity and birth are flimsy and basically depend upon the word of two women, one lowborn.Well, according to Graeme-Evans, this dubious ancestry puts her teenage protagonist on a par with Edward IV and any other ruling monarch! As soon as Anne and her cohorts become aware of her birth, an aura of regal bearing envelops this callow girl so that she is endowed with the inborn power to make Dukes cower and a reigning, anointed king to view her as his equal. So much his equal, that in order for him to keep his throne, her existence is a threat which must be diminished one way or another.Now isn't it funny that a few short years later the children of Edward IV and Elizabeth Wydville are disqualified from ruling because his pre-contract with Eleanor Butler taints them with illegitimacy? It was very common for kings to keep their illegitimate children within the family structure, ennobling them and ensuring their futures; while these children were never seen as serious heirs to the throne.And the British were very opposed to the idea of a Queen Regnant. They had had some unpleasant experiences with Queen Isabella and Queen Marguerite (Henry VIs wife), thank you very much.In addition to this, in order to gain the throne, it was basically necessary to raise an army and champion them to victory. NOT skills taught to a young girl raised in a forest by a \\"wise woman.\\" It's hard enough to think of Anne de Bohun speaking to Edward IV as an equal while looking in his face - but as Joan of Arc? Not likely.I find the reviews written by people who said that they \\"learned a great deal about history from reading this book\\" very sad."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"I am an avid historical fiction reader, so I knew that I would eventually read this book. Started out a little slow for me, but couldn't put it down after the first 100 or so pages. Characters were a little stereotypical - innocent orphan with a secret past; manipulative/conniving son of a rich merchant; soft-spoken, loving merchant's wife and the typical over-the-top courtiers and royalty. I do not consider myself to be prudish, but the graphic, S&M-type sex scenes in the beginning bordered on porn and I kept wondering why such a graphic approach was so necessary - may be offensive to some readers. Some of the text/words seemed inappropriate for the times (the constant referral to the lovers being \\"hot\\" or thinking another person to be \\"hot\\" annoyed me). Overall, I definitely enjoyed the book and recommend it. I may even attempt the sequel (it's a trilogy), but can't say that I'm rushing out to locate one."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This is one beautiful novel! Set in Medieval times, fifteenth century England, The Innocent tells the story of young Anne. Having survived an attempted murder when she was newborn, Anne is a peasant girl who works for English aristocrats. Anne is a beautiful young woman who would have had a much more difficult time in her workplace had it not been for her special abilities as a healer. Her gifts take her as far as looking after the queen. And then Anne meets King Edward IV. She moves into the palace to work for the royals -- where an intense, bittersweet affair with the king begins. There are various twists throughout the novel.I loved the language of this novel. The backdrop of the struggles the royals had in Britain is fascinating and the storytelling is lyrical and beautiful. The story of Anne touched me in many levels. I couldn't keep the book down as she endured all sorts of obstacles and succumbed to her passionate love affair with King Edward IV. The historical references are marvelous and the secondary characters, though in some cases underdeveloped, are compelling. Some readers have complained that this novel reads like a historical romance. There is a romantic subplot centered on Anne and Edward, but there are so many other elements to this novel. You only have to read the synopsis to know that there is some romance in the novel. It is too bad that the aforementioned aspect of literature isn't everyone's cup of tea. I like some romance in literature. Anyway, The Innocent is one of the best reading investments I've made this summer. I recommend this novel most highly and I can't wait to pick up The Exile."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"I picked up this book on a recommendation from a fellow book publisher, and I couldn't put it down. Not only is the writing phenomenal (I had to delve into my bedside dictionary on numerous occasions), but the plot positively bursts with secret affairs, court politics, and and vivid descriptions of fifteenth century London.The story is bold, sexy, and vibrant; one of the best I've read in quite a while.My only critcism would be that the characters are a bit larger-than-life and therefore difficult to relate to. Many of them seem overly one-dimensional: Elizabeth is superficial and ridiculously high-maintenance, Piers is a horrific cad, and Margaret is always dignified and composed. We never see a variation in their behavior, and the same could almost be said of wholesome Anne and playboy Edward.I've just begun the sequel, and I'm hoping to see new sides of the characters, and a bit more raw emotion.Bottom-line: if you enjoy intelligent historical writing and tales of forbidden love, this book is a must!!"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"In 1450, no place in England can be considered safe as the War of the Roses soaks the country in a bloody conflict. A group of soldiers are attacked in a forest. One of the escorted females Jehanne helps a pregnant woman obtain relative safety. However, the woman dies giving birth to Anne. Out of no where, Deborah appears to escort Jehanne and Anne to a haven. Over the next fifteen years Deborah raises Anne like she is her own daughter within the sanctuary of the forest. The youngster learns about herbs and healing while living a pleasant peasant life.After a scything, Deborah takes Anne to London where her radiant holy-like smile obtains her a servant's job in the household of Mathew Cutifer. Not long afterward, word spreads through the streets of the city about this extraordinary healer living in the Cutifer household. When her skill saves the life of the queen, King Edward IV moves her into his place as a royal healer. However, Edward and Anne fall in love, but both know nothing beyond clandestine trysts can happen between them because his monarchy remains shaky though the civil war is over and he cannot afford a scandal.THE INNOCENT is a magnificent medieval love story starring a fabulous protagonist who readers will cherish. The story line has plenty of royal intrigue, but focuses on the star-crossed taboo relationship between the married monarch and the heavenly healer. If this delightful fifteenth century relationship drama is any indication, sub-genre fans have a treat as Posie Graeme-Evans owes two more tales in this trilogy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"This book isn't bad but it's not really good either. It's just a light bit of fluff. Aside from the historical inaccuracies mentioned by a previous reviewer, the main problem is that the book is predicatable and the main character is a \\"Mary Sue\\". She's talented, good-hearted, virtuous and irrestible to all men. Note the lack of realistic and interesting flaws. To the reader, she's just dull. But if you just want a quick romance, you could do worse."},{"Title":"INNOCENT","review":"Before you start reading, note that there is a sequel to this novel.

However, it couldn't have ended in a better way (I wont spoil anything) and leaves you hungry to read the next installment. The stage is set for so many possibilities, that its exciting to see where The Exhile will take us....If you even remotely like historical fiction, you will LOVE this book! Its brilliantly researched, very plausible and true to the times. The character development and story-telling ability is first-rate. The court-intrigue is not overly done as in other novels.

It was recommended to me from the site and of course online it is the cover which draws you in enough to read the description. It is usually the case [judging by the cover] unless a person [not a computer] recommended it to you. I bought the book on a whim ... the description was rather catching and I've always loved medieval historical fiction. I started reading and I thought to myself I love this book already. Only once I hit the chapters containing very \\"graphic\\" descriptions of \\"attempted rape/abusive sex/and affairs\\" did I begin to realize I hopped to be ride of it and in the middle of a battle scene. I have no doubt though that the author could have throw these flings into a war scene just as easily as the others. It was absolutely, in my opinion, disgusting; there was no indication that there would be graphic sex scenes. I am thankfully to the other reviewers for they have pointed it out for other possible buyers. I am also glad I am not the only one who felt the way I do about this book. I just found out also that there are more installments. God; what can you write after you find out Anne went down the path of her Mother's choices [getting pregnant by a married king]. Also what the hell ... how did a relationship between a womanizing arrogant king and a supposed innocent educated young lady become so \\"in trawled\\" when the book did not have them say anything intelligent to one another; they hardly even talked. The book was drawn out; I wouldn't have minded the number of pages if it was detailed in the right areas.

Although I'm not an expert in history, I have read a lot of books concerning this period, and always look forward to reading more. My pleasure soon turned to dismay as I started reading. Through the first few chapters I had a growing but unspecific feeling of unease - something about the prose didn't ring true. It was nothing I could put my finger on; aspects of the writing didn't feel authentic.I persevered.Eventually I stumbled across details that I knew were wrong. For instance, in this period the term \\"Your Majesty\\" to address the King or Queen had not yet been introduced. This didn't come about until the time of the Tudors. Plantagenet monarchs were content to be addressed as \\"Your Grace\\". Next, Edward IV was several times described as wearing a collar of interlinked S's. Unlikely. Yorkist collars tended to consist of roses and suns - the interlinked S collars were favoured by the Lancastrian nobility. Then in book 2 of the series we were asked to believe there was a Jewish money-lender in Whitby. As this story is set slap bang in the middle of the three hundred and fifty year period during which all Jews were banned from England, I find this hard to believe. Book 3 (which I've read, living as I do outside the US) would have us believe a crescent moon sailed the sky for an entire night. I ask \\"On which planet?!\\" A crescent moon when new is seen only at the start of the night, and when waning is only seen in the hours before dawn. The only moon that is seen all night is a full moon.These known inaccuracies ruined the book for me. I found myself questioning every detail I read. Was it true? Was it authentic? Or was it just a flight of fancy or wishful thinking on behalf of the author? In the end I was unable to finish the 3rd book in the series because I found myself irritated to the point that I no longer cared about the fates of the characters. I'm only grateful that I got the books out of the library rather than spending hard earned cash on them.I'm left wondering how such glaring errors could make their way into a published book...or am I expecting too much that a work of historical fiction should reflect its setting accurately?"},{"Title":"Old Ironsides","review":"I recently bought a wooden model of the USS Constitution (remembering taking the tour when I was a kid) and wanted to further educate myself about the ships construction and role in history.

My daughter asked \\"why is he/she crying?\\" a LOT when we got this book. One is when they are being dropped off, which is OK in my opinion, because it can address this fear. BUT, the other ones are needless (example: author chose to illustrate the lyric \\"babies on the bus go wah, wah, wah\\" for music time, seems like a bad choice; show a boy crying who got a boo-boo, shows a girl crying when she spills her juice)- I think some of the \\"jokes\\" in the book are more for the parents than the kids, I usually omit them when I am reading. My daugther has not seemed to understand them.Overall, it is a good book because my daughter liked it. BUT, out of many books we have, I think it must have been written by a non-parent of a toddler because it just has a lot of content that is not necessarily BAD, but just not well thought out in terms of how a toddler would understand it.

I chose this book because of the friendly animal cartoons and previous reviews. I'm very happy we chose this book, but it does have a couple of things to look out for (maybe do a pre-read).In the beginning, on the page where the kids are saying goodbye to the parents, some of them are crying. My son zeros in on that immediately and I always have to tell him those are the little kids who don't know yet. Look how happy all the other kids are. What makes it easier is that the kids who are crying turn out to be the \\"bad guys\\" of the story--the kids who don't share, who take toys, etc. That seems to help him dismiss their behavior in the crying scene.Later in the story, the kids are singing during circle time. Unfortunately, the verse is \\"the babies go wah wah wah\\" and all the kids look like they're crying. They're really just mimicing crying to go along with the verse, but that was lost on my the first time we read the story. Since then, when I get to that page, I make a point to sing more of the song...a couple of the verses to the \\"wheels on the bus\\" song with really exaggerated \\"whah wah\\" so it's funny and he relaxes and seems to get the idea it's just acting.Other than that, it's great and my son loves it.

She begins with good-byes and explains that all the parents will return for them at the end of the preschool day and continues on, explaining bathroom breaks, the concept of sharing, courtesy, song time, and learning.The illustrations are colorful and whimsical, but I felt they were too 'busy.'

My daughter is nearly 3 years old and we purchased this book about 9 months ago when she attended Mother's Day Out.This book talks about preschool is a very fun way. DW narrarates her day from when her mom drops her off until her mom picks her up. She even talks about some of the \\"upsetting\\" things that can happen. However, DW LOVES Preschool, so it doesn't upset her. DW talks about everything from going potty, to circle time, to sharing, to kids that fib a bit about what they can do.My daughter can not get enough of this book.

This seems inconsistent with my expectations based on the popular Arthur television series, and is disappointing.The story itself is highly relevant for preschoolers, but the book could provide a much richer experience if the effort had been made to replace some of the colloquial phrases with more meaningful and descriptive proper English."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Dr. Seuss's extraordinary body of work is a collective treasure, but from that group of books a few stand out as his best. &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish&quot; certainly belongs in the category of Seuss's finest. Rich in clever rhymes and memorable images, this book scores a literary home run on nearly every page.Directed towards early readers, &quot;One Fish&quot; uses simple language in its funny rhymes. Seuss mixes his own created words together with standard vocabulary, resulting in such memorable lines as &quot;just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump.&quot; And these rhymes are accompanied by a rich variety of images that can only be described as &quot;Seussian&quot;: A mother fish pushing her offspring in a baby carriage, a bed being commandeered by a menagerie of animals, and more.Futhermore, in &quot;One Fish&quot; Dr. Seuss introduces us to a wonderful assortment of Seussian creatures: the singing Ying, the hopping Yop, a truly bizarre creature known simply as &quot;Clark,&quot; and many more. These images are sure to energize the imaginations of both children and adults.Seuss's images range from the joyful to the eerie, from the baroque to the earthy. I give &quot;One Fish&quot; my most enthusiastic recommendation."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My kids love Dr. Suess's books. This is one of their favorites, and mine.

Dr. Seuss books are always good, but this one is incredible. My favorite page is the one about the wet pet. One of the things that makes this book so good is the great illistrations.

I loved it.Hi Mrs. Hopper!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My son loved this book from about 4 months of age. He likes the colors and pictures. We used to read it to him when he wanted to be held but we couldn't hold him (in the car, restaurants, etc.) and he would instantly stop crying.

It's the best book we own."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book is great for the under five set. My 3 year old cousin loves it, as did my younger brother when he was a child. The book is funny and Seuss's use of rhyme helps children with word recognition. It's a terrific book for a beginning reader. My cousin has it memorized now. She's never gotten tired of it. I have found that even children who are in school will like the book if they are still a beginning reader, because it is so colorful, easy to memorize, and the rhymes are great. If your youngster doesn't have this book already, I highly reccommend that you pick it up for him/her."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My two year old really loves this book.

In fact, he gets a little scared as we go further. Some of the illustrations look too weird. The story also loses appeal and focus as it moves on. The Cat in the Hat is still the best work by Dr Seuss."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Just as Seuss covered anti-intellectualism in Green Eggs and Ham, and alternate lifestyles in Hop on Pop, the Fish book is a trenchant political analysis. Foreseeing the red vs. blue state deadlock back in the idealistic better-living-through-chemistry early 1960s, Suess contrasts the red (as in communist) fish with the all-American blue fish. This motif weaves through the book, teaching little ones the red vs. blue tension of multiculturalism (in the form of strange animals) and isolationism of Ned in his too-small bed. While most younger children will miss the allusion to Procrustes, they may remember the literary echo in Hop on Pop: Ned joins Red, Ted, and Ed in a more appropriately sized bed, and Seuss shows his support for the UN, or at least the International Monetary Fund.The tension is palpable when the young boy and girl bring home a large, walrus-like pet and wonder how their mother will feel about their deed; no preschooler could miss this reference to the Teapot Dome scandal. Similarly, their advice to get a pet Yink simply because of its fondness for pale red india writing product is a sardonic commentary on rampant consumerism. And the camel-like Wump shows his prophetic realization that our demand for oil would force us to deal with the Saudis on a regular basis.Seuss warns us of the coming divide in these United States in the introduction: \\"From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere.\\" It starts with the fish, red, blue, and black (but not white, showing where Geisel's sympathies lie), young and old, then proceeds up the evolutionary chain to large land mammals, eventually including the aforementioned school-aged boy and girl. They serve as the Adam and Eve as well as the Joe and Joan Sixpak of the book. They espouse embracing what is different while they reinforce doing the same.Seuss knew where we were headed in both 2000 and 2004, and this book shows the way out. The US has plenty of (pale) red ink, so we should get a Yink. I think."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Just don't understand why Dr.Seuss's books are so popular! The illustrations are pathetic (all animals look more or less similar, it is hard to distinguish them), there is hardly any story line, just a sequence of non-sensical rhyming words.I would stick with P.D. Eastman or Alison Jay any time"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"The more Dr. Seuss books I read, the more I wonder why people love his books so much. The original books are WAY to long (buy the board books!) and remind me of the study that shows that kids these days have a shorter attention span than in the past--15-30 seconds, the length of time of a commercial on TV. Maybe it's not the commercials that did it, but rather Dr. Seuss. After about the third page, this book switches from fish to other creatures. This really confused me. From the title, I expected the whole book to be about fish, and opposites, or at least different descriptors. But not only is it not just fish, after the third page, the whole thing falls apart. Each page has nothing to do with the following page. Why were these pages put together to form one book? Who knows. To the reviewer who says he can read it in any order--this isn't Choose Your Own Adventure. It's _supposed_ to be a sequential book."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"It is like this book was written for a baby or something. Anybody looking for enlightened literature should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Dr. Seuss published over 60 children's books, which were often characterized by imaginative characters, rhyme, and frequent use of trisyllabic meter.

This is a great classic, and it arrived in plenty of time for Christmas."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This little book can serve two functions. It's a great book to read to very small children and it can be broken up into little sections to suit short attention spans. There's counting, color recognition and loads of funny illustrations and wacky, wacky rhymes. It's lively enough that parents and kids can play together as they work their way through the silly stories--each just a page or two long.And as kids get older, this is a great book for them to read by themselves. Suess throws in made-up words so you have a book on a hook and on the book is \\"How to Cook\\" and the whole contraption hangs off the head of a creature called a Nook, who can't read so he can't cook.I love this book, which was published in 1960, the year in which I was first learning to read. I still find the plight of the Nook funny, and am delighted to gift this and a couple of other Suess stories to some youngsters who are just the age for encountering great literature. The words of this little gem may be simple but the arrangement is sublime!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"I purchased this for my granddaughter because my daughter wanted to read it to her!

But I've discovered this book now that I have a three year-old of my own, and it has become our favorites. Dr. Seuss is exceptionally skilled at playing with words and rhymes and coming up with hilarious, fun, well-crafted sentences. This book contains some of his best work. The books make learning language great fun. I was amazed last night when my daughter started rattling off the sentences in the book from memory as I read it to her, and she had great fun doing it. A children's book that both children and adults can appreciate and one that inspires in children a love of learning language: what more could a parent want?And one other editorial comment...now that I've spent much time scouring the library shelves for good books for my child, I have come to have tremendous appreciation for Dr. Seuss's talent and wit. Almost all children's book authors fall far short of the standard Dr. Seuss set decades ago.

That's an asset in an early reader - it means that the kids can stop reading when they get frustrated and pick it up again when they're ready. They don't have to worry about remembering plot points for more than two pages.I like this book, my nieces like it (when they're willing to sit through it), that's what matters.I will note that some people might object to a picture depicting some violence and calling another (sentient?) creature \\"bad\\".

I recommend the book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"On the surface One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, the third Beginner Book that Dr. Suss (Ted Geisel) wrote, might appear to be a book of merely counting, colours, opposites and other concepts. The book revolves around the motto of \\"funny things are everywhere\\", and the fish in different guises are but the welcome mat to this wild, weird world. The creatures and crazy situations in the book (Yink, Yop, Ying, Gack, Zans, etc) are designed to encourage readers to embrace the world in all its quirkiness and diversity, and there are small sentiments peppered throughout the book such as \\"These things are fun, and fun is good\\" and \\"If you wish to make a wish\\". This book may be plotless, but the theme of funny things and embracing the world help to anchor it and make it a Seuss masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book is a cute book,and easy to read.

How I loved this book as a child, with it's silly, irreverant characters and all the funny things they do. When I had a daughter of my own, she loved it, too.

Very good book to read you better get your hands on it."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"I grew up with this book and now my nine month old loves it too. the text is very rhythmic, as you would expect from Dr. Seuss. The illustrations are composed of heavy black lines and bright solid colors, making it easy for an infant to see. The text is arranged creatively around the page, adding to the visual interest and also helping the beginning reader to relate the pictures to the words. As a biologist, I interpret the central theme of the book as playing off biological diversity (Some have two feet and some have four. Some have six feet and some have more . . .), and expanding the idea to include the diversity of people and human pursuits. The fitness craze, furniture design, and silly kitchen gadgets are all covered in the brief and funny vignettes. The one limitation of the book is that there are some stereotypical differences between the interests of the boy and girl, and it is somewhat lacking in ethnic diversity. But hey, it was written in 1960. It also would be great if it had a board book edition, since it is hard to keep the little guy from crinkling the pages."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"I read this book when I was 2 and I got it out when I was 13 and I still loved it.

From here to there. Funny things are everywhere."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My 3 and a half year old absolutely loves this book/cd combo. We have the whole series. He has no trouble at all reading along with them or keeping up. In addition to reading the books along with the cd, he sometimes listens to just the cd alone. They are honestly one of his favorite things. I've never written a review in my life, but when I read the other review I wanted to write to say that my son really loved them - it would have been a shame had I read that review before buying these & my son would have missed out on something he enjoyed so much. Different kids are different but we really enjoy this series. Even when he doesn't use the cd, we have the books to read/enjoy. I hope people find my comments helpful."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Unlike most Dr. Seuss books, this book has no real plot. For the most part it is made up of unconnected pages that flow nicely into one another. The lack of plot is not something that harms the book in my eyes, I like the chance encounters with the strange creatures, and I think the lack of a plot helps to make this story special.Throughout this book we are introduced to a number of cute creatures from fish to Wumps to Zeds. Like all Dr. Seuss creations they are very cute, bold, colorful and expressive. Another characteristic of a Dr. Seuss book is how the words flow wonderful and manage to rhyme well in a manner completely unforced and effortless.

The story dives deep down into the bowels of our minds, posing us the question- what if the fish had a car? The thoughts have puzzled me for 75 years, and I am yet to discover the true solution to the problem. Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Vagaries of perception, although only Dr. Seuss mind could invent something as insipid as love. Truly, one of the most astonishing stories I have read in my life, and without a doubt the greatest, deepest, and most politically influencing novel of all time. With ventures into the intersanctum of the human construct, it's a book for anyone attempting to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book would be it! It is not so tongue-twister like a lot of Dr. Suess' books. My children love the bright colors of the characters in this book and I enjoy reading it to them. I am able to inflect different meanings to different things every time I read this book to them. It's a fun and great book on words. I read it to my nephew 10 years ago and I am still enthralled with this book.If you are looking for a book that will keep your children's attention while you're reading ~~ this book is it. It has more of a rhyming to it than his others. It's fun and sassy and bold. Perfect for kids learning to read too! This will help them find words that sound a like as well as rhyme a like.It's a definite addition to this mom's library!10-13-03"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Luckily and happily I will report that my daughter did not get confused. I did, but that's another story. She won't admit it, but I think this was her favorite Dr. Seuss book. It was the one I remember reading to her the most. I remember picking it up from the bookcase. The cover attracted me. I flipped through it and then purchased it. I read it to her every night for some time. Those were good days. I would have to say that these books made a difference in her ability to learn and want to read. Green Eggs and Ham also stands next to this book as I remember."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"I bought this based on memory instead of a quick re-read. I probably wouldn't have bought it, otherwise. The rhymes are OK, and there's a lot of silliness that seems like it is just in there to get things to rhyme. It doesn't really have a story. My daughter doesn't get engaged by it, and would rather flip through the pages to look at the pictures rather than actually read through it. Among the Seuss books, she prefers Sneetches and Yertle the most."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Came in excellent and pretty quick!

I'm sure it will be a big hit in a couple years, though."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"A rhythmic, rhyming book of real and imaginary creatures, illustrated in Seuss's delightfully engaging style. It is composed of short, funny scenes that are strung together to form a certain coherency as the creatures named become sillier and sillier. After nine or ten read-alouds it starts to feel a bit long for adults, but the short scenes make it a good fit both for rambunctious toddlers with short attention spans, and early readers who will benefit from the achievement of finishing each scene. It also comes in an audio version."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book (like many Dr Seuss Books) is a favorite bedtime read and it is one that seems to have been memorized quickly and one that started my child reading.

Of course it is a great book in its own right and will bring back many memories to so many parents."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"The title of my favorite book is One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, and Blue Fish. This book is by Dr. Seuss. Other Books by this author are:1: I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!2: Green Eggs and Ham!3: The Cat in the Hat!The Genre is fiction and the theme is best described as learning about rhyming and counting .The Authors writing style is rhythm and the main characters in this book are two kids a girl and a boy who are learning to count but learning about a strange word at the same time! My favorite character in this story is the Whump it's a moose but longer and more bumps on its back.The back round information for this paragraph is to teach younger kids to count and observe and just to have fun. The seen I think is most important/exciting is when goes 1 fish, 2 fish, red fish, and blue fish. If you want to know the ending you have to read the book.My recommendation for this book is for people who want to teach there kids to count in a fun and easy way. To summarize, I like this book because it has past on for generations.Grandma||Mom||Me"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book, as is the case with all of Dr. Seuss' books, is a delight. I have warm memories of these books being read to me by my parents as a child. It was wonderful to follow along by watching the inspired illustrations.This book might just turn your child into a poet. Even if it doesn't do that, it will teach your child to rhyme. The rhymes are magically witty and whimsical. Be forewarned. Both you and your child may be reciting rhymes in your sleep.Dr. Seuss stimulated my imagination as a child. As an author with a gift for humor, he has undoubtedly molded me as an author of humorous adult books.

One Fish... is a great book because it displays fanciful pictures of all types of creatures of the imagination, the Gox, the Yink, the pet from the park named Clark, the wet pet, the man who's feet stick out of bed, plus many more.

I remember my Second grade teacher reading this to the class and us having to do a worksheet that had us matching words that rhmey and then teaching us to figure out the syllables by clapping and then dividing words into as many syllables as the word had.

All of Dr. Seuss' books are wonderful for young readers, but this one holds a special place in my heart because of the obsession I had with a particular page in the book when I was little. It's the one with the creature who stands on his head and says, in part, &quot;My shoe is off, my foot is cold, I have a bird I like to hold.&quot; I used to stare at this page as if it were the most fascinating thing in the world.

I would have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option. The book is read MUCH TOO FAST for a child to follow along and turn the pages. The page turn signal is a tiny bell that is hard to hear and so short it gives no time to separate the pages and turn them. By the time a child gets the page turned, the reader is 4 or 5 pages ahead because they are also reading SO FAST! This could have been a really good book for an audio read along because the print is large and the words are simple and rhyming, but it is read so quickly a child just learning to read doesn't even have the chance to determine which word is being read. My 4 year old loves read along books but became so frustrated with this book he didn't want to ever read it again. Extremely disappointing as a parent and discouraging for a beginning reader. The Curious George read along series is so much better, although it doesn't have the large text or simple words. Curious George is read with interesting inflections and gives children sufficient time to follow along and turn the pages themselves. Save your money and don't buy this Dr. Seuss series."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My son loves this book and it arrived quickly.

I used to read them to my children almost every night. That is how they learned how to read, if you let your child sit next to you and listen to how many times Dr. Seuss would repeat the same word in his books. It drove me crazy but it worked to teach my children how to read at a very young age.As I read the stories we looked at the silly pictures and then eras the same words again in a short time they were correcting me, I made mistakes on purpose to see how much they were paying attention.Sitting with a child and reading to them is both a benefit to them and to you it is relaxing and fun to share such moments together."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"We read this often.

In 2009, I wrote \\"One bear, two bear. Bite bear, chew bear\\" in one of my books. Coincidence? Not at all. Call it imitative flattery. Call it a tribute.I grew up on Dr. Seuss. His wonderful, ridiculous stories brightened my childhood as much as they brightened the antique, polished pine bookcase in the otherwise formal family room in the house where I grew up. Don't get me wrong, I loved that house. My grandfather designed it and my mother painstakingly decorated it. The family room just wasn't used as an every day place. It was unofficially reserved for holidays, special guests, the occasional family meeting, and for my collection of colorful Dr. Seuss books. Even a decade and more after the books moved from my bedroom to the old bookcase in the family room, they remained there. Had my parents not boxed their belongings and moved after I reached adulthood, I suspect Dr. Seuss would still be lining those shelves.That's the effect Dr. Seuss can have on his readers: enduring fondness. The words \\"One fish two fish red fish blue fish\\" still line my mental bookshelves. I have not forgotten and I am unwilling to seek to discard them. I similarly doubt my ability to do so were I to try!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"its a good book and its not just about fish. its filled with all sorts of rhymes and silliness. its has some teachable moments. \\"what is that fish doing that makes him bad?\\" another great book from dr. suess."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"You can read iton a train.You can read itin the rain.You can read itwhere you wish.But can you read itto a fish?Do you havea child there?Do you have onein your care?If you dothen listen close.This book has morethan just a doseof fun and charmand rhyming wordscreatures morethan fish and birds.Of course it hasboth of those thingsbut better still,it has a Ying who sings.A Zans, a Gox,a Gack, a Wump,tall or shortor with a hump!Some are nearsome are farone even hasa little car.Wonders fillyour child's headas she snugglesinto bed.I cannot thinkof better timesthan those we've sharedwith Seuss's rhymes.So curl upand read aboutthe funny thingsthat bump and shout.To each and every childI saycount along with methis way.One fish, two fish,three fish, fourDr. Seussfor ever more."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Although its not as great as The Cat in the Hat, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish is certainly one of my children's favorites, and they especially love trying to read some of the rhymes outloud. Certainly a great choice for a book for your young ones."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss gives young children an excellent way to start reading independently. The book helps children learn to count to eleven and it increases their vocabulary as you read it along with them the first few times. Young children just learning to read will be able to read this book as one of their first books that they can read by themselves; and the cute illustrations will delight children and even adults everywhere.The book's plot is not entirely deep--nor should it be for this exceptionally young, tender age group. The book helps kids to learn how to count to eleven and recognize the words for those numbers; it also uses pictures to introduce words for basic colors including red, blue, black, yellow and pink. Children also explore the concepts of old and new; fast and slow; high and low; thin and fat as well as here and there. Excellent! The book also introduces the telephone and how two people can communicate by phone. Your child will love that--they'll think that the phone is a toy!The book is nicely bound and the strength of the hardcover binding makes the book tolerate the bending and occasional carelessness of a young child who is learning to read partly by using this book. Great!I highly recommend One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish for younger kids who are just learning to read. This book will increase their vocabulary by introducing words, comparisons and pictures. The child also gets a heightened awareness of the world around them; and the adorable illustrations will delight children everywhere.Great job, Dr. Seuss!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"An outstanding book for kids and adults and who want to enjoy a goodlaugh.It also very educational book, we all know reading helps you comprehend words better but this book also teaches you how to rhyme.

I used to read this to my brother YEARS ago."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book was almost not published. The publisher did not think this book would sell because it was so simple. What a genious Dr. Seuss turned out to be because of it's simplicity. One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish is a true children's classic because children never become tired of the book. They will actually wear it out from use. Older children will smile when they see the book years later and make comments along the lines \\"I loved this\\".Like all of Dr. Suess' books, it is both colorfull and whimsical. The book teaches children to read by using nonsensical animals and ryhmes. A child can read one little section and not become bored or lost because the book is not connected with a story. That is the beauty of this book. It is a childrens book written for children and their thinking. No heavy messages here, just plain fun. The colors catch the eye, the rhymes catch the ears, and the shear silliness cathes the imagination. It is truly a wonderfull gift to give a parent of younger children. Highley recommended."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This book is one of my favorite children books. This book is a real easy book to read for a young child. This book tells about the colors of fish, counting fish, adjectives of fish, what they wear. It also goes on about how many feet some animals have and it describes how fast or slow they go. Then later on it tells about how many fingers he has on his hand. Towards the end it tells about people and kids having weird pets who all serve some useful purpose or other towards the owner of the animal. This is a fun book to read and it does serve some purpose or another towards educating your child in simple but needed words for life and its adventures. This should not be very expensive and your child will read this book over and over for years to come, I know I did."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"My 19 month old son loves to \\"read\\" this book during his bath.

The nostalgia trip lasted about 3.5 seconds before I started enjoying the book in its own right as an adult. It is just plain linguistic fun. And, yeah, it will appeal to kids as well.The story itself is nonsensical fun, and the use of sounds to create that sense of fun is very creative. As only Dr Seuss can do, he makes reading the book not only fun at a mental level, but the rhythm and sounds also have the ability to make reading it fun. I found myself captivated in anticipation of what Seuss would do next with the words. The names of various creatures are also just plain fun and really appeal to the child in us all.The illustrations are what one would expect from Dr Seuss: gaudy colours and not too much detail. They are fantastic pictures, even though they are quite simple. They do not distract from the text, but there is enough there to keep younger kids focused. Of course, that should not stop us older \\"kids\\" enjoying them.This is a true classic of a book, and is among my favourites of Dr Seuss books. I have to confess to still enjoying it and know that kids do too. It is a great book and well-written.

This book is a classic example. The simple rhyming pattern combined with the wild and fantastical illustrations, provide for a great introductory book to reading. The only drawback to this book (as is the case with about half of the good doctor's works) is that there is no story; the book is basically a collection of random rhyming phrases paired with complimentary drawings. Of course, there is amusement to this type of writing and younger children find it highly entertaining. Still, other Dr. Suess stories (such as THE CAT IN THE HAT) are just as fantastical, but include a story as well.

In fact, this is conducive to a toddler's randomness - one day it's &quot;Hop hop hop, I am a Yop&quot;; another day it's &quot;From there to here.&quot;"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Allright ya little PUNKS. You go read your Tom Clancys and your sappy Danielle Steel romance novels and your &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot;s and we can even go back time to your Mark Twains and your &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;s, you go read ALL of that. Then read THIS book, and YOU tell me which one is better. Because NONE of that can match the emotional intensity of reading to your kids at bedtime: &quot;Once there was a little Nook. On his hat he had a hook. On his hook he had a book. On his book was &quot;How to Cook&quot;. But a Nook can't read and a Nook can't cook, so what good to a Nook is a hook cook book?&quot; AWESOME!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish was her pick as the best of the books by Dr. Seuss.One of the appeals of this book is that it is relatively easy to learn to read, yet has much more variety than most other early readers. So your child will feel like she or he has accomplished a lot with reading this book, which is correct.The title gives the key to why this book works well as an early reader. One word is changed at a time, with a clear illustration next to it. Most children will read the illustrations like a rebus and later associate the words with the sounds of the name for the pictures. At some point, they begin reading from the words. Very nice!Here's another sequence: &quot;black fish blue fish old fish new fish.&quot;Then, when he moves on, he uses simple rhymes: &quot;This one has a little star. This one has a little car.&quot;Next, he progresses to substituting &quot;some&quot; for &quot;fish&quot; and adding a single verb to make a sentence as in &quot;Some are read . . . . Some are old.&quot;So almost any child can soon begin to read along with few errors in the first 2 or 3 pages. Whenever the child can go no more, you can just keep going. With repetition, more of the book becomes memorized and the process continues.There is another reward for you and your child: The book also previews many of the wonderful characters and rhyming schemes that appear in other Dr. Seuss books. As a result, it will be easier to get started reading those books. You will feel like you are seeing an old friend again.You can also use each rhyme to take off on your own speculations. Our daughter used to love to come up with alternative rhymes that fit the pictures.Books like this one make it great fun to be either a parent or a child. In some cases, this book will be there for you in both roles over 20 to 40 years!Overcome your mistaken beliefs about how children can start to learn to read by seeing your child start naturally by associating the words with the pictures as you read this wonderful book to him or her!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"After reading this book to my 6 month old, I'm convinced it's never too early to read to a child.

It's smaller than the edition I grew up with; smaller than the ones my kids had.The picture shown is deceiving This edition has a big red jagged permanent thing just under the \\"blue fish\\" of the title, nearly as long as the title words \\"red fish\\" and as wide as the space between \\"red fish\\" and \\"blue fish\\". In the red splotch it says, in white, \\"Look inside if you wish for a FREE gift!\\" Boo! Yuck!"},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"Since my 7-month-old still thinks books are for putting in your mouth, I've been buying him bath books. I bought this one sight unseen from Amazon, and as much as I love the classic \\"One Fish, Two Fish,\\" I was a little disappointed. First, the book is small, even for a bath book (about 4x6 inches -- the \\"8.3 x 4.8\\" dimensions in the Amazon description are just plain WRONG). Second, the book was shorter than I expected. It consists only of the first 8 pages of the original \\"One Fish.\\" Of course, the baby doesn't know how abridged the book is, so he enjoys it. And the colors are bright, the printing is sharp, and the overall package is high-quality and holds up to lots of handling. But there's not much there to read to him.Overall, if you're looking for a durable \\"One Fish\\" edition that's good for mealtimes, or bath time, or for taking in the stroller, this is an excellent buy.

The fun filled fantasy world of Dr Suess has lost none of its charm. &quot;One Fish Two Fish&quot; is one of his best.The theme of this book is &quot;funny things are everywhere&quot;. Dr Suess goes on to prove this by introducing a long list of fantastic but friendly characters. The creatures are at times outrageous looking but they are never frightening. There is no chance of monster-phobia developing in children after reading these books.Anything is possible in this book. You have to love the seven hump Wump with its eight legs. It bears an uncanny resemblance to a camel.Children will get to love the rhyme and rhythms of the words in this book. Children will be encouraged to make their own word play. It is possible new skills in creative thinking and even musical aptitude may emerge in children after having fun in the Suess world. On thing is for sure, a love of reading will certainly be encouraged.Spatial thinking is encouraged with humorous signposts to Near and Far, and Here and There. Young minds will adore taking the advice &quot;if you wish to wish a wish&quot;.&quot;One fish two fish&quot; makes a great bedtime book.

But it's a family favorite, and I'm sure it will be a family favorite for your child. What educational value does it have for children?? Well, it does help teach children to rhyme.

The cover attracted me. I flipped through it and then purchased it. I read it to her every night for some time. Those were good days.

(Ironically, this fit very well with a lesson). And yet there is something incredibly fun about the random creatures trotting themselves out in all their quirky Suessian glory. So no, there is no logical plot, but we get fun pictures and dazzling rhymes that we love."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"You might think that &quot;One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish&quot; is a Dr. Seuss book about counting or colors (or counting and colors or even counting colors), but that would simply be the hook for something much larger. The thesis of this Beginner Book appears opposite the first page, where we are informed by a small creature with a giant mustache and a yellow star for a belly button that &quot;From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere.&quot; If anything this Dr. Seuss book has bits and pieces from lots of other Dr. Seuss books. You have a series of opposite because fish are not only red and blue but old and new, you have Ned who does not like his bed, there is Yop who only likes to hop from finger top to finger top, and all sorts of strange looking animals. There is even a creature that looks like the Cat in the Hat except he is completely yellow, including his hat, has a polka dot bow tie, and eleven fingers.Consequently, if &quot;One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish&quot; is one of the first Dr. Seuss books that a beginning reader begins reading they should go back and read it again after they have gone through the rest of the good doctor's books because they will then be better able to appreciate some of the familiar faces in this book. However, since this is not a book for early beginning readers, most kids will get to this one after they have covered the basic Dr. Seuss books and become well accustomed to his delightful volumes of rhymed absurdity. This particular book has been inspiring the imagination of beginning readers since 1960 and there is no reason for it to stop with that endeavor at this point in time."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"An epic, amazing, astonishing tale into true philosophy of the human intellect. The story dives deep down into the bowels of our minds, posing us the question- what if the fish had a car? The thoughts have puzzled me for 75 years, and I am yet to discover the true solution to the problem. Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Vagaries of perception, although only Dr. Seuss mind could invent something as insipid as love. Truly, one of the most astonishing stories I have read in my life, and without a doubt the greatest, deepest, and most politically influencing novel of all time. With ventures into the intersanctum of the human construct, it's a book for anyone attempting to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose."},{"Title":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish","review":"This was a really good book.

The first few pages (which comprise the \\"fish part\\") are really engaging and cute. And then the book \\"gets weird\\", as my husband puts it (he remembered this from childhood, expressing surprise that I didn't). My daughter let me get about 2/3 through the book before she just declared that she wanted to go back to the \\"fishie\\" part. She kept wanting to hear more about the fishies. I felt bad because, when she saw the cover, she thought it was a book about fishies, and she loved the beginning... so I think she's disappointed. I am, too.

If only the messages in today's music were as positive as Dr. Suess.Kids love rhymes, and parents love reading them to kids. It's like we're all hard-wired to enjoy rhythm which is almost spelled the same as rhyme. All, enough with the deep thinking, I recommend all of Dr. Suess' work to parents to read to kids of all ages. They are all a joy and this book is no exception. The illustrations are original, whimsical and so much fun that knowing how kids like the same books read over and over to them, this book works for me.

I still treasure it to this day. However, I recently reread it for a Psychology class I am taking at Cal State Northridge. After closely analyzing this book, I noticed that there is a lot of gender role stereotyping. For instance, most of Dr. Seuss' main characters tend to be male. The boy in this book is shown boxing, while the little girl is shown combing an animal's hair. While riding a tandem bike, the boy is in front, thus in control. The boy is shown leading the girl throughout the entire book. I realize that the time this book was written in is a bit different that the times today, but I still think that children should be taught about gender equality. Would I recommend this book? Definitely, it is a great way to help children learn to read, as well as expand their imagination.

This book shows the primitive state of this field - in a world where mathematical modeling/prediction of time series data is quite common, this group is still chugging along with their primitive graphs and other faux science.Overall, the book is mathematically childish and does not even mention the word \\"computer\\" once, let alone provide even a hint at a quantitative framework for interpreting the recordings. There are some arrhenius-style equations rehashed from the literature to describe diffusion and the like, but there is no coherent mathematical theme to move the reader to embrace a model for any of these phenomena.It's like the little part of biology that physicists and applied mathematicians have, so far, ignored, much to the delight of the electrophysiology community, who still continues, unbothered and untested, to waste grant money and resources on their stamp-collecting projects.In a nutshell, it's the classic text in electro-phenomenology."},{"Title":"ION CHANNELS OF EXCITABLE MEMBRANES","review":"I got this book for a class and never used actually used it.

With the patch-clamp technique, we have found a way to explore other interesting channles. To remind you, there are a world of ion channels!

From a distinctly jaunty derivation of the Nernst equation to the page-turning thrills of non-stationary fluctuation analysis, the book is hard to put down. It does bog down a little in Chapter 10, \\"Elementary Properties of Ions in Solution\\"--after all, is there anyone who isn't already aware of the fundamentals of electrodiffusion?

It is an excellent introduction to the molecular biology of channels, told with an eye to history as well as science."},{"Title":"ION CHANNELS OF EXCITABLE MEMBRANES","review":"There are new books on this subject, but they are not as strong on fundamentals as this classic.One of the surprises in this splendid, fascinating book arises from Hille's thumbnail history of the very idea of individual ion channels.It is a much more recent idea than I realized. Not until the mid-1960s did neurophysiologists finally arrive at the now commonplace image of an ion channel as an individual structure - an ion-specific porthole or passageway through the cell membrane.Hille emphatically characterizes the individual channel as &quot;a discrete entity,&quot; and as &quot;a distinct molecule.&quot; By 1965 this concept had been in the air for a while, but it did not prevail or become the dominant picture until binding studies were conducted with tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin. Largely thanks to this work, by the late 1960s, the author recounts, the names &quot;Na Channel&quot; and &quot;K Channel&quot; began to be used consistently.The familiar picture of individual channels embedded in the cell membrane was brought to us by the magic of long division. For example, &quot;Dividing specific binding by membrane area yields an average saxitoxin receptor density of 110 sites per square micrometer on the axon membranes of the vagus. We now know that the tetrodotoxin-saxitoxin receptor is a single site on the Na channel, so this experiment tells us how many Na channels there are in the membrane. Surface densities of 100 to 400 channels per square micron are typical ...&quot;The picture you get is one of barrel like protein ports floating like buoys in the membrane, nicely regimented into rows and columns, neatly anchored at the intersection points of an imaginary grid. It is, of course, an image made ideal by the arithmetic which originally produced it.Hille concludes: &quot;Now that we can record from single channels - and even purify the chemically, and sequence and modify their genes - there remains no question of their molecular individuality.Well, it is in some sense just a semantic matter, but a few observers, of whom I am one, think there remains after all a colossal, towering, staggeringly important question about the molecular &quot;individuality&quot; of these passages. This is because they can be structurally and functionally linked.Linked receptors are a commonplace of biochemistry. Extensive linkage between ion channels in nerves would open up some very nice possibilities, explain many mysteries, etc.Is there any evidence for linked or complex ion receptors? At the end of Chapter 5, in a literature summary, the author remarks on the then newly discovered double barreled anionic channels, and notes some Cl channel electrophysiological data that seem to make it look &quot;as though the channel were a cluster of pores - like a sieve or an aggregate of straws. An alternative would be that the pore fluctuates through frequent rearrangements of many constituent parts.&quot;This is precisely the type of liberated thinking that could get us somewhere fast. If you put two pulls on an ordinary zipper, you can create a pore that travels. It is easier, not harder, to come up with this kind of mechanism by assembling protein subunits. You can also make starbursts, &quot;cootie catchers&quot;, &quot;Jacob's ladders&quot; sliding anagram toys, and many other plaything analogs using protein repetitive units, links, foldings and conformational changes.To what end? Why should linked or continuous pore structures be more interesting that discrete and isolated pores?Imagine a nerve in which finely graded input information can be conveyed, by all-or-nothing impulses, all the way from input to output using, let's say, 100 distinct information channels that extend longitudinally from one end of the nerve to the other. The longitudinal channels are created by linking transverse channels. A corduroy membrane. Possibly linear, possibly helical.In a nerve of this type, an increment of graded information is inherent in the longitudinal channel number: 1, 2, 3, etc. An impulse traveling down the axon would appear, to conventional instruments used to study nerves, as the blank, familiar, all-or-nothing impulse so confidently presented to us on page 1 of every neurophysiology text. But such an impulse would not be blank. It would be freighted with meaning. With this single impulse, the intensity of the original input stimulus could be conserved and communicated all the way to the brain.The idea is reasonable because it points to a type of neuron that would enable us to think as fast as we do.It is also reasonable in light of evidence accumulated since 1993 (See Spikes, Rieke et al) that a single impulse does in fact convey information to the brain. Adrian was wrong. The long familiar rate code isn't one. Somehow, a single nerve impulse carries information. How? The secret seems inherent in the neuron - and the neuron is a mechanism built up using ion gates.Ion channel research is becoming one the most fruitful and fashionable fields in biological science. There are more recent books on the subject, (Frances Ashcroft's for example) but perhaps because they must cover more ground, they seem a lot less careful about pointing out the assumptions and reiterating the history of the ideas on which the field is grounded.This book is bedrock. Bertil Hille identifies in precise language each significant underlying assumption, and details the experimental tools that were used to develop the (still pretty fuzzy) picture we hold in our minds' eyes of the nerve membrane. As the field evolves, some of the basic assumptions are going to have to be re-examined. This book will help you understand exactly what they were and, thus, where to push for fresh possibilities.The author has received the Lasker award, and this one quite often foreshadows the Nobel. You can sense, in reading this book, the extreme quality of his science and of his intelligence."},{"Title":"ION CHANNELS OF EXCITABLE MEMBRANES","review":"If you're thinking of learning about electrophysiology (not cardiac), this is THE resource. It discusses most of the known ion fluctuations and gives a great deal of background in the proper physics to aid understanding. The style is dry and dense; this is not a book that one reads multiple chapters at a time, but it will be helpful to have on the shelf to look up some information quickly. I took off a star because, as good and highly recommended a resource as this is, it's less practical than other books on electrophysiology. This is a 'before the experiment' book-it helps identify the channels you're looking at, what kind of glass to choose, what drugs might be appropriate for your experiment. It is less helpful with the 'during the experiment' questions than, say, Patch Clamping. It doesn't explain as well what a good seal looks like on your oscilloscope, for instance.To sum: great resource for electrophysiologists, pair with another book for the practical side of actually performing the experiment."},{"Title":"ION CHANNELS OF EXCITABLE MEMBRANES","review":"The scientist and researcher will find this book of much value as a resource and reference for those studying cellular action, function and response.

But for anyone involved in patch clamping, this is a must read."},{"Title":"ION CHANNELS OF EXCITABLE MEMBRANES","review":"This is the best ion channel book in the world. It is good if you are a grad student or above working on ion channels or, if you are even just doing an honours project in them.

While the book is enjoyable for a light read, it lacks a lot of the tension and drama that characterized the first season of Andromeda.The book takes place in the immediate prehistory to the premiere episode and follows Beka and the crew on a mission and Tyr being a mercenary. There were some interesting points, and some parts were quite obvious and predictable to a fan of the show. Nothing really catches a person off-guard. And there wasn't much that was revealing or insightful.Think of the Alan Foster Star Trek books of the 1970s. It's like that."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Consistent with the Andromeda universe, and it was interesting to learn what took place before the Andromeda Ascendent was taken out of the blackhole. However, as with all Andromeda books; far too much profanity. It's not necessary to the story line and doesn't make it more real. Show me more drama in place of the profanity."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Man, I can't believe it's come to this: that I'm writing reviews of novels based on \\"Andromeda\\". My mother begged me to become a doctor, but instead I decided to go into the highly exciting world of Betamax sales, and now I'm reduced to this. Look for me to cough up a review of a \\"Red Dwarf\\" episode guide soon or something.Anyway. This novel is by Keith DeCandido and is the first published volume of \\"Andromeda\\" fiction. It's a prequel to the show's pilot episode and establishes backstories for Tyr and for how Trance (her happy and guileless purple version, not the later enigmatic and secretive gold version) hooked up with Beka and stuff. DeCandido does a good job of capturing the flavor of the show's first season (by far the best out of the four that have aired thus far), and even throws in cryptic citations and sayings as chapter headers, just like the actual TV episodes do. Lot of Nietzschean maneuverings and plots. The bits about Tyr and his ilk are really nice. The biggest bonus, though, is that Dylan only appears in about five pages. Yay! 'Cuz he is just terrible.This is better than a lot of the recent episodes and is worth reading if for no other reason that that DeCandido wrote it. He's done a lot of excellent Trek work and if you like reading this sort of thing, I would highly recommend that you pick up his efforts. He shows a great deal more imagination than most authors in these series and does some real nice character work. If you've got some time to blow and you want a taste of \\"Andromeda\\" in its \\"almost good\\" period, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Fans of Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda are sure to be pleased with this first novel based on the popular Science Fiction television series. Author Keith R.A. DeCandido has crafted a well written and compelling story in the new hardcover novel Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions. Penning the first novel in a series can be difficult but Mr. DeCandido has risen magnificently to the challenge presenting for the readers enjoyment a tale that has action, adventure, humor and spot on characterizations.Destruction of Illusions is a prequel, taking the reader through the story of how Beka Valentine and the crew of the Eureka Maru and Tyr Anasazi and his band of mercenaries came to find themselves part of the bold salvage operation of the Andromeda Ascendant in \\"Under the Night\\", Andromeda's pilot episode. Fittingly Destruction of Illusions begins and ends with the recovery of the Andromeda Ascendant.As the reader follows the crew of the Maru through the events and adventures that lead them to Dylan, the hardships and realities of their life eking out a living in the former Commonwealth are vividly presented. We also get to learn what drove Tyr to do what he has done in his pursuit of restoring the Kodiak Pride to glory. Along the way there is a daring breakout, a liberal sprinkling of Nietzschean politics, a dangerous and dramatic museum heist, the appearance of several familiar faces and most importantly great character development. Oh yes, and Dylan and Roomie are in it as well.DeCandido adroitly fleshes out the back-stories established onscreen for the characters in a tight well-paced plot. In the style of the show each chapter begins with a pertinent quotation. Since he has only been mentioned twice in the series, one character we finally get learn more about is Vexpag, Trance's forerunner on the Maru. He even gains a given name in the novel. But the character that I found myself seeing in a new light was Rev Bem. His importance to Beka and his unique personality shines through better in the pages of Destruction of Illusions that it has onscreen. Each and every character and event in Destruction of Illusions is keenly and skillfully portrayed allowing the reader to loss themselves in the story right up until you turn the last page."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Author Keith R.A. DeCandido has even surpassed his Farscape novel House of Cards with this book... and I did not even think that was possible. He proves that he knows the characters of the series well enough to capture each individual's voice perfectly and manages to mix elements of the show only previously discussed.Whether it is Charlemagne Bolivar, Rev Bem, Seamus Harper or the Andromeda Ascendant herself, the characters are &quot;spot-on&quot; with how they are portrayed on the series. And even Vexpag is someone we grow to care about, even though you already know what is coming his way in terms of his fate. When Trance shows up... I had a huge smile on my face.This book is highly recommended, especially for those fans who enjoyed seasons one and two, and those who miss that quality from season three. This is bar-none one of the best media tie-in novels I have ever read. I look forward to more Andromeda work, particuarly from Keith."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Finished this book in one day and all I can say is GREAT! As a die-hard Classic Star Trek fan I was quick to dismiss Andromeda as the latest Trek \\"rip off\\". What I have discovered after watching the first selection of episodes on DVD (received as a gift), is that the show is witty, intelligent, smart and fun (something that Star Trek lacks today). This book is as fun to read as the show is fun to watch. It is a great intro to the series with dead on characterization and fresh back stories (especially for Beka and crew). The author did a great job referring to popular episodes and is some cases expanded upon them in subtle ways.This is a great read and reminds me of the early Star Trek novels of the 1970s and 1980s when authors had the freedom to expand upon another creators universe. Great job Mr. DeCandido! I look forward to your next visit to Andromeda!"},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"This is the first time I've ever posted a review on Amazon about a book. While I enjoy reading quite a bit (and follow quite a few series such as Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.), my feelings after reading a book tend to vary from &quot;great&quot; to &quot;okay&quot; with few eliciting a reaction any more negative than that. Since this is the case, I guess I've felt that my reviews would be a bit boring.That said, I've been praising DESTRUCTION OF ILLUSIONS on the Star Trek books board (Keith DeCandido is an author of many Trek books and editor of the &quot;Star Trek: S.C.E.&quot; eBook series) ever since I read it so I figured that I should put it in writing here as well.DeCandido has a real knack for getting dialogue right in his series books. I mean, you have absolutely no problem imagining Beka Valentine or Seamus Harper or Tyr Anasazi saying DeCandido's lines.The fact that this is a prequel novel is also nice because it lends a &quot;special&quot; feeling to it, giving the reader something he or she would most likely not see on the average episode of the TV series. The only possible downside, also due to the book's prequel nature, is that Captain Dylan Hunt and &quot;Rommie&quot; only appear in the first and last chapters (the present day framing story for the rest of the book's prequel setting), so if you are wanting to read about those characters, well, they're not in it very much.Still, that's a very small thing (and some might actually consider it a good thing because it gives the spotlight a chance to shine on the other characters for once). So, if you are an &quot;Andromeda&quot; fan, I'd definitely recommend DESTRUCTION OF ILLUSIONS to you."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"This book is hard to put down.After watching the dreck being passed off by the TV show's 3rd year, this book comes as a welcome and surprising read. I don't expect a lot from sci-fi tie-ins, and I usually skip them. The Destruction of Illusions is really well written and renders the characters' dialog crisply.There are many wonderful scenes such as the commendation over a fallen mercenary; Tyr's humiliation by a Nietzschean field marshal; the \\"dog house\\" scene with Captain Valentine, Rev Bem, and Harper -- to name a few."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"if you like the show you will like this book. it is not a rehash of an episode you have already seen. the author imagined what the crew were doing before they discovered the andromeda. the best part? dylan is frozen in time so he's not the focus of the novel as he is in most of the tv shows. the bad part? very little trance until the end, although she does play an important part. lots of beka, so if she is your favorite character you will be pleased. i would definitely like to see more andromeda original novels from this author."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Since i try to be a positive person ill start with the positive. The plot sequence was relatively good. By this i mean the plot fit the personality of the characters from the original show and one would have no problem visualizing the characters in these situations. However this was the only good point. The dialogue written between characters was awful. The dialogue was very choppy and throught the entire book made the characters sound awkward. The dialogue certainly failed to portray the characters from the show. In my opinion it was something i would have expected to find on a fan fiction site and definitely not something that should have been printed and sold. The dialogue was just that bad."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"I had high hopes for this book to fill out the background on the shows main characters, other than Dylan, but found it rather lacking. If you want to know more about Beka, Tyr and Rev. Bem, the book does a fairly good job but hardly expends any effort on Trance and Harper who have great potential for interesting story lines. In fact, there is far more expansion upon a tertiary character who is barely memorable from the first episode than for Trance and Harper put together. In addition, if you're a Trance fan, you likely won't care much for the less than flattering descriptions. Anyway, it's not a bad story but could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"Oh, the beauty of the backstory, the prequel, the whatEVER you want to call it, especially when it comes to novel vs. television. It gives a writer a goodly amount of space to supply the characters with all the depth and strange habits that make for meaty personalities - something TV viewers might have to wait a long time to see, if they *ever* get to. And, as has been the case with pretty much every one of Keith DeCandido's novels, the man doesn't disappoint, providing us an excellent and plausible look at how it came to be that Beka Valentine should rescue Dylan Hunt in the pilot episode of \\"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda.\\" Of course, now I really wanna go back and watch that pilot again, armed with this new information. Nice job, oh Great Hairy One."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions","review":"I found this book rather enjoyable but, despite the great details, still somewhat lacking. A lot of effort was put into giving great insight into the characters of Beka, Tyr, and to a lesser extent Rev Bem, but Harper and Trance (my two favourite characters) get rather short shrift. I had high hopes that there would be more about Harper and his life while on earth, but there was more detail on the thoughts and history of a tertiary character that I barely remember from the first episode. In addition, it is plain that the Author doesn't care much for the character of Trance, as displayed by his repeated less than flattering descriptions. Given all this I'm rather surprised that I even gave it a 3! However, I am an Andromeda fan and the book definitely gave a better insight into where Beka, Tyr, and to a lesser extent the rest of the crew, were coming from.So, if you like Beka, buy the book and you won't be disappointed.

I soon found myself unable to put it down, being immediately absorbed into the young protagonist's life.At first, I thought this book would not be my cup of tea, so to speak. Boy, was I wrong!We start with an introduction into the life of a nineteen year old young man, struggling with his thoughts of the future, his parents, girls, his lot in life, and how he is going to fit into his own life. His father's thoughts seem to dominate his musings, and he struggles with himself in the dawning realization that his father just may be right.He has no direction, and questions his own actions and morality in the light of the path his friends have followed. Then something truly amazing happens to him, something so surreal and fantastic that he finds himself both frightened and awed by it.Introduced now is Theodore, a strange little man who leads our protagonist on an amazing journey. Theodore tries to show the youth a new and different perspective of life, and in the process the youth finds a fresh attitude towards both himself, and his parents, and the life he once led.In the midst of all the bizarre and odd things happening to him, and Theodore's eccentric tirades that perplexingly match his father's opinions, the youth discovers that sometimes where you are at in life, both in the physical and metaphysical realms, can be the most pleasing moment in time even if you cannot see it then.This is an amazingly well written book by a first time author, and whether you agree with the political aspects that arise in the storyline or not, you will not walk away untouched by the changes in the youth's life, nor the changes in his physical and mental worlds.

With expert prose and careful characterization, the author introduces the Youth, an unnamed young man who lacks self-esteem, is sexually frustrated, and has lost his belief in God. If Mickels had continued in this same vein, with the same tone and relatively subtle unfolding, this could have been a moving book. Instead, in an abrupt change, the Youth is brought aboard a spacecraft and undergoes a moral tutelage that hits the reader over the head, again and again, with the author's beliefs. The conflict - the Youth's lack of confidence in a bold world - takes second seat to moral proclamations and apocalyptic lessons and plot turns. When the conflict is finally resolved, it seems like an afterthought.When Mikels learns that he can develop the lives of his characters without \\"divine\\" intervention to promote his views, then he will succeed as a novelist. However, right now his skill with words exceeds his storytelling ability. The insistence on calling the main character the Youth while naming all the other characters seems pointless and contrived, even annoying at times. Perhaps if the main character had been given a name, it would have personalized the middle part of this story, making it more relevant and less dogmatic.Of novella length (138 pages of fairly large type), this book can be read in a single sitting. I recommend this book for those who like morality stories and who aren't bothered by heavy-handed storytelling. I give it four stars for the writing, two for the story."},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"What a treat! What a rarity! A book for the intelligent reader.You will first be captivated by the youth, the main character of the book, as you see yourself in his disillusionment of his ho-hum existence, wondering, searching for meaning to his life. Here begins the youth's - and the reader's - journey through a metaphysical world that explores the essence of life's meaning. D. Mikels writes with a fluidity, a majestic and modern style, that easily and quickly carries the reader along the turbulent river of the youth's enlightenment. As the youth questions and probes many of life's ambiguities, the reader will, without a doubt, also examine his own beliefs and values. The physical, mental, spiritual, and sexual awakening of the youth leads him to a new \\"dawn\\".I can't complete a review of this book before applauding the awesome writing skills of D. Mikels. His style I found reminiscent of the early writings of Stephen King - extremely descriptive, well-paced, exciting, and emotional.You will read this book more than once ( I did!)."},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"Have you ever been in the twilight zone of reality? When you are not sure if this is really happening or you are dreaming? When you wake up in a cold sweat just to find yourself in the middle of a nightmare? The nightmare where no one cares and you care of no one. The world where you don't fit and you don't want to fit in it anyway? This is the world which Mr. D. Mikels opens to us thru the eyes of a teenage boy in the nowhere town. Little New Mexico town where people ether half asleep or half awake. He finds himself a new world, the world of his own reality and the more he believes in it, the more real this world becomes for him.Excellent and very original debut novel by a new and very talented author. His stile and originality reminded me the early films by Louis Bunuel. Can't wait for the next book by D. Mikels!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"This book is about the transformation of a Youth disconnected from life and the people around him and the process of awakening into a young adult who is aware of life's possibilities ... Realistic and captivating right from the start, it is told in the third person always referring to the main character as, \\"the Youth\\". Somewhat disconcerting at first, one realizes this literary technique emphasizes the true disconnect the Youth has from himself. The author captures people and places with depth and detail. He gives us glimpses of the natural landscapes with the flora and fauna of New Mexico. One sentence, in chapter one, encapsulates the essence of the novel: \\"The Youth, unaware of the magnitude of his philosophical deliberations, prepared to cut the very last swath of bluegrass.\\" This sentence prepares the reader for the journey which awakens the Youth to his full self ... From a safe distance, the third person, we enter the mind and feelings of the Youth as he relates to his everyday life as a high school senior, preparing to enter college. We know about his close friends, we know his insecurities around the opposite sex, and his relationship to his Granddad, Dad, Mom, and younger brother Paul, the successful athlete in the family. He wants to escape from Sanchez, the small town in New Mexico where he grew up ... In an unexpected way it is New Mexico, with it's unique energy vortex, and Roswell incident of the past, which provides the very link to an experience, either a dream or a \\"close encounter\\" which transforms the Youth into a risk taker, a more open person, one who is integrated, essentially a complete human being. This is an impressive first novel, an existential exploration of human nature, a highly recommended read. This reader is looking forward to a sequel or second novel by this gifted author.Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"D. Mikels' novel, \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" takes a nameless youth through a personal coming of age journey, and a second more mystical adventure. Both involve growth, spiritual awareness and finally, transcendence.The teen, called the Youth, is a loner, an outsider in school as well as in his own family. He is in the throes of discovering his adolescent sexuality, with much guilt, and is unable to express his thoughts and feelings to anyone. As far as females are concerned, he doesn't have a clue as to what they're about, nor does he relate well to most people. Yet, in his earnest struggles for maturity, he is an extremely sympathetic figure. The Youth's search for meaning, for love and guidance bring him to a small New Mexican town where he unexpectedly and literally travels to the heavens for enlightenment. It is here he experiences the dawn of his transcendence.This is D. Mikels first novel. It is well written, original, and thought provoking. Mikels deliberate use of symbolism as a vehicle to explore moral transformation is fascinating. The narrative contains some fantastical elements, however, which do challenge believability. And sections of Part 2 express rather fervent political views, more fitting in an essay than a novel. I am reminded of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" I so enjoyed the book, but the last section was a political thesis that I had problems with in the context of the novel. Overall, this is an excellent debut. I have read the author's second novel, \\"Walk-On\\" where he demonstrates tremendous maturation as a writer. Mikel's career as an author is one to follow! Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"DAWN OF THE TRANSCENDENCE was the first book of its kind that I had ever read. I'm an avid reader, but I mostly read true crime novels or fictional suspense and mystery novels.Since reading this book I have begun to branch out and read more sci-fi, fantasy type books.Although the book had some imagery I'd rather not have put into my head, I understood the reasons for it. Set against the backdrop of New Mexico the book deals with the thoughts and reactions of a 19 year-old on the brink of manhood. To him the world is fouled and confused and he doesn't understand his own existence. He's lonely and troubled, yet reluctant to latch onto the \\"anything goes\\" attitude found amongst friends and schoolmates.With the help of an extra-terrestrial named Theodore, the boy begins to unearth his identity. The conservative side of D. Mikels is seen as Theodore teaches the boy about consequences. A memorable line from Theodore: \\"Behold the hypocrisy of those your society designates as pro-choice. They state their arguments, each of them having had the luxury of being born!\\"This book is a good read and quick one too. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a journey of self-discovery. You will also appreciate the descriptive powers of Mikels as he keeps his characters finely tuned and the reader engrossed with the next stage of awareness for the boy simply known as \\"the youth.\\""},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"Dear Reader,Attention. May I have your attention, please? I would like for you to consider the new book by D. Mikel's \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" as your next reading pleasure. Why? Because you owe it to yourself to shift from what is comfortable in your thinking to contemplating aspects that may appear uncomfortable on the surface but ring hauntingly true (depending on your point of view). Either way you will grow as a reader, a thinker, and will re-evaluate your own values and ideas of morality.The format, content, and metaphysical concepts are very artistically and skillfully woven into a philosophical, morality tale for the new century. The title character is un-named and heart-breakingly fragile. He is the perfect vehicle for representing the vulnerabilities of us all as he is whisked away from the mundane to the super-natural. His journey is one of enlightenment of the mind and of the senses. The moral tone is articulated with intelligence, sincerity, and geniuine concern. The reader may or may not agree with the author's point of view. That, however, is precisely what the author had in mind! D. Mikels is a master at creating an original,fresh, and inventive canvas on which he paints a future heavy with past burdens, yet daringly hopeful in it's new Dawn of Transcencence."},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"Well, more or less, that's true. This book reminds me somewhat of Keith Cymry's Hope in a Nutshell, but that one deals more with governmental corruption and spiritual mythology. This novel isn't very long, so it's considerably easy to get through, and D. Mikels shows us how rooted he is to the vast and well described mid section of America. He also shows the reader that he is very solidly based in a conservative values system with which I mostly agree, and his spiritual beliefs coincide (naturally) with that train of thought.Mikels is clever enough not to write from a direct Christian perspective, but it is undeniably there amid some rather course sexual passages and occasional fits of dialogue full of aggressive language. His message still comes through loud and clear, and I don't see liberals lauding this work too much. That's alright because, in spite of the two disturbing aspects of this short novel, I found that he has a very fluid writing style, the richest of his talents being able to describe scenery in a beautiful and poetic manner that seems effortless for him.While his insistence on calling our protagonist \\"the Youth\\" is a bit annoying at times, still, the character is represented as so many young people and actually seems to represent the average human male as much as Kris's character represents the average female. In short, this is a book with a message for everybody. The entire flying saucer/time machine aspect of the story almost makes one assume that Theodore and Emily are angels sent to enlighten these two sole survivors of a violent and desensitized world to be purified and begin anew is somewhat similar to the description of the Rapture in the book of Revelations. Though it's not anything new, the story is told in an entertaining way and, if you are amenable to some of the writer's beliefs, it will set your mind into thought about how you conduct your own life."},{"Title":"Dawn of the Transcendence","review":"Dawn of the Transcendence is an intriguing story about a bright but insecure young man struggling to free himself from his own adolescent, emotional quagmire. He is further frustrated by the realization that, although he's not lost, he's not quite sure where he's going. But The Youth is not willing to blindly follow the path of those before him, even those he loves and trusts most, because he's no longer convinced that THEY know where THEY'RE going. Reluctantly, he has abandoned his spiritual beliefs. Religion, at face value, just doesn't make sense any more. He needs proof. The Truth.Sound familiar? Don't believe it for one minute. Out of the darkness comes a most unusual dawn, illuminating those first steps on the long, twisted road to becoming a man. Thus he begins his journey on a path that has heart.This novel, by D Mikels, is exceptionally well written. The words flow pleasantly forth and swirl around the libido, making it hard to put down. It may seem like an easy read, but pay attention as the pages are cleverly peppered with symbolic resolve. Put on your reading between the lines glasses and hang on.

A few weeks ago I finished reading the \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" by D. Mikles. Than I set there for a long while quietly, hard swallowing my coffee and trying to switch my brain in to another gear. But my thoughts kept coming back to the book I just read. It was not a book overly large and full of great thoughts and ideas capable to generate such a reaction from me. It was just some hundred and fifty pages novel. I read a few books before and I heard a few thoughts as well. What could be new? Why was I so deep in my thoughts after reading this one? Was it because the thoughts of the author expressed in the book matched mine? Was it because of the sharpness of the language or the clearness of the thoughts? Was it because the world we are living in was dissected with such a surgical precision of not only a good writer but a responsible human been, who cares? Was it because I care as well?Did I like it? I cannot answer this question. This is not a book for liking or disliking. This book is one of those I keep close. I open them quite often just to read a few passages, just to make sure that there are other people with a beating heart. Sometimes I am not certain that there are any left. Reading this book is a privilege and many of us earned it. We earned the privilege to read good books and to hear words of the people with heart. You will understand me when you read it yourself.

It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.I love Jane Austen. I tend to love writers and read everything that an author has written, and Jane was the first author who I fell in love with.V."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

Though she loved him and continues to love him, he could not provide her with the security and prestige her family felt was her due. He goes off to sea and Ann settles down to a life of servitude to her family. Years later, a wealthy Captain Wentworth returns with the idea of marrying -- not Ann but one of her young in-laws.When I first read Persuasion, I was too young to understand Anne's position. Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice. It takes time to warm to the main characters. If you give it that time, Anne and Frederick's love story is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"extra period piece.

The story took place in the 19th century in Kellynch hall. Anne and Captain Wentworth was in love. Anne's father didn't wanted Anne to married to Captain Wentworth because of the social class. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returned having made his name and fortune with the British Navy, and its now his turn to reject her. Anne still love Captain Wentworth but her father persuaded her not to married the man of not having good money. The three main characters of Persuasion is Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and Sir Walter Elliot. The theme was Social mobility. Sir Walter objects to letting the house to an admiral because the navy offends his two most valued traits.Persuasion is for teenagers to adults type of audience. The romance go toward older people. This is a type of book for people who are mature. People who are older would love this book more than a younger person because the book is a classical book. Persuasion was a very appealing book. The was very awkward. They should change the ending because it sound crazy. They should made it sound like they got married instead of them engaged. It was a good book because it show how someone was persuaded to not married someone. Anne was in the world because the person she love , she couldn't get married to him. The story shows how much trails they had to go through to get together. Persuasion is considered to be a classic because it show how people got married in the 19th Century. The 19th Century romance was beautiful. It is also considered a classic because they married their cousins a lot in this story, they didn't mind if they married their cousin. Now these days, that crazy to married your cousin. I really recommend this book to people who like to read literature. So I believed that adults should read this more because they would be interested in it. I also recommend for people who love to read books. I rate this book \\"Persuasion\\" a three star becuause the ending was not good, they should change the ending.

Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.

I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start. I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel.

Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"this applies to all of austen's books. by the time you get to 'persuasion' you get pretty tired of it. same story lines, same themes, same devices. i read this book at the same time as dickens' 'dombey and son'. and after 200 pages of 'dombey', i never picked up 'persuasion' again. i got about half way through before i dumped dainty jane. there's just no comparison when you put them side by side. austen is really not so much a true novelist so much as she is some kind of prose playwright. her novels are really plays embellished by narrative descriptions of what people think and feel. they lack the full recreation of a physical world outside the minds of her characters. one is never even told something as basic as what her characters look like, much less how they dress, act or move. and one gets only the sketchiest descriptions of places and things, much as you'd find in a play. compare this to the rich and vivid imagery of dickens or flaubert or proust and it becomes obvious how far short of novels austen's books really fall. read any play and the resemblances to austen's books become all too apparent.still, austen is a good writer. she just isn't in the same class as the aforementioned great writers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"after reading P&amp;P and Northanger, i just couldn't slog my way through another of her books. but this one looked more interesting than any of her other works, so i thought, &quot;why not, i'll give it a try.&quot; big mistake. by far her worst (that i've read, but i still have emma and s&amp;s to go, and no plans on ever reading mansfield park). but i think it is safe to say i am not a fan of austen's. she's dull, and she turned an interesting idea into a dull book. i only gave her two stars instead of one because the premise behind the book was such a good one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth were happily in love and ready to be married - until Anne's friend Lady Russel persuades her that Captain Wentworth, a poor man in the army, is not the man for her. Eight years later, however, society brings them together again. Anne still loves him, and she must divulge if he still loves her, a hard task considering all the lovely young women who would do anything to marry the handsome and now wealthy Captain. Persuasion is a story filled with jealousy and uncertainty, as well as passion, simple joy, and a powerful, unconditional love.Persuasion is my third Austen novel (the first being Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility); I loved it. It kept me up late at night - midnight and later. I finished it in four days, which is a record for me as I do not read classics very quickly.In one word, I would say this is a simple book, in the best sense. It is written well and the way the events of the story are played out build the characters' personalities, their way of living. The story progresses in just a way that mirrors Anne's feelings for Wentworth... In the beginning, there is no word of a Captain Wentworth, and Anne's life is happy. At least, on the outside. As everything falls into place, however, Anne becomes more and more unnerved and unable to conceal her love, the love she's had all along. The tension between the Captain and Anne Elliot was substantial and realistic. I was very impressed and am every excited to read and re-read all of Austen's wonderful novels. They're sitting on my shelf...waiting!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Ms. Austen writes a fantastic story for the most part. The gossip was a little much at times. And the stereotypical situations and feelings were accurate even if a little annoying. The story flowed fairly well. I was impressed with keeping all the different characters and traits separate. Just a lot going on and different story lines. I was impressed with how much was in the book and everything was wrapped up neatly. Some things hadn't happened yet but you knew what was going to happen.I truly felt for Anne. She was trying to follow the influence of a friend since her mother was dead. I understand but she finally had to figure out for herself what was right and stick to it. Things seemed to go better now that she was older. Family and friends didn't fight things for her so much. Of her family members I loved her older sister Mary the best. She had her moments where she would get \\"sick\\" or get frustrated with her husband for making plans when plans were already made. But she had to learn to speak up as well. The women just kind of sat back and did nothing sometimes.All in all, I enjoyed the book. The drama was a little bit overwhelming but I had to find out how it ended. I wanted to know if Anne and Fredrick would end up together. I could see how things would all play out or at least how I hoped it would end up.

Again, I found nothing wrong with the format of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have never copied the title of my review from a different reader, but I did it this time. The title for this review comes from the letter that was written out by the hero. I LOVED THE LETTER, the most sensual love letter that I have ever read.Not even one kiss in this book, but while reading it, it is like you would take a deep breath and hold it until the end. Beautiful choice of words keeps your mind of state mesmerized. I loved the way that author wrote about every feeling or thought the heroine had in a presence of a man that she loved for so many years. Also, how she was in apprehension of an every meeting with him and weighting every word that he has said. The climax in the book was when he handed her the letter to pour his feelings buried inside for her. What a beautiful letter! The writer also has a great way to describe human nature. The writer grabs you with rich words.But the book is full of making acquaintances which was a bit too much for me in this book. But it is regency area after all."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What a surprise to find a character like Anne Elliot hiding between the pages of Persuasion. If you met Anne Elliot today, chances are you probably wouldn't remember her - but she would remember you -- so unused are we to being observed quietly and subtly. She is not a typical heroine, by modern standards, who speaks her mind freely and is a person of action. Elizabeth Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice comes to mind when I think of modern heroines -- outspoken and clever.What makes Anne Elliot a peculiar heroine is her ability to listen and observe -- two qualities most of us would consider rather passive. I find it interesting that at the opening of the book, Anne Elliot is described as a woman who is past the first bloom of youth and you get the sense that life is passing her by. But these qualities give Jane Austen the opportunity to capture the subtle inner workings of Anne Elliot's heart. Anne does not have beauty as a means of getting her way; the idea of having her own way to get would be unthinkable to her. So we are left to focus on her thoughts and feelings.So much in the book is left unsaid which in turn speaks volumes. It is quite delightful to find a character who is defined not only by the things they say but by the things they don't say; by what they do and the things they don't do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoy all of Jane Austen's novels but find this one to be my favorite. It is the most thoughtful and emotional and relies less on external events than the other novels. Anne Elliot is older than all of Jane Austen's other heroines. Her maturity shows in the way she handles her family's financial problems, her reunion with Wentworth, the events at Lyme, and the final happy moment when they reconcile. The ending was fulfilling and satisfying, and all that I could have hoped for, after, literally, reading Anne's thoughts."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Mrs. Croft's statement &quot;we women don't want to be in calm waters all our lives&quot; Jane Austen and her heroine, Anne Elliott, move beyond the domestic, from the bracing sea air of Lyme, to glimpses into the seafaring adventures of the Navy brethren. This to me is the predominate appeal of Persuasion - Anne, in her approaching maturity, is reunited with her former suitor in what we may expect is a deeper, more heartfelt love, having endured separation for so many years and she has the prospect of joining him at sea. My heart leaps to see her escaping domesticity and the dull social duties as exemplified by Sir Walter and her sister Elizabeth. Of course, Austen's use of language is perfect. My favourite Austen novel. The film adaptation with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds exquisitely captures the mood and characters of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've just finished reading 'Persuasion' and I loved it. At first glance Anne Elliot is somewhat of a doormat; then we learn that she is the only unselfish and rational member of her family, who has been putting their needs before hers for the last eight years and is finally sick of it. I was delighted at Jane's - whoops, I mean Anne's - rebellion against her position and her coming into her own as a woman deserving of love."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers of Jane Austen's Persuasion: this has to be one of her best works. The poignancy of the emotions throughout the novel were so present, so real. The writing drew me into the story, and I could hardly put the book down. Was the language too flowery? Not at all. It was beautiful. And I was quite sorry to see the words &quot;The End.&quot;There is something to be said about a book that captures the imagination and piques the curiosity. This book is one of them."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen at her best. The novel is most brilliantly thought out and beautifully presented. With romance at the forefront Austen nevertheless apprehends the task of presenting valuable life lessons. She achieves the intensity of the most gripping works, the light-heartedness of the most comical, and the wonder of the fantastic. This novel challenges whatever good lies dormant and inspires what's honorable in you. It also warms the heart."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found Persuasion to be the most mature of all Austen's works. The story of Anne Elliot's simple yet poignantly lost love (and final redemption)is heartfelt. The language, I think, is sophisticated and not pretentious. However, I think that most interesting aspect of this is that fact that when I read this book 20 years later, I will be able to feel its profoundity on yet another level."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot; How does Anne Elliot deal with her &quot;faded bloom?&quot; Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the 1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey, I decided to round out my Austen reading with Persuasion. About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century.Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance which burned brightly when the protagonists were younger and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen (if these people were real) afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice, how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and in Persuasion, how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own disfunctional family?) No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique is her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this &quot;critique of the family&quot; more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines. She is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know by reading any of Jane Austen's books of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows: &quot;(Anne and Captain Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.&quot;Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be - intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read - it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion. Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life. You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us. But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels. Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels. Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy. The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth. The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars. Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being \`persuadable' per se. Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality. Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men. This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency. The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters. Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women \`ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society. When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \\"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\\" Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of \`appearances.' In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it. It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've hated the fact that Persuasion isn't one of Jane Austen's most famous works ever since I read it. It is truly a beautiful love story, and it is written perfectly (as only Jane Austen could do).The story is about Anne Eliot, one of Austen's most likeable characters. Seven years before the novel begins, Anne had been persuaded out of a marriage to Frederick Wentworth. Neither Anne nor Captain Wentworth, had been persuaded out of love, though. Both have basically wasted the last seven years. Fortunately for the couple, circumstances arise which through them back together, and the two have to attempt to build a new relationship and deal with there own actions from years before.Persuasion is possibly Austen's greatest love story. It is much less satirical than here other novels. Anne is also a much more sympathetic character than say Emma. The novel is, of course, in Austen's incomparable style. Any romantic or lover of great literature would adore this beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This story is heart-wrenchingly agonising. This is a good thing! Never have I been so moved by a love story. When Anne and Captain Wentworth finally overcome their own guardedness and the pressures of society and re-declare their love for each other...... It is the most wonderful scene ever written. I have never read a more wonderful love story. I think this to be the most romantic of Jane Austen's novels. The mercenary marriage market Jane Austen ridicules in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is portrayed in a darker and more destructive light in &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Two lovers torn apart by a society fixated on class, wealth and position, only able to find happiness together once this obstacle has been overcome, but in the mean time..... OH THE HEART ACHE!!!!! I recommend this one for a rainy day when one can lie in bed, or sit in the favourite arm-chair, and wallow in the brilliance of this timeless and heart stirring romance. Don't forget your tissues!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of Jane Austen's lyrical prose, her timeless subjects of family relationships, love (and/or the search for it), her heartwarmingly drawn characters that I think any reader anywhere and at any time can relate to easily, and her usual witty and critical social commentary. I find it amazing to think that she wrote this novel nearly 200 years ago! I can think of several people in my own family and among friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who match her descriptions of Anne Elliot, her father and sisters Walter and Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove, Lady Russell, Captain Wentworth, etc. Times and mores may have changed in 200 years, but human nature has not changed! Reading her descriptions of these characters and well imagining Anne's reaction to them, whether it is with resignation, amusement, or exasperation mirror my own thoughts on them.Austen has created a wonderful character in Anne Elliot. I found that I liked her more and more as I read the novel, and, had she been real, would liked to have had her as a sister, friend, or relative. She is such a wonderful character because readers have a chance to see how she has grown up, has changed, and is willing to go for what she wants now that she is older and wiser (much like anyone else).The story is not like Austen's other novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma) because it deals with the issue of a true rarity in life--a second chance at love. Anne Elliot met and fell in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer, when she was 19 years old. Against her better judgment, she is \\"persuaded\\" by family in the form of family disapproval of her choice. Her mother is dead, her father and her elder sister Elizabeth (who have a very strange, almost-marriage-like relationship themselves) are social snobs and do not consider a mere captain in the British navy good enough to marry into their family because they are ranked above him socially. Anne's feelings, Frederick's feelings, and the possibility that he could earn a great deal of money by capturing privateers and enemy ships, or be rewarded with a title for distinguishing himself in battle does not occur to them. Anne is also strongly influenced by Lady Russell, a close family friend and a particularly close friend to Anne. Lady Russell, since the death of Anne's mother, has become a mother-figure/friend to Anne (since Anne is ignored by her father and sister Elizabeth). Lady Russell also disapproved of Anne marrying Captain Wentworth, and Anne, because she was young and easily influenced by those around her at age 19, breaks off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. She has regretted it ever since, and has not met anyone (her father and sister went out in Society, but did not take Anne with them; her younger sister Mary is married, but spends her time complaining about non-existent ailments and about all the wrongs and hurts she has suffered at the hands of family and friends to take any interest in introducing Anne to eligible young men) she would consider as a husband. Eight years pass, and, by chance, Captain Wentworth (now considerably wealthier though not titled) re-enters her life due to the temporary lull in the Napoleonic Wars. He too was very hurt by Anne's breaking off of their engagement, but, like Anne, he has not met any other women who compare to her. Both are wary of eachother--and Austen handles both their introspection and their gradual establishment of a stronger, more mature love for eachother with sensitivity and passion. I loved this story because it clearly shows an older (though still young) heroine who is offered the rarest of all things--a second chance at love with the love of her life. She is wise enough to reject the opinions of her family and Lady Russell this time, accepts the love offered, and offers her own love in return! Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne at the end of the novel is the kind of love letter every woman would cherish. Wow! What a beautiful letter! It warms your heart, touches your soul, and nourishes your spirit. The story is all the more poignant because Anne and Captain Wentworth appreciate eachother and their relationship because they know what they have and what they could have missed had they followed social conventions.For the die-hard Austen fans, there is plenty of social commentary, and I thought that Austen illustrated the snobbishness of the upper classes very well in her characterizations of Anne's father and sisters. The criteria they use to accept or reject a person are based on such things as whether the man owns property and how much, how many servants he has, title, family background, connections, and, in her father's case, physical appearance is very important. None of these things have any intrinsic value compared to whether Anne is loved and respected by Captain Wentworth, how he treats people, his ethics, morality, etc. Austen's subtle humor and way of poking fun at these values contribute to the tone of this novel.Give this novel a try. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is one of Jane Austen's five novels as a mature author. As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Persuasion\\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"and much better than her early novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \\"Emma.\\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favorite books -- and probably my favorite Austen, though I go back and forth between this and Pride and Prejudice. P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature. Definitely a book to read over and over. And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start.I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At the end of the day, Persuasion is worth reading because it offers a simple hope for how we can live together. Unlike, say Pride and Prejudice, where in the end the characters more collide than marry, the orbits of protagonists Anne and Captain Wentworth eventually come to revolve around each other.When I read Austen, I often wonder whether the author likes her characters. In Persuasion, it seems like the author strives to make her characters contest to find their proper standing, and neither breeding nor education (nor gender) determines the mettle of a man or woman. However, determining how we can live together, faults and all, is probably more important than the sort of personality and tribulation time trials that some of Persuasion's characters attempt to determine among themselves. More important is the comparison of the various family units, the Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves, and what a wise reader would learn from each.Make no mistake, this is no drawing room bodice ripper, of the \\"she slinked into the room scantily clad\\" variety. And its indolent upper class ever-vacationing denizens may appear quite impossible in today's society. However like occasional dessert, I found it better digested slowly, at the end of a day of intellectual toiling, rather than as a main course, or as a substitute for breakfast, lunch or dinner.I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this as a younger person. This is apparently the author's final work, and she did not live to see it published. So it is probably the artist at the height of her craft. If she left us with anything to think of how we might all get along, this is, in my estimation, it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"You know it's very difficult to choose which of Jane Austen's books it the greatest but I can say that this is one I re-read every couple of years. This, the last of Miss Austen's fabulous set of novels, is of the woman who was forced to give up her love and then never loved another. The heroine is more mature than those of her others books, not quite so insentive to others, nor as judgemental. Maybe the most exasperating aspect of this book is that you can see that once reunited, the two still love each other, but obey those deeply instilled lessons in behavior to the point that I find myself almost saying 'for goodness sake, just tell him you love him still'! But that wouldn't be a Jane Austen novel, for you'ld miss the ongoing narrative of families who behave even as families do today, and all of the love knots would not be tied only as neatly as this queen of the early novel could do. Oh, if only she had lived longer, but at least we still, almost 200 years later still have her masterpieces to read over and over!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen. She has so much wit and characteristics within her characters. For one, In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is apparent that a thinly disguised Jane Austen is the heroine. The romantic comedy is played fondly between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, but in this case, it is Anne Eliot and her former beau, Frederick Wentworth. Under &quot;persuasion&quot;, she is forced to lose her regard for him because of his low connections. Seven years past and he again re-enters her life when his sister and her husband rents Kellynch Hall, since Anne's father needed the money. She avoids meeting him, but when they had no choice in their accidental visits, he meets her with cold civility. He courts the rash and young Louisa Musgrove, but an unfortunate accident changes the direction of his eyes to fall upon Anne once more. As the begin a steady friendship, the ones they are involved with fall for others, and they reflect upon what they once had and have a pleasant life together. Anne might not appear as strong as most of Jane Austen's characters, but she still has the firm beliefs of the world and would not allow things such as vanity or fortune to stand in the way of her happiness."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me just start this review with that fact that I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan. I love the language and I think it's a shame that we don't speak like that anymore. However, this is not my favorite Austen book. There is not a lot going on in this book besides the pining of Anne Elliot and while I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. Although I do have to say that I LOVED the ending, which I won't go into cause I do not want to spoil anything for future readers. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading this book because Austen is great either way but for me personally this book was just a little underdeveloped in comparison to her other novels. Still a must read though for any Austen fan!!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, Jane Austen's last completed novel was written between 1815 and 1816, with final chapter revisions in August of that year. Published posthumously in late 1817 with her earlier work NORTHANGER ABBEY, each of the novels represents the alpha and omega of her writing career. Even though they are divergent in tone and topic, they each share a commonality in being partially set in Bath and display Austen's trademark play on social strata, money and courtship. Austen finished the manuscript of PERSUASION in declining health which may account for its slim size in comparison to her heftier previous efforts MANSFIELD PARK (1814) and EMMA (1816). Or, quite possibly it is exactly the length that she preferred for her story, allowing for a simpler plot and focus on fewer characters. Its size in no way diminishes it value. Some scholars consider it her finest achievement and readers have long cherished it for its jab at social mobility and moving love story.In 1817 Austen wrote to her niece Fanny Austen Knight in her usual ironic manner, \\"You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.\\" At age 27, Anne is not your typical Austen heroine. The middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot she is from a distinguished family of a landed Baronet. Her vain father takes their aristocratic ancestry and social position very seriously and expects his three daughters to make prominent matches. Quiet, reserved and not as pretty as her father values, Anne is often overlooked and her opinions dismissed by her family; \\"but Anne ... was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne.\\" Eight years prior Anne met and fell in love with a young naval officer Frederick Wentworth. Because he did not match her social and financial status, Anne was persuaded by a well meaning family friend to reject his marriage proposal. Wentworth returned to sea and forgets her. Anne never forgets him and remains unmarried. When he returns eight years later a wealthy and successful naval hero he reenters her social sphere with heightened status. On the other hand, Sir Walter's extravagant lifestyle has out paced his income to the point of serious debt and the family must retrench, let Kellynch Hall and remove to Bath. As Anne watches the younger ladies of the neighborhood swoon and play for Captain Wentworth's affections she is painfully aware of her lost bloom of youth, deeply regrets her decision and pensively longs for his favor until a tragic accident at Lyme Regis and events in Bath renew her hopes.In yet another brilliant reading of a Jane Austen classic novel, British actress Juliet Stevenson interprets Austen's poignant story of fidelity and second chances with wry humor and sensitive pathos. Her depth of characterization is remarkable and I am never in doubt that she is relaying Austen's intension faithfully. Those who have previously read the novel will find new enjoyment in this beautifully produced audiobook and those new to Austen's masterpiece will be treated to an unabridged eight hours and forty three minutes of pure perfection. Such equal blending of masterful story and artistic integrity is rarely encountered and I highly recommend it.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Sometimes there's nothing better than settling in with an old favorite. Austen's Persuasion is a story of rediscovering what is lost. More than lost, what was let go. With her apt view of society of the day, the story still bears out all these years later."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Just what you'd expect from a Jane Austen novel. Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it. By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine. She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters. A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a very good book. It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all). Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary. It's a story of delayed love and patience. It's been called her 'most romantic.' The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic. It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As an avid fan of Jane Austen, I began reading \\"Persuasion\\" with great expectations. Although I cannot say I am dissapointed, I must admit I did not like Persuasion as much as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility.First of all, although I sympathized with Anne when he was slighted by her own family and she was taken no notice of in the company of foolish women just because she is not as pretty and \\"fragile\\" as them, maybe because she is not as strong and passionate a character as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, I could not particularly attach myself to her. Still, I read the novel from beginning to the end in a very short time because it has more than enough to keep our interest. Especially the character of Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth is worth notice; because among the \\"ailing\\" and \\"fatigued\\" women of the higher classes of that time, this woman who walks long distances with her husband, who accompanies him on long sea journeys and takes the reins of their carriage to manoeuvre out of the way of a post is very interesting. In this novel, Jane Austen says quiet a lot of things which can be thought quiet feministic. Well she says similar things in P&P;, for example she makes Darcy say that Elizabeth's complexion is greatly improved after a long walk, when Bingley's sisters criticize her for such an unlady-like behaviour.Another thing about the novel is that we don't really know the feelings of Captain Wentworth. It is true that the letter he writes to Anne at the end is full of love but I didn't feel his passion as I did Darcy's when he proposed to Elizabeth the first time.All in all, I recommend the book to readers who have read Austen's other novels. But as a first read it may not be so enjoyable as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Though not as well known as the novels that established the author's name (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), Persuasion is certainly worth your time. It's extremely well-written with superb characterization. The plot isn't too original by today's standards, but is interesting nonetheless. Anne Elliot, the smartest and most pleasant by far of three upper class sisters, is 28 and still single. At 19 she fell in love with and almost married a dashing naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. However, great pressure from her family and relations &quot;persuaded&quot; her to reject Frederick due to his lower station in society. Frederick was greatly hurt and promptly went off to engage his energies in naval action.Eight and a half years later, Anne still hasn't met another guy she likes as much as Frederick and remains single. But now Frederick returns from war, retired, extremely wealthy from privateering with mercenaries, and more mature. He's ready to settle down and a chance family connection puts him back in the same neighborhood as Anne! He's still upset with Anne. And this time, other women are catching his eye too...While not up to the standards of Anne Bronte's outstanding The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Persuasion is a good classical romance novel. I think it beats out Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd on plot and characterization, though Hardy's prose is generally more powerful. Nevertheless, Austen can be quite poignant when she wants to be: Wentworth's shocking letter to Anne at the end of the book moved even me, a generally left-brained emotionless creature!A highlight of the novel is the illuminating social commentary that Austen subtly inserts into the prose. Clearly, she felt that the class system entrenched in British society at the time had its shortcomings. The endnotes in the Penguin edition do a good job of explaining the finer points of Austen's many jabs at class-conscious folks including Anne's self-absorbed father Walter and hopeless sister Elizabeth. Anne's other sister Mary is rendered superbly by Austen as a basically good-natured woman unfortunately marred by a touch of vanity. I personally know a Mary or two.Recommended to all adult readers!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion. True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written. It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book. It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed. There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"i've read this book twice, and it has highly recommended itself both the times. its a more mature work of jane austen perhaps it being her last book.anne elliot, the heroine is reserved, elegant and reflective ..she had fallen in love with a very desirable young man, wentworth, but his connections and moreso his position in society made it not all desirable for anne's beloved friend, lady l to allow her to continue her relationship.now 7 years later they meet again to renew their love and affection; he being a captain now and possessing a large enough fortune. though at first he receives the attentions of louisa musgrove and anne the attentions of her cousin, mr. elliot, the heir to her father, they soon come to realise that what felt from the heart is the truest meaning of love. with the help of her many friends anne soon returns the affections she once held for captain wentworth."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although the social formulas are not compatible with the present times, I was moved by the power of the emotions and the psychology of all the characters.

Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I chose this reading because I am a Jane Austen fan and have not read Persuasion since in high school. Her style is definitely refreshing for that period of time."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A charming story.

My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's novels are characterized by their limited plot and their freedom from deep philosophical musings, complicated image patterns and symbolism. As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \\"nice\\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's *Persuasion* was her last book before she suddenly, unfairly died, and it is profoundly different than her earlier works.In this book, Anne Elliot, the protagonist, is past the bloom of her youth, all of 27 years old. She gave up the love of her live, Captain Wentworth, when she was twenty because she was persuaded that he was not socially a proper match for her. Considering the vast importance of a proper match, or a good match, in Jane's earlier works (such as *Pride & Prejudice* in which Lizzy Bennet, who is essentially penniless and perhaps soon to lose her home, makes the ultimate \\"good match\\" in which she marries Pemberly, er, Mr. Darcy) it is interesting in this book how Jane examines the results of declining a socially and economically imprudent match. Anne Elliot's life is blighted when she gives up love merely because Wentworth is not enough for her. She becomes an old maid. This book is an admonition to the flighty young girls who sought \\"good matches\\" at the expense of love. It's a grown-up's book.*Persuasion* also funny as all heck. That first sentence, \\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt,\\" is a damning statement about people who don't read good literature, but only read books of mere facts, like the Peerage. Anne's older sister is just as daft and great for an eye-rolling laugh.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite). This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.Let's begin with a summary. Anne Elliot fears life as an \\"old maid\\" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married. She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth. At the time, he was not considered suitable. Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect. Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth. Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her. Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him. The question now is does he feel the same way? This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons. First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man. Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character. Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics. However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them. I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time. She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves. She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us. I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways. Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way? Austen was an early psychologist of her time and really understands human behavior. I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself. It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem. I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many would have Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; determine her status as one of the greatest of all novelists; however, this critic will always stand by the quiet and profound maturity that defines this lovely masterpiece &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Here the characters are all terribly human and flawed and the narrative so touching without ever resorting to maudlin prose. There is an underlying sadness in this book which tells the reader that at some point in her life, Jane Austen loved deeply. This book is a celebration of that love; indeed, she would not have felt comfortable mourning it before her family or her readers. Therefore, instead of indulging in self-pity, Austen gratifies the soul by telling the story of one woman who refuses to sacrife her integrity and &quot;secures&quot; the man she loves in her way and in her time. This is more than a great read; it is truly a magnificent work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"8 years has passed since the break up of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth. Because of Frederick's lack of fortune and connections at the time, Anne was persuaded to reject his proposal. Now, he's back into town, with a fortune amassed at sea and still single. The feelings that were never quenched on Anne's side, are burning stronger than ever. And it has been turned upside down with (now) Captain Wentworth's renewed presence. Sure, she still wants him. But she's not sure if he does! Especially with the Musgrove sisters now in the picture. Not that she's lacking for suitors, but they just pale in comparison with Capt. W!What a classic. Jane Austen, 200 years ago had the romance and chemistry right. Even for an ordinary girl like Anne who had let love pass by her once! Oh the suspense. You didn't know which Musgrove sisters Captain W was going to choose... let alone be sure if he even harbored any feelings for Anne! Or was Anne going to fall for the smooth and suave Mr. Elliot, her cousin? But all the waiting was worth it. Oh, the letter that he writes to Anne at the end is so worth it! I think the romance between Anne and Capt. Wentworth rivals any of the contemporary romance stories."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austenites such as myself dive in most willingly and blissfully into her stories. We bask in the sway of waves bearing her lively pitch, her precise and playful interaction with the language - and we bemusedly acknowledge that such magic has never even yet come close to being rejuvenated by anyone, despite so many attempts made within the some 200 years since her novels were written.PERSUASION quaintly commences on a quiet country estate in Regency England, and on a fanciful whim journeys on through to the seaside resort of Lyme, thence onward through the social promenade of Bath. The story follows Anne Elliot, daughter of snobby baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter, in between older sister Elizabeth, the apple of her father's eye, and married younger sister, Mary Musgrove. Jane Austen makes very good use of her exquisite wit in the depictions of shallow, haughty Elizabeth and selfish, frivolous Mary.Anne, however, is cut from a different cloth. Having fallen in love at age 19 or 20 with a handsome young man of no fortune, Anne denies her passion for what she sees as her duty and breaks her engagement with Frederick Wentworth - after, of course, some persuasion from Lady Russell, a friend of her late mother. Then, some eight years later, after Anne has apparently lost her youthful bloom, Captain Wentworth returns - still very handsome, and now quite rich after having made his fortune in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.As Captain Wentworth brandishes warm, flirtatious attention upon the young, lively Musgrove sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, sisters of Mary's husband Charles, Anne silently harbours the certainty that her deep affection and love for Wentworth had never faded despite all those years apart from him, and that his aloofness bears witness that his feelings for her have forever disappeared. She all the while keeps those pangs of loss and regret subdued, and stays steadfast in her knowledge of what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others. After her father's frivolity with money has necessitated moving his family to Bath and leasing out his estate, Kellynch hall, Anne must search for her place in the world.Although PERSUASION may not be the wittiest, nor the liveliest, nor the brightest or most luminous of the six novels written by Jane Austen, one cannot deny that it is perhaps the most moving. Our heroine's allure takes the reader gently into that era of innocent romance, that beautiful country where sometimes what once had been lost might inexplicitly, almost magically, be found...if sought."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"&quot;Persuasion&quot; was Jane Austen's last novel, and the more sober and pensive quality of the book, as compared to some of her earlier works, most notably &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, reflects her maturity both in age and as a writer; no one in their early 20's could have written this book. The heroine of &quot;Persuasion&quot; is Anne Elliot, seven years after she rejected, at her family's insistence, the young man she had fallen in love with at 19, when he was just starting a naval career and was too poor, in the eyes of her pretentious relatives, to be considered acceptable marriage material. Now he has returned, financially secure and promoted to captain, and she finds herself still in love with him. Without giving away the rest of the plot, the book gives a powerful argument for following one's heart instead of the prejudices and snobbisms of society. Anne does not have the same appeal to many modern readers as Elizabeth Bennet; she is more shy, retiring and reflective. But as the book progresses and she finds the strength to act on her feelings, she grows in personality and character. This final work by one of the greatest writers (and my personal favorite) in the English language is a lasting testimony to her incredible talents as a novelist."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the last novel that Jane Austen finished before she died. Had she lived longer, it might have been a longer book. But It is a piece of jewel that I enjoyed very much.Our heroine Anne,when she was nineteen years old was persuaded to give up the only man she ever loved because he had no money and could only offer her an uncertain future as a sailor's wife. Captain Wentworth comes back eight yers later, successful and rich looking for a wife. Jane Austen weaves her magin threads and the story unfolds with unforgettable characters and final union of two people who had loved each other all these years inspite of social prejudice and class difference.Of all leading men in her books, Captain Wentworth is the most dashing man with his good looks, intelligence and fearlessness of a strong man who knows his own value inspite of social injustice.This is the kind of book to read over and over again. and every time you read, Jane Austen will take you to the charming regency time in Bath."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"While more expensive versions may have slightly better readers this version was overall a great value."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, this is Jane Austen's greatest book. Anne Elliot is a beautifully written character, and Austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills. Many critics have declared that Austen's greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant, and I think this novel is the best showcase for that talent. Though often not as comical as some of her other works, this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers, and the dialogue (always done well by Austen) is superb. What makes this novel stand-out in my mind, is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books (though it is of course still present), it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love, even in the best-mannered of individuals.For those wondering what exactly makes Austen a truly classic author, and not just a fun feminine writer, I suggest a close reading of Persuasion."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persusion is the story of Anne Elliot, a girl trapped in a classic example of listening to bad advice.Anne falls for the charming Captain Wentworth, and after many sunny days spent toghether, the couple decides to marry.When Anne tells this to her dear and only friend, Lady Russell, she is informed that he is too poor and far below her status as a daughter of a baronet. After succumbing to Lady Russell's persuasion, a broken-hearted Anne ends the engagement. The miserable pair then goes their separate ways.Eight years later, the Elliots are struggling for money and decide to lease their house and move to Bath,leaving Anne with her sister Mary. Who should be their new tenant, but Cpt. Wentworth's brother. Anne and Wenworth are soon thrown together again. This begins a journey of reconciliation, leaving the reader with the constant question,\\"Will they forgive their past and rekindle their love?\\"I thought this was an excellent literary classic that truly captures the point and makes a great romance without being sappy or the characters being shallow. I would recommend this book for middle school on up, and primarily for girls. I can't picture many males sitting still for this one. The characters are perfectly molded, and some, like Sir Walter are humorous and very entertaining.I would give Persusion 5 stars and 2 thumbs for an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The subject of unlikely love is one we will never grow tired of, and as long as that is true, Jane Austen is an author we will always treasure. She always gives us such enthralling glimpses into live in nineteenth century England that we can little help but wish ourselves back to a time when love was courtly and appearances were everything. Somehow, she knew that love went beyond her society's rules. She knew that rank and name were not enough to silence love. In PERSUASION, she gives us all that she gave us in Pride and Prejudice. We shake our heads at the embarrassing families, yearn for the hero and heroine to admit their feelings to each other, and long for the man who causes trouble between the heroes to just go away. But, this time, not only do we have the suitor who keeps the man of our heroine's dreams at a distance, we have a malicious sister. We see Anne struggle with internal and external pressures while she deals with the seemingly outright malice of her sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is mean! She is not indifferent or aloof, but downright nasty and greedy. Her sister's happiness is something she would rather not see until her own is firmly in place, and she seems like the type to use sabatoge to succeed. I, for one, will never tire of reading of the ups and downs of a forbidden or unlikely love, and always feel a sense of exultation when the dashing man and striking young woman finally feel free enough to admit their feelings to one another, despite the dirty looks their pairing may draw."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Having read all of Jane Austen's books, I've been very impressed with her style. Reading Persuasion, I immediately noticed the difference between shy Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's other characters: Emma, Elinor and Marianne, Elizabeth Bennet, Fannie Price, and Catherine Morland. Anne is not the most beautiful, the cleverest, or the most-spirited. She is shy, quiet, thoughtful, somewhat plain, and honest. She reacts to emergency situations calmly and clearly, proving that she does have a backbone. I think the fact that she is older and more mature than Austen's other characters shows a maturity in Austen's writing. I highly recommend this book to those who love Jane Austen and can understand being shy and strong."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"is Austen's novel which begins with Anne Elliot thinking about a lost love instead of a future love.Beautifully written, it is a novel that makes readers wonder if there is going to be the \\"characters meet and finally get married\\" ending that is so typical in Austen novels. Anne Elliot is 27, unmarried, and living at home with her father and older unmarried sister who are concerned about appearing more wealthy than they actually are. When the family is convinced by Lady Russell to rent out their home and move to a more economical space, Anne ends up going to care for her younger sister Mary Musgrove.Anne's visit with her sister's family becomes uncomfortable once Captain Wentworth becomes a frequent visitor there. Wentworth is the love that Anne regretfully let slip away, having been influenced by her good friend Lady Russell that his social status was inferior to Anne's. Wentworth and Anne are both convinced that their relationship is over and their communication with one another is formal, yet limited.Anne is not sure what to make of Captain Wentworth's interest with Louisa and Henrietta (Charles Musgrove's sisters), and more than one gentleman takes a romantic interest in Anne. Both Anne and Wentworth distance themselves from each other in an attempt to forget that they ever loved each other.It is when Anne is away from Wentworth, and at home with her father and sister that she begins to realize how much she loves Wentworth. She wonders if she is too late, if the chance for love has really passed. Even though she loves Wentworth, Anne is still concerned about what her father and Lady Russell will think of him.Readers can only speculate as to the ending of the novel, which appears to be more uncertain than the endings in Austen's other novels. The art of persuasion, as well as social status, and the contrasting views of the elders and the youth, makes this novel one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's another great book of Jane Austan.

She brings an asperity to the text often missing in film adaptations of Jane Austen. Anne Elliott, unlike Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny or Emma, is older and the novel has a subtle autumnal quality, which, of course, gives way to spring in end.

It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think \\"of that person\\" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth. The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first JA book I've ever read, I really enjoyed it, and not in small part because of the footnotes, and discussion included in this penguin edition.

That is what Anne Elliot does. Frederick Wentworth is a dashing naval officer, but well beneath Anne's station. She is, after all, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, baronet and master of Kellynch Hall. Not only is Wentworth a penniless officer, he is also ambitious and confident. According to Anne's particular friend Lady Russell, those qualities are unbecoming in a man. And so, out of safety, Anne severs her engagement to Wentworth. Fast-forward eight years. Anne is now twenty-seven, still single, still disinclined to marry. Her father has little money and is now forced to let Kellynch Hall to a well-respected admiral. Among the admiral's society is Anne's former fianc&eacute;, now Captain Wentworth, well respected and very rich. Anne's love for Wentworth reemerges, but is it too late? Is his indifference so big that he won't even speak to her? Could she somehow persuade him to give their love another try?This is Jane Austen's final finished work. It was published in 1818, one year after her death. Persuasion is a masterpiece and my second favorite Austen (after Pride and Prejudice). This novel contains Austen's signature comedy of manners, but it's not her funniest effort. It is, however, her most romantic. Whose heart doesn't break when Anne watches Wentworth court both the Musgrove sisters, and listens to her sister and brother-in-law argue over who Wentworth should choose to be his bride? Who hasn't choked up with The Letter? (Persuasion fans know what I'm talking about.) This is the third -- or is it the fourth? -- time I read this book, and I still tear up when I read that bit! Persuasion is a wonderful novel, but it isn't perfect. Various secondary characters are either one-dimensional or underdeveloped, and I would have liked the scenes in Lyme to be expanded, for those are my favorite scenes. Alas, if you're an Austen fan, there is plenty of her signature stuff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside. I like that this novel is partly set in Bath, giving it the genuine Regency setting that makes Jane Austen unique. If you've never read Persuasion, I cannot persuade you to read this enough! And if you've read this and are a fan, may I perhaps persuade you to read it again?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although also a romance like Austen's better known novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is a subtle one, with a theme not of whirlwind passion but of constancy and devotion. The main character, Anne Elliott, was very much in love with Captain Wentworth as a young girl, but was persuaded by friends and family to reject him as a husband. Broken-hearted, Wentworth went to sea, and the novel actually begins when he re-enters Anne's life eight years later, having made his career and his money.Anne is a character to whom the reader can easily relate: introspective, analyzing everything and flawed, able to make make mistakes and recover from them. She narrowly averts an unhappy life by not letting her friends and family persuade her again to marry her cousin, who has money and manners but turns out to be quite despicable. And while Captain Wentworth does not have the dash or charm of a Mr. Darcy, he is Anne's one true love, as prone to the follies of a broken heart as she is subject to the strong influence of those around her.The underlying theme is about choices and following one's heart. If Anne had only listened to her own feelings instead of allowing others to sway her, she would have found happiness sooner. Despite what seems like an afterthought of a speech at the end of the novel, when Anne justifies her earlier behavior, this seems to be a strongly feminist novel, advocating the rights of women to choose their own way in life and their own partners for life, rather than be guided solely by considerations of fortune and class.This is also one of Austen's funnier novels, particularly the scenes featuring Anne's sisters and father, who are incredibly self-absorbed. Their dialogue--constantly misreading the situation in their own favor or stating something when the opposite is true--brings a welcome lightheartedness to the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm persuaded to find this a most charmingly written story.

Having loved that novel so dearly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from another Jane Austen novel. Would nothing else ever measure up or could this author surpass even her own writing genius? In this reader's eyes, neither of these extremes occurred with \\"Persuasion.\\" It most definitely had its romantic moments. Captain Wentworth's culminating profession of love to heroine Anne make that case better than I ever could: \\"You pierce my soul. I am half agony and half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. ... I have loved none but you.\\" Nonetheless, this novel and its characters still rank inferior to Mr. Darcy and Lizzy in my eyes.

My favorite Austen novel is Persuasion.After the heroine, Anne Elliot, was talked into leaving the man she loved, an attractive and financially challenge man named Frederick Wentworth, she felt she couldn't possibly marry a poor man. Eight years later, however, Wentworth returned to his homeland with a fortune and a place in society. It is obvious that those were the times in which social status was the most important thing, not love. Jane Austen had created a beautiful story that people can still relate to.

I think it would probably have to be this one. Maybe it was because I had already had a little practice with Pride? I don't know. But this one, to me, seemed to be a love story from the start, and also seemed to be much sweeter, somehow. But I'm not sure what it was that struck me closer to the heart, because Pride was just as much so...wasn't it? Anyway, if you want to read the classics, and can get past the old english, which to me is kind of elegant, then give this a try. It is a good read, after all..."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's no Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the style is strained and nearly unbearable for the first ten or twelve chapters. I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Beautiful story, have read it many times and will continue to do so, love Jane Austin the title tells the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan.

Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes. Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne. Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne. As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money. And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted. Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again? The answer lies in the story.Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels. The novel speaks of the \\"great war\\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections. Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love. But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family. And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't. Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court. And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \\"utmost decorum.\\"\\"It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\" (Austen 197).Foreshadow is prominent in the novel. In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters. It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \\"money, money was all that he wanted\\" (Austen 178). After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \\"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\\" (Austen 44). Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.Although \\"Proper English\\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage. Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship. Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked. Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am not quite sure why Persuasion is not quite as good asSense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice. It is a well constructedstory, and if anything, the secondary characters are more amusingthan those in her other novels. However, the main charactersare just too restrained (maybe repressed is a better wordhere). Their exchanges, and frequently lack thereof, makes it a bitfrustrating. However, this is still an excellent read - entertainingfrom start to finish."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Everyone else has said all there is to say about Austen, her writing, and this plot. I want to thank Penguin Classics for the endnotes in this edition. They were comprehensive, clear, attractively presented (instead of being wedged into the text), and helpful to 21st-century readers of this early 19th-century novel. The scholarly introduction (with a spoiler warning, how thoughtful!) and the biographical timeline help place the book in both literary and chronological context, and were substantive additions to this work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This novel, written by the mature Jane Austen and published after her death, reveals the strengths of Austen's art. First, she is a careful and exact observer of human character, as compared to those that base a novel of emotion or behavior. Second, she is totally aware of class distinctions and the determinism that is created by a rigid class structure. She explores how character is independent of class but often mistakenly associated with upper class persons. Third, Austen is also a comedic writer, full of wit and funny portrayals of hypocrites, though many may find fault with my interpretation below since this aspect of Austen's art is rarely discussed. Fourth, Austen carefully portrays the world of 17th century upper class women which could be viewed as oppressive, paternalistic, and deterministic. However she continually portrays women as resilient actors rather than victims.She was a superb observer and interpreter of human character. This is different from those contemporary authors who are more likely to explore emotion and behavior. Character in the work of Austen is destiny and good character eventually leads to better outcomes and poor character leads to worse outcomes. Whereas at times her characters exhibit emotion, they are more likely to withhold emotion and when this withholding is done carefully and discretely, Austen would see this as signs of good character. Whereas she has high regard for honesty, she seems to see honesty as having both a proper method of presentation and to have proper timing in order to have impact. The letter Captain Wentworth writes to Anne Elliott at the end of the novel is a perfect example of suppressed emotion transformed into carefully strategically timed truth-telling.Class differences play and huge role in the works of Austen and Persuasion explores this with the romance of a rich girl of noble family in love with a handsome but middle class young man who both have reversal of fortune and 8 years later re-encounter each other. Anne Elliott is surrounded by a father, two sisters, and her deceased mother's best friend; all of whom use social class as a cognitive short hand for who is worthy and who is not. Anne is the character that can penetrate the smoke of social class to see the true strengths of character underneath. Interestingly, when Persuasion was written, the Napoleonic wars were over and many young men who made their fortunes in the British navy returned with fortunes into English society. Here the new rich encounter the old landed rich, a formula for social upheaval. Austen perfectly articulates this as the Elliott family vacates their ancestral home, Kellynch, and rent the mansion to an Admiral and his wife.Austen was witty and could be considered a comedic writer. Her descriptions of human folly, prejudice, snobbery, and hypocrisy are all skillfully handled. She never preaches. She allows the snob, the fool, the hypocrite to reveal themselves through their speech and interactions. The outburst of Anne's father, Sir Elliott, upon hearing this his daughter is visiting a sickly poor school friend instead of visiting barely know distant rich relatives is priceless.In summary, Austen's Persuasion is a good example of Austen's considerable skill at character analysis and revelation and development of character in social interactions and social contexts. She is delightful to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading. It is necessary to read it at least twice, and preferably more.It's not as immediately pleasing as some of Ms. Austen's other works, Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility etc., but those who take the time to appreciate this book will find it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Wow! Last night I stayed up to 2:00 am, determind to finish this book. I could not last the whole night without wondering the ending, whether it be happy or sad. And so, I finished my first Jane Austen book. I loved this book and everything in it. The characters were amazing!! If you haven't read this book you're missing out!! Now, if you are still in question as to whether you have the ability to read such a book, no worries! Just pick this book up and READ it!! You won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have now read all of Austen's completed works and wrote reviews for all them as well ^-^. (I'm feeling very proud of myself by now) It's not my favorite, but it's definitely not the worst. And for Jane Austen, even the worst is an enjoyable, entertaining read; I only mean the worst compared to her other novels not on a general scale.To get down to the book, it was quite different from the others. Anne is twenty-eight at the start of the book, she is plain and unattractive having lost her \`bloom' seven years earlier due to the loss of her love, and isn't as witty and sparkling as Elizabeth Bennet or Emma. Yet you don't come to despise her; she's not weak. And when you come to think of it, her agreeing to break off her engagement with the hero was a wise thing to do at her age. If he hadn't acquired a great fortune or perhaps died in service, then where would she be? Plus the fact that she was young and smothered with disapproval all around and the woman she thought of as her mother was dead against the match.So anyway, she also has the most despicable family out of any of Austen's other novels-even Mansfield Park-they are conceited, selfish and self-important. The sad thing is that you realize that people like Sir Walter really exist, people who care solely for appearances and rank. Even Anne's sister Mary, perhaps the nicest sister, is selfish without really meaning it, and treats Anne the way a spoiled child treats it's parents; nicely when it wants something, but all the while thinking: what else do they have in their lives to do but to cater to all my whims?There are a few trivial things I didn't like: first that Sir Walter Elliot is such a snob; Walter is my absolute favorite name! Austen gave it a pretty bad impression. Secondly, I wish that James could have married Anne; I really liked him, much better than the hero, and he suited her so well! I didn't really like the hero of this book; I'm a sucker for the rich, dashing gentlemen of her other novels. You don't really know the hero of this book so well.Anyway, like all her books, the prose is outstanding, her usage of the language remarkable and the reader's attention is never lost; Austen's greatest gift. I have always loved Austen's style of writing, it's great! Great book, highly recommended! Add it to your classics shelf. Don't have one? Get one!!!=^-^="},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a big fan of Austen's, I read this book and wasn't disappointed. All of Austen's trademarks are there: her witty commmentary of the British elite, silly men and women who both exasperate and amuse you, and a good love story. Persuasion is about Anne Elliot, who after breaking off an earlier engagement with Captain Wentworth, is suddenly in his company 8 years later, and longing to rekindle the romance. This book wasn't as fun as Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the struggle between Anne and Wentworth doesn't resonate the same way as that between Elizabeth and Darcy. Neither characters are particularly arrogant (though Wentworth is hostile at being rejected before), but it's still interesting to see how the two will find one another among the silliness of the people and situations around them. Jane Austen just has a way of keeping her reader in suspense, no matter if you feel sure you know the ending. The question is always How will they get together rather than if, and the How here will please any romantic reader satisfactorily."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter onto my Kindle and yes, the line breaks are strange. It does not read flush left to flush right, but rather like poetry in couplets. Which is ironic, given how poorly poetry line breaks are done on many e-readers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen created a literary treasure with this book. The story has all the the usual Austen charms, yet also deals with lost love, age and family pressures. Anne and Wemtworth are qonderful charecters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"All of Jane Austen's heroines are unique in different ways; Emma Woodhouse was rich and had no pressing need to marry; Fanny Price was shy and introverted; Lizzie Bennett was witty and self-mocking; and Elinor Dashwood had to share the spot-light with her younger sister Marianne. Anne Elliot's defining attribute is that she is considerably older than her literary fellows; for at the grand old age of twenty-seven is nearly past her prime (in the eyes of her contemporaries) and entering perpetual spinsterhood. In a time when a woman was defined by her society almost solely on her success in marriage, things are not looking so good for Anne.This is especially bitter for Anne considering she was once in love with the handsome but poor Frederick Wentworth, but persuaded to break relations between them on the advice of her deceased mother's dearest friend Lady Russell, who disapproved the match. Regretting such an action in the years that followed, Anne has almost reconciled herself to a life of maidenhood, surrounded by self-absorbed relatives.However, fate is about to give her a second chance. Set (and written) as the Napoleonic Wars were ending, Anne learns that Captain Wentworth - now a wealthy and respectful officer - is about to re-enter her acquaintance. After her father is forced to rent out their estate in order to pay off debts, Anne travels to Uppercross Cottage to stay with her sister Mary Musgrove, unsettled with the thought that one of the tenants left behind is the sister of Captain Wentworth. Settling in with the Musgroves and the beautiful Henrietta and Louisa (Mary's sister-in-laws), it is only a matter of time before Mr Musgrove returns with Captain Wentworth in tow.Anne is understandably nervous given their unhappy parting, but forces herself to remain calm and polite in his presence - and to her sorrow he behaves the same toward her, focusing his attention on the Musgrove girls. To stir things up a bit, Anne also meets her estranged cousin Mr Elliot, who is immensely attentive and charming toward her and almost certainly intends to make her his wife.Anne herself is neither pretty nor witty; rather she's patient, kind-hearted, sensible and part of a family that doesn't deserve her. It's not that her father and sisters are unkind, but one can feel Anne's discontent and loneliness in being part of a family that places importance only on riches and rank without any conception that their minds are weak and uninformed. As the only sensible person in a world of self-absorption, Anne trudges through her duties unnoticed and uncomplaining. But she's not perfect, for every reader knows that she's made a mistake in giving up the love of her life (though she comes to a surprising conclusion concerning it in the last chapter, placing her duty to society and family above the demands of her own heart), and as Frederick and Anne dance around each other, hopelessly trapped by the silence that conformity demands, the modern reader will share their frustration in their inability to speak their minds, especially in a world where there are no such restrictions.But of course, this is an Austen book and you don't have to be physic to know that a happy resolution is on its way - but the way in which it is settled is perhaps Austen's most touching union between two characters, made even more poignant by the fact that that it's taken them two tries to find one another. One feels especially happy for Anne, who truly deserves some joy in her life - her reaction to the warmth of the Musgroves' familial life is heartrending when you realise her surprise and appreciation for it is caused by the lack of such warmth in her own family.\\"Persuasion\\" is the shortest of all Austen's novels, as well as the last one she wrote before her death, which should appeal to those who are a bit stretched for time. It's not her best, most beloved or most famous novel, as many of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for. A sweet, slim novel about loyal, love and second chances."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first time I read this book. I know it's a classic and all that, but I really enjoyed it. It was a bit hard to get into right away, but once all the players were introduced I was hooked.

By far it is the best Jane Austin book for me. The plot is fabulousand it touches each one of us and we all wish that Anne finds her happines."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book, on first round, didn't blow me away. Unlike other Austen's, it wasn't full of young and overwhelming love. However, the more I pondered it and reread it, the more I enjoyed its honesty. The main storyline moves slowly but surely and I found myself invested in each decision made, willing the characters to bend to my will. Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Yet another great story by Ms. Austin. Although Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite, Persuasion is a wonderful story of young love, heartbreak, pride, and reconciliation. Well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is as good as my Grandmother told me it was. I didn't really want to read it as I didn't think it was my thing.

(So many commas.) But as I began to get into the story it held me entralled. I could easily visualize the characters and relate to their feelings. The discriptions are so appealing of the countryside in which the story takes place. Ms Austen paints a broad picture with her words.I found it very hard to put down. I wasn't sure that I could enjoy this book on the Kindle but found it just as engrossing as a hard cover book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels.

I highly recommend everyone read this, it's a quick read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the third book by Austen I forced my way through, but I must admit, I find her writing dry, humorless, dull, and always the same themes. It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoy this book and read it about once a year. This book is hard to describe, and I don't know why I like it: I just know I do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Chinese water torture? Sounds like a welcome diversion from this boring redundant work of &quot;art&quot; to me. I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime &quot;soap&quot;. In conclusion, not only do I NOT recommend this novel, but I pledge to do my best to begin an anti-Persuasion League, to prevent the widespread development of narcolepsy in high school students who are forced to read worthlessly painful novels."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I must say Jane Austen is incredibly boring and all her novels are stories of women's aspirations to marry wealthy and noble men to support them. Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also, it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is perhaps my favorite Austen novel. As with all of her others, I have read it many times, and am delighted all over again with each re-reading. Jane Austen's wit and deep understanding of human nature have charmed readers for 200 years."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many readers who start with Austen's longer, more complex works, quickly get overwhelmed and throw up their hands in frustration. Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to &quot;persuade&quot; her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me. I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and straighforward. This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at first with a myriad of relatives and relationships. But at its core it is a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her. It is not merely a good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of those, and a lovely read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, like other Jane Austen novels, contains characters who are class conscious to the point of being absolutely ridiculous. Anne is the most sensible one of the bunch. She decided that these class distinctions are less important than helping an old friend. Sir Walter Elliot and his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, are completely willing to associate with those of a higher class than themselves but will avoid people of a lower class. They avoid anything that would ruin their image. Mary, the other Elliot daughter, is just as selfish but in a slightly different way. Jane Austen's dialogue is difficult to follow at times, but worth the extra work it takes to understand the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every time I finish another Austen novel, it becomes my &quot;favorite,&quot; and Persuasion is no different. Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase. Anne Elliot is a heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy and affection. If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of pleasure and enjoyment. Persuasion in indeed a rare and priceless gem."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book came into my life at a time I really needed it. Perhaps that makes me partial to it, but I found it compelling, compassionate, and greatly moving. Not a general reader of Austen, but compelled to pick it up after viewing the movie, I was impressed with it's insight and its emotional and social commentary. But more than social commentary it is, though to some it may sound trite, a book of the heart and soul. For me it was spiritually cleansing and emotionally purifying. A book of beauty and love, a work which has become a personal favorite."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish Persuasion, a revelation in itself because the first time I picked up the book during my vacation in Jamaica, I barely comprehended it and couldn't get into it and ended up putting it down in exchange for one of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery. I decide to start it from the very beginning, and after about five hours decided I would risk not being able to get up on time in the morning just to see how it all turns out.Jane Austen's books, I've decided, is a little like watching a Shakesperean play (or any of the other British-made films like Snatch or Trainspotting, it takes a while to fall in with the rhythm of the language. Your brain eventually trains itself to accept some of the archaic English as not being gobblelygook, and you find yourself falling into the plot and caring and even admiring the beautiful if somewhat stilted, language.Now I have to admit that I have come into my admiration for Jane Austen late in life (about two weeks ago and I'm 41), and not for not having had exposure to her, either. I do have a degree in English Literature, and Jane Austen is pretty much part of the standard reading requirement for any college or university. I also seem to own all of the books, and I seem to recall doing a paper on Northanger Abbey, even though I couldn't tell you right now what that was all about. This is, however, my first time reading Persuasion, if you don't count the time I tried to pick it up in Jamaica two weeks ago.As an English major, I know that I was supose to revere Jane Austen, but I never understood why. Earlier readings had left no indelible mark on my soul, but for some reason, this time around, I truly was enchanted. With Persuasion, I believe a lot of it had to do with how Austen carefully shapes her characters. These are true people to me, I fancy myself to be Ann, and her two sisters seem to me be just like my two sisters, without the power of the baronet and servants and estates and all that other good stuff that can only come with being a part of that genteel class. Austen lets me live in a world so different from my own, so fascinating in its examination and yet filled with so much of the problems and realities that we would encounter in our everyday lives.Persuasion is a study in human nature. Some might argue that the characters lack depth, for they are either kind and good, like Ann, or selfish and shallow, like her sister Elizabeth. I think though, the genius is in the presentation of such flawed characters - Austen is biting and unforgiving in her portrayals. She is best when she is exposing some unjustness of social mores or grossness of character. But to be fair, even the good can make mistakes and be misled, and the good themselves are trying to determine what their proper place is in this unjust world. It is their goodness which earns them their well-deserved happiness while the selfish and shallow (no one seems truly evil in this book), like in any good fairytale, get what they deserve."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my favorite of all of Jane Austen's novels! I loved it from start to finish! Captain Wentworth is her greatest hero; surpassing even Mr. Darcy. It's wonderful, witty and romantic."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Loved it, never read it before and was well worth the read, another classic, no wonder but it can stand the test of time"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This has always been one of my favorite jane austen books. I love anne and captain wentworth. They both remain faithful to the each other for eight years. That's an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Other than to die hard Austen fans, this &#34;other&#34; perfect writing may be somewhat unknown. It should not be. If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There are many reactions that an Austen fan gets when they confess themselves as such. Perhaps a shared fangirl squee. Maybe an \\"of course you are.\\" Plenty of times it's the admission of not getting Austen. Of not enjoying \\"romance novels.\\" Of being confused or bored by her prose.I carefully say that I am a fan, as I haven't yet made my way through all her works. More than anything, I love Pride and Prejudice with a deep, nostalgic, I've-read-it-a-million-times love.A friend of mine recently picked this up for a re-read, and her reading updates inspired me to give Persuasion a try. It took about three or four chapters before I liked Anne Elliot immensely and reading through the rest of the book was surprisingly easy. What Austen writes is more nuanced than just a romance novel. Her books, Persuasion included, are full of humor and smart commentary and little treats throughout the narration.I think it's all the better that my first time reading Persuasion has happened in my mid-twenties. Where while reading Pride and Prejudice I am all giggles and swoons, Persuasion had me relating and nodding sagely. Anne Elliot is the Austen character I've found so far the easiest to relate to. We've all had our opinions persuaded, we've all felt overlooked, we've all questioned the decisions of our family, we've all questioned our own past decisions. There we find Anne as she finds herself once again moving in the same social circle as Captain Wentworth, \\"the one that got away,\\" to put it tritely.Anne is to be appreciated as a more mature Austen character. She has many admirable traits and many quirks that made me like her. I loved that at 27, and sort of lost in the shuffle of her life, losing consequence and being overlooked, her happiest moments are when she feels useful. Yes, girlfriend. I also loved that often times, she had to retreat, and sit in silence and consider her own thoughts.Though I didn't feel the relationship between Wentworth and Anne quite as much as Darcy and Elizabeth, I loved the themes the plot set up let Austen explore. I loved the relationship between Admiral and Mrs. Croft. It is not often that Austen gives us peeks of long lasting, happy marriages, and in the Crofts she comments on what she thought it ought to be. Sharing the reigns while driving sort of thing. A second favorite moment came when Anne was discussing the differences in feeling between women and men. More than agreeing with anything that was said, I loved it in context. And, of course, that conversation led the way for THE romantic moment in the book, Wentworth's letter to Anne.At the end, I can't really compare this to Pride and Prejudice. I loved that one longer and better. That said, I also can't give Persuasion anything less than five stars. For any faults you might find in Austen, she was not a one hit wonder. Here she provides another book to fall in love with, and I have no doubt that I will visit Anne again. And again, and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My favorite Austen book with Pride and Prejudice a very close second. This is a faster read packed with emotional impact and enjoyable characters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Tantor Media ordinarily produces superb quality audio books -- for example, the Pride and Prejudice recording. However, Tantor's choice of recording artist for Persuasion coupled with overly-long chapters, falls way short of the kind of recording that Jane Austen deserves. This review is not about the novel, which I think is lovely, if not superlative, like Pride and Prejudice or Emma. The recording artist speaks Anne Elliott's parts in an almost-whisper with a slow cadence -- almost like a young schoolgirl's voice. This is not only contrary to the character, who is strong and smart, but is really ridiculous! Anne is an adult and should speak in an adult voice. Also, the artist over-enunciates long and complicated words -- as though she is seeing them for the first time. Therefore, the recording as a whole lacks the smoothness and polish that Austen's writing provides. As for the chapters, Tantor cheapens the MP3 recording by having one track per Austen chapter, which means that some of the climactic chapters are well over 30 minutes long. If one wants to back up and listen to a missed line -- say when driving -- one has to listen to the whole of the chapter (at least that is how my car's MP3 player functions). If Tantor wanted to produce a more user-friendly production, the tracking would be every 5-10 minutes at most. So overall, a disappointing production of a lovely novel. Even so, I have listened to this audio books at least three times so far, and probably will again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews. This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated. I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly. The end did feel a little rushed. However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.Specific to Kindle: Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation. While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found myself completely immersed in Jane Austen's Persuasion. It was a book that I could not put down for I did not want to leave the fascinating world that Ms. Austen has created. Anne and Captain Wentworth were lovely characters and I enjoyed following them throughout their journey. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a beautiful romance novel or a great story in general."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What is my favorite Jane Austen book? Not that I don't love them all but that honor would have to go to Persuasion. It's more mature in tone than her other works, featuring an older heroine. Anne Elliot is 27 and has lost her bloom after being persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth 8 years previously. I love Anne Elliot and it's a tough call to choose between her and Elinor Dashwood for a favorite heroine.Unlike some of Austen's other books, my opinion on this one hasn't really changed at all over the years. I've loved it from the first time I read it and my love has only grown with each rereading. I had the impression before reading it that it would be more on the depressing side, like Mansfield Park, but it's really not. It has the usual cast of satirical, amusing side characters, like the vane Sir Walter and snobby Elizabeth, the hypochondriac Mary, etc. I feel like it's the most romantic of Austen's works as well. You can feel the tension of the unspoken feelings between Anne and Wentworth throughout the whole book until it all comes out in Wentworth's beautiful letter. It makes me swoon every time!The only complaint I really have for this book is that it's so short and a bit truncated. I believe Austen's failing health made her rush things a little bit and cut out some originally planned material. IIRC, she had intended to include some more about Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay, but I'm okay with how it ended up."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I purchased this book to read as an assignment for school in my British Literature class and am extremely pleased.

Although it is important to understand why most actions are done in the book.[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.JANA"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Over the years, I have read &quot;Persuasion&quot; by Jane Austen at LEAST 10 times. Simply put, it is my favorite book. While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life. I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment. This is an excellent and timeless novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This review is for the Norton Critical Edition of Persuasion, and has two parts: a review of Persuasion itself, and a review of Norton Content.No educated person disputes Austen's contribution to the literary world. While her particular craft may not be palatable to all types (whose is?), I maintain that of all Austen's works, Persuasion is the one to hold the most appeal to those unfamiliar with her literature. It could be a \`gateway drug', introducing the reader to Austen, or it could be a delightful \`one-book stand'; whichever way works for the reader.Concealed within Regency trappings is a universal story: there is a \`mythic' quality to it in the sense that C.S. Lewis defines myth. The story reaches through space and time to grab the heart and attention of the reader, compelling her both on and deeper. When the novel opens, Anne Elliot faces the prospect of meeting once again a man with whom she was compelled to break off an engagement nearly eight years prior. While relatively little outward action takes place, Austen builds tension through Anne's inner conflict. Peripheral issues, such as the nature of the change in social systems in this turbulent time in Britain and the place of women in society, serve as complementary fare that highlights the mounting dilemma that Anne faces. In Austen style, the resolution and denouement are highly satisfying and truly ingenious, and the reader is left with meaty material to savor for days to come.The Norton contribution to Persuasion is indispensable. Though I was previously familiar with Persuasion, a favorite professor of mine introduced me to the commentary and contributions within this edition. The preface lays out a road map of sorts for the rest of the book. Included immediately after the conclusion of the novel is the original ending-something that even the non-lit majors in my class found interesting. A fabulous selection of backgrounds and contexts follows, with items such as Henry Austen's \\"Biographical Notice of the Author\\", and a selection from Richard Whateley's \\"Review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion\\", entitled \\"A New Style of Novel\\".Additionally, modern critical commentary is included from Austen scholars Marilyn Butler, Ann Astell, Claudia Johnson, and others. Appearing at the end are a helpful chronology and selected bibliography. Patricia Meyer Spacks did a fabulous and much appreciated job in editing and pulling the work together. This edition is highly recommended, both within the classroom, and without.--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma).For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \\"best\\":\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (the popular choice, and my wife's)\\"Emma\\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one)\\"Persuasion\\" (the truly refined choice)Harrold Bloom in \\"The Western Canon\\" calls it perhaps a \\"perfect novel,\\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment.While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \\"Persuasion\\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \\"autumnal\\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work.The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \\"over the hill\\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently.But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her.This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist.I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories.More than any other of her novels, \\"Persuasion\\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all.Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers.Having said that, \\"Persuasion\\" is simply the best of the best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Certainly one of the greatest literary minds of all time is that of Jane Austen, an author who has been much-maligned by her unfair modern association with \\"chick-lit\\" (it's nice that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was based on \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that should not reflect unduly on Austen's work). The trick is that while Austen's novels do tend to center on a romantic plot they are imbued with many other facets that make them so much more than trifling entertainments. Sharp social commentary is particularly prevalent in all of her novels, perhaps none more-so than her final work, \\"Persuasion\\" -- with its deft handling of a woman's place in society and of the difficulties imposed by class barriers. Its focus is on Anne Elliot, middle child of the pretentious Sir Walter, who has no use for her in his life -- choosing to favor his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who, truly, takes after her father in all selfish respects) and to offer regard to his youngest, Mary, at least as a woman who has fulfilled her purpose by marrying satisfactorily. Years earlier Lady Russell, a family friend who became a sort of surrogate parent to Anne after her mother's death, persuaded Anne to break her engagement to her beloved Frederick Wentworth, believing him to be an inferior sort of person who would only make Anne miserable in time. Now, eight years later, Wentworth is a successful captain in the British navy who has proven that he would have been a more than worthy match for Anne in situation as well as affection. But when he comes back into her life, Anne must live with the consequences of her earlier decision as Wentworth appears to have moved on -- actively seeking a wife right under Anne's nose. Anne also finds herself being courted by her cousin William, who would be a perfectly sensible match for her, but since her heart still belongs to Captain Wentworth she cannot bear to consider it. The plot conventions will be familiar to fans of Austen, but that does not detract from the sharpness and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest. The keen observations are on target, and \\"Persuasion\\" has the added benefit of having some of the best characters in the Austen canon this side of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Anne proves to be a heroine worthy of Elizabeth Bennet's approval, and Captain Wentworth an amiable counterpoint to the steelier Mr. Darcy. Mary's histrionics are reminiscent of the wailings of Mrs. Bennet, providing blissful comic relief without becoming too overbearing. Best of all, naturally, is the omnipresent Austen wit -- an incomparable achievement in all of her novels, on fine display here in \\"Persuasion\\". Anyone who has not yet experienced Jane Austen is missing out on some enjoyable and delightfully thought-provoking reading, and should get started as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's PERSUASION is essentially a comedy of manners--a work in which the characters must negotiate a complex code of conduct in order to survive, much less achieve their ends. And in a certain sense the novel is indicative of Austen's great talent, razor sharp, laced with irony and wit, and remarkably phrased. And yet PERSUASION is quite unlike Austen's other novels in the story it tells.Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot fell in love with a man named Wentworth. Her family and friends disdained the match, arguing that the man was below her in station and lacked any fortune with which to maintain Anne in her accustomed mode of life. Persuaded to reject him against her own will, Anne broke off the engagement--and thereafter found herself unable to love another even as she endured the follies of her father and two sisters. But Wentworth has returned, having made his name and fortune with the British navy, and it is now his turn to reject her.Published in 1816, PERSUASION is the last novel Austen completed before her death a year later, and it is remarkable for a very autumnal tone. Unlike such Austen masterpieces as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA, the herione is not a spirited, quickwitted young women on the verge of matrimony; the hero is not a dashing gentlemen of great estate; there is no verbal duel between the sexes. It is instead the story of a commonsense and pleasantly ordinary woman who considers herself past the likelihood of marriage--and who now wishes only to escape the emotional pain and humiliation visited upon her by a suitor from long ago.While PERSUASION does not really stand along Austen's greatest works, it is nonetheless a very fine novel, a delicately wrought tale of opportunity lost and the passage of time, told in the uniquely piercing style so typical of the author--and while, of course, all eventually comes right for the romantically downtrodden Anne, it has a touch of melancholy quite unlike the tone of her other novels. Austen readers will find it a delight.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's words come to life like notes on a page played by a musician. That most capable \\"musician\\" is Juliet Stevenson, well-known movie and stage actress with the acting chops of the Royal Shakespeare Company behind her. Her training and experience on the stage really shows as she creates individual and convincing voices for each of the characters and highlights the biting and keen observations of the narrator. I had read the book before listening to this audiorecording, and I was amazed at how much I missed. She really brings out the nuances of each character, fully exploiting every detail of each character (Anne's father's vanity, Elizabeth's self-absorption, Anne's self-consciousness and tiny glimpses of her emerging hope) and triumphs with the climactic passage toward the end where she brings Captain Wentworth's letter to life. You can hear the passion and fear in her voice as if it were Captain Wentworth himself. Treat yourself to a Jane Austen reading that brings the text to life."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I love this book, but this copy is not even 4 x 6 inches. The print is very small.

If you can only read one, read one of these."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.Comment"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of Austen's best i read this book for my senior english class it is the only book that i have ever taken to. Hard to understand at first but once you get into it you can't put it down."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although Persuasion was an amazing book, it just did not add up to Jane Austen's other works. While not as silly as EMMA, it did not have the character development or interesting story line(s) of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book might have been a small chapter of a tremendous book. Perhaps it was curtailed by intent. A shallow, somewhat childish plot serves as background for significant character development of Anne Elliot, initially portrayed as a shy retiring late 20s wallflower, but every character, including her Wentworth, view Anne as an intelligent obviously gorgeous woman. What we do have in Persuasion is the admirable psychological manipulation by Anne of her own environment, and though we may be less than entranced by a tale of the English idle rich, we do have a woman of strong mind weaving through a soap opera society of parties, walks by the sea and cards. If able to ignore the vacuous background of the novel, we have good, somewhat humorless auto-pilot type writing showing perhaps more potential than actual accomplishment. I read Pride and Prejudice 30 years ago and remember absolutely nothing about it except that I liked the book. Persuasion very likely will leave a similar impression."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen wrote Persuasion as her last novel. She influenced her characters to be moderate people who lived within the same town as she grew up in. This town is to be called Bath.Anne, the main character of the novel, is the sister of Elizabeth and Mary. The family is well respected in town. They live with their father, Sir Walter Elliot, who without great thinking puts the family into dept. They then move to Bath and leave their house to Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister, the man Anne had once fallen so deeply in love with. Anne goes and visits the Musgrove family where again she meets Captain Wentworth after not seeing him for so long. The Musgrove family, have two children and Captain Wentworth focuses his attention on one in particular.They travel to see another family in which Mr. Elliot falls in love with Anne. After only knowing her for a short period of time they later find out that they are cousins. Anne forgets about Captain Wentworth for awhile and focuses her attention on Mr. Elliot. They become engaged and Anne finds out Mr. Elliot's motives. Forgiving Mr. Elliot Anne stays with him. As time goes by she hears that Captain Wentworth proclaims that his love for her has never gone away.Jane Austen portrays the story as a love story but with a little twist and turn to it. Where family members fall in love and sides are taken. Based in the pas it has a present kind of love to it. Love triangles, family ties, and friendships that go on and off.Persuasion needs a lot of attention. You have to focus on the little details and be interested in old literature and the time period in which the book was based and written in. There were certain things that become uncertain and unclear to understand.The way Jane writes isn't really as typical as most books teenage children would read. She sets her stories on other books she has written and being sick while writing this book, it could have been a little better. Not to say it was a horrible book, but you really have to have the time and heart to read it.If you are a serious reader and can really get into a book, this is a good choice. It portrays a love story that could happen in today's society but has other aspects that allows you to know that it was set back in a time period when love wasn't the one thing everyone was looking for and willing to talk about."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together.

And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The experience of reading _Persuasion_ is closer to that of reading _Jane_Eyre_ than it is to reading _Emma_ or _Pride_and_Prejudice_. Anne, our heroine, is a cut above those around her. She suffers through her social life and keeps her observations to herself. As in Austen's other books, there's plenty of wit to enjoy from the outside. But there's also a deep identification with Anne that brings out the poignancy and suspense of the romance until by the last twenty pages I could hardly stand it. And ahhhh, the payoff. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A wonderfully clever novel. This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man, we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling. I need not worry."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you are a Jane Austen fan, as I am, you will surely enjoy Persuasion. The basic premise is about a young woman who was persuaded to let the love of her life get away, but now he has come back and she's wondering if she still has a chance. Books from this era accurately reflect how actions of individuals were always to be moderate and proper. Nowadays there would be no reason for this book because more likely than not the individuals involved would simply confront each other with questions to find out how the other felt. But back then being so forward was unheard of. So what we have here is a book filled with sexual/romantic tensions that makes for a very exciting read. Jane Austen's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is not milking the climax of her stories for all they're worth. When you reach the scenes in her books that everything has been leading up to, they are always brushed over with scant details and little actual dialogue so that you can't really feel what took place. A bonus about the Austen novels is that they are not so long that it is intimidating just to open them. Overall I would rate this as the best Austen book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book that I have read, and I loved it dearly. So much so that I devoured it in two sittings, two days! Seeing the 1995 BBC movie version made me go out and purchase the book. The book and movie are excellent if you are an incurable romantic such as myself. The writing is brilliant, the characters well-crafted. Anne is a heroine of today, thoroughly modern in every way! Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds do a remarkable job in the movie. Please do yourself a favor and read the book though first."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century. Austen was always demure but she had claws and her books are much more about sex than most of her contemporaries' work. (The act itself, of course, is never mentioned).Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance, which burned brightly when the two protagonists were younger, and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but, unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's, these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen, if these people were real, afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice: how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and, in Persuasion: how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own dysfunctional family? No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.)One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique are her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this \\"critique of the family\\" more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines: she is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know, by reading any of Jane Austen's books, of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows:\\"(Anne and Cpt Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\"That might seem sardonic enough, but here's the clincher!\\"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which... taste cannot tolerate - which ridicule will seize.\\"Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be: intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read: it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not always the most popular of Austen novels but definitely reflective of her older amd more mature style. It is interesting as this is the first time that the Napoleonic Wars are actively referred to, and yet the only novel she completed in peace time.Written at the end of the Napoleonic Wars it is about Anne, daughter of a somewhat snobbish small country gentleman whose idea of himself is far exceeded by his actual worth. She has been persuaded to refuse the only offer for her hand in marriage to a low ranked officer. Now years later through a bad coincidence he has returned to the neighbourhood. He has done well in the wars and is now highly ranked and wealthy from his prize money.Anne must contend with her own feelings even as she sees him happy with the daughters of her neighbour - perhaps ready to chose one of them as his wife.This is very much the conflict of class over substance, of appearance over reality and of the ability to trust one's self over the persuasions of others around.Letters play an enormously important part in Austen's novels, and the use of a letter in this book is wildly romantic and almost dangerous in the context of the situation.I love this novel, it involves an older, more mature heroine, and one who really deserves to be loved. It has much gentler sequences in it than say the rambunciousness of Pride and Prejudice.I may be biased about Austen, but I believe they make some of the best reading about - funny, wildly romantic and deeply satisfying to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you're interested in reading some Austen and haven't before, I would recommend you read Persuasion first as it is the quickest read and, in some ways, the most fulfilling (I know that's subjective!). But I found this book SO \\"lovely\\" and much more fast-paced and intriguing than some of Austen's others. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite by far, but this is a great second. The characters are fabulously complex with the frustrating exterior of serenity. Also, if you are interested: there are some great commentaries on women's position in society during the 19th century in Britain which I found so interesting. Specifically a conversation toward the end in the final party!If you love this book, or other Austens, READ READ READ Reading Lolita in Tehran. It's fabulous and makes Austen so much more interesting and intellectual!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There is no doubt how I doat upon Jane Austen's novels. Add &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the list. Her last finished novel, published after Austen's death, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a mature novel in more senses than one. Our heroine, Anne Elliot, is in her late twenties, by far older than say, an Elizabeth Bennet (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) or an Emma Woodhouse (&quot;Emma&quot;). In addition, Anne seems to have more freedom to move socially and personally than most of Austen's earlier heroines. Within the restrictive pecking order that governs Austen's ficitional world, this is saying something, since Anne is often presented as limited by family and 'connexions'. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a subtle work, as Anne's actions generally take place outside of, and even in spite of, the fashionable circles her family frequents. All of this combines to form a novel of understated depth and skill.&quot;Persuasion&quot; begins in 1814 - turmoil unsettles the Elliot family of Kellynch-hall - Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, live beyond their means upholding family and social pride, and are feeling pressure from creditors and friends to reconstitute their lifestyle. Reluctantly renting their estate to an Admiral and Mrs. Croft, Sir Walter and his darling Elizabeth retreat to a smaller situation at the ultra-fashionable resort town of Bath. Sir Walter's middle daughter, Anne, stays behind with an honored family acquaintance, Lady Russell, intending to join the rest of the family shortly.In retirement thus at Uppercross, Anne is shortly confronted by a change of society - including the return of two men of consequence in her past, a cousin and former heir to her father's estate, William Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she broke a long engagement eight years before. Throughout the novel, Anne finds herself forced to negotiate her way through the flippant vanity of her father and sisters, the reserved judiciousness of her adviser Lady Russell, and her unfortunate friend, Mrs. Smith, while contemplating the possibilities of reestablishing her family's estate with Mr. Elliot or rekindling her affections for Captain Wentworth.Having recently read &quot;The Romance of the New World&quot; by Joan Pong Linton, I found myself drawn in &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the overarching theme of middle class industry and social advancement versus the supposed inherent virtues of landed nobility. With the exception of William Elliot, who only anticipates an inheritance, none of the novel's various suitors, Wentworth, Captain Benwick, Charles Hayter, etc., are directly linked to landed money. Especially in the cases of Wentworth and Benwick, service in the Royal Navy is most often and most convincingly presented as an avenue for monetary, and increasingly, social advancement. A brief scene in which the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple notices Captain Wentworth in a crowd is enough to show us the virtues and attractiveness of a self-made man in Austen's largely aristocratic (if minor aristocracy) fictional universe.There is in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; as in most of Austen, a good deal of time afforded to character development, especially in the context of what I like to call background-checks. In &quot;Persuasion&quot; however, moreso than usual, Anne Elliot is largely left to herself to decide how to proceed in her own most sensitive matters. That she operates outside of her family's regard, and that of her own trusted friend Lady Russell, makes her unique, strong, and more assertive and self-sufficient than many Austen heroines. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is an excellent, intimate novel, with many exquisitely crafted moments of pain, pleasure, and humor. It is one I cannot wait to read again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"For those familiar with Austen's work, Persuasion will be both familiar and somewhat different. All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing. In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals. In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance. Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit. However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma. For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end. Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me. The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent. Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive. So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Just what I was looking for!

However, it grows on you. And most true Austen aficionados prefer this to her other, better-known works. Persuasion demands a bit more from the reader. This is not the book to use as an introduction to dearest Jane; for that you must seek out Emma or Northanger Abbey. But do not allow yourself to be misguided by the reviews of people who, by their own admission, are neither experts nor passionate about the works of this brilliant writer, who was, without a doubt, the finest female writer the English language has ever produced."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the slowest I've ever read a good book in my life!

I wish she would complete the entire Austen novel set."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Amanda Root played the heroine, Anne Elliot, in a great film version, and she is the reader of this audiobook. Her diction is very fine, she is a joy to listen to, and the sensitivity and perceptiveness of a Jane Austen heroine comes across in the narration.This version is abridged. About 40% of the words are retained and 60% discarded. The plot comes across intact, but much of what makes the novel great (the asides, reflections, commentary) is discarded. If you don't mind sitting for a 9-hour version instead of this 4-hour version, check out the unabridged \\"Persuasion\\" audiobook read by Juliet Stevenson. Ms. Stevenson comes across as more of a neutral observer, but she changes her voice more for the various characters.That's not to take away from Amanda Root's uniquely fine reading.

That's what I did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's last novel, Persuasion, we meet the Elliot family: Sir Walter and his daughters, Elizabeth, Mary and the youngest daughter Anne. Over 8 years ago Anne became engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no one to recommend him. After much persuasion from a family friend, Lady Russell, Anne breaks off the engagement. When the reader meets Anne it is more than 8 years later and circumstances have brought her and the now Captain Frederick Wentworth back into each other's lives. Will they be able to rekindle their relationship or did Anne's initial refusal ruin all hope for them to be together...?Reading Jane Austen is truly refreshing! The subtleness with which Austen delves into the relationship between Anne and Captain Wentworth among other characters is beautifully done. A great read!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A wonderful book. Probably one of Jane Austen's better novels along with Pride and Prejudice. Very moving and delightful. I would recommend this book to any whose a Jane Austen fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an interrupted love story, not as piquant as Austen's other novels, but stimulating and provocative in more subtle ways. In a way, it is a study of how we are influenced or persuaded to make choices in our lives, both from within and without, and it is also a study of character. Anne is by far the most likable character, and it is her innately good character that is contrasted with all the others, but for me, Anne is far too restrained to be wholly likable. In one scene, Anne translates an Italian libretto, which she does with great skill, but she refuses to go beyond mere translation and discuss the music due to its romantic nature, which would be inappropriate. The overriding concern for all the characters is always to be socially correct. Persuasion lacks any really spritied characters. But then, why should all stories have spirited characters? There's nothing wrong with a story about more ordinary people. And the way Austen has these \\"ordinary\\" people talking, it is pure literary pleasure to read and savor the English language expressed so eloquently."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My sister had been raving about Persuasion, but after reading a few of Austen's books, I was very relunctant to read it. When I had to read something for English class, I chose Persuasion--hoping I wouldn't be bored out of my mind. Shortly, I was drawn into the world of the heroine: Anne Elliot, and could hardly put the book down! Although Persuasion is predictable, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, Persuasion is probably Heyer's most underrated book. Most people read Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibilty and Emma, but Persuasion doesn't get nearly as much attention, which is very sad as I think it's probably Austen's best-written novel. Perhaps people don't read it because it's about an \\"older\\" hero and heroine, and the heroine is not beautiful, nor is she very spunky or spirited. The story also develops in a much more subtle way than some of Austen's others. Whatever the reason for its lack of popularity, however, it definitely deserves a wider following.Not only is it the most romantic of Austen's books(in my opinion), but it also has the greatest characters! They're funny, silly, stupid, and manipulative- and therefore, completely memorable. And the hero and heroine are just the sort one wants to cheer for, and see settled happily. I admit that P&P;, S&S; and Emma are fun reads, and they'll always have a huge following. Persuasion won't ever reach that level of fandom, but it's definitely on my favorites list and deserves a reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen. Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Musgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Musgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Musgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My husband got me the Kindle for Christmas. I'm an avid reader, and my husband and kids get tired of all the books around the house! I've found it enjoyable for reading many things (can't use it for textbooks where I need the pictures), and it is lightweight which I need for my joint problems.Anyway, I have always loved Jane Austen, but this was one book I hadn't read yet. I had read that this was one of her last books, and that some of the tone of her books changed as she got older. Austen died most probably with breast cancer, so she most probably was dealing with some symptoms at this point in her life. I don't know if she was aware of her situation, that she may die soon, but this book has a certain poignancy in it. It doesn't seem as hopeful or as humorous as her other books that look at life for women in the early 1800's.By this time, she knew she would not have an opportunity to marriage. It's sad that women in England back then, especially those of the trade class/genteel middle class, were so dependent upon men choosing who to marry. They couldn't hold jobs, they had no rights as concerns inheritance, everything in their future depended upon their getting married. But during their lifetime they knew nothing different. Austen dealt with all of these problems, and the very real possibility of injury and disease and death curtailing the lives of women in this novel.She also dealt with snobbishness among the upper classes. That part of the book is hilarious as usual. She really knew how to draw these people, and their attitudes.By the time I got halfway through this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I really wish someone would write of our day and age, in this tone and with this ability to draw people. I haven't ever seen a writer to compare with her...I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At 19-years-old, Anne Elliot was a beauty who fell in love with naval officer Captain Wentworth. The two shared a whirlwind romance; but the fact that Captain Wentworth was lacking in the financial department, caused the two to part ways. It wasn't that Anne wanted to say goodbye to Captain Wentworth; she was more bullied into it by Lady Russell, a friend of her deceased mother. Ten years have passed. Anne is now twenty-nine-years-old. Over the years, she has met no other suitor who tickled her fancy in the way that Captain Wentworth was able to. Thus, she has never gotten married. The fact that her father, Sir Walter Elliot is heavy handed when it comes to spending only makes Anne more convinced that she will never have a significant other; after all, she would not have much in terms of money to bring to a relationship. But then Captain Wentworth comes back.While the ten years which have passed have done little to mar Anne Elliot's beauty, they have done much to decrease the amount of money still left within her family. As a baronet, Sir Walter Elliot is obsessed with keeping up with the times, this means draping himself in all sorts of fashionable garb, and displaying his social rank for the world to see. When not glancing at himself in mirrors, Sir Walter Elliot spends his time with the scheming, husband-hungry, Mrs. Clay. Mrs. Clay, who has befriended Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, would do anything to catch herself a husband. Elizabeth is the same way. Unlike Anne, Elizabeth is just as obsessed with social status as her father; and both Elizabeth and Sir Walter Elliot look down upon Anne. Anne's other sister, Mary, who is married and has children, looks down upon Anne just as her sister and father. Mary expects Anne to wait on her hand and foot at all times - even when she is a guest in her own home. Anne is usually happy to oblige; but when she finds that her home, Kellynch Hall, will be rented out, and that she and her family must take up residence in Bath, she is quite disappointed. That is, until she runs into Captain Wentworth. Captain Wentworth is more dashing than ever before, and Anne can't help but feel the same attraction to him that overwhelmed her ten years ago. But with so much time gone, Anne can't tell if Captain Wentworth still feels the same way about her; and with other women vying for his attentions, she can't help but wonder if the two of them will ever be together again.I will admit that it took me a few chapters to truly become interested in PERSUASION; but once I was introduced to Anne Elliot, there was absolutely no turning back. From the moment Anne Elliot enters the story, you can't help but fall in love with her. She is demure, kind, intelligent, spirited, and debonair, in her own right. She is so willing to please those surrounding her, that, at times, the reader can't help but wish that she would lash out, and speak up for herself. Yet, perhaps, if she did just that, she wouldn't be as much of an appealing, lovable character. Captain Wentworth's quiet, shy, timid persona can be infuriating at times, but he is still a dashing, handsome male lead that you can't help but swoon over. The confusion between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, regarding their relationship, can, at times be trying, as the reader wants to see the two of them together; but the mishaps produce a piece of dry humor that is entertaining and adds to the storyline. PERSUASION presents a whirlwind romance that you can't help but get swept up into!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When Jane Austen finished \\"Persuasion\\" in 1816, she was already suffering from the effects of the disease that would kill her the following year. \\"Persuasion\\" is rather shorter than its precessors such as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It is however the polished work of a mature author, and easily holds its own with her other finished novels.As the story opens, Sir Walter Elliot, a vain and foppish baronet facing bankruptcy, is persuaded to rent his home and move his family to Bath in order to economize on expenses. The middle daughter, Anne, unmarried and ignored by her family, is shocked to learn that the prospective renters are an Admiral Croft and his wife, whose brother is one Frederick Wentworth. Eight years earlier, Wentworth, then a young naval officer lacking wealth and status, had wooed Anne, who was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his suit on the grounds of his lack of prospects. The kind-hearted but much put-upon Anne is left behind by her family to close up the house and to take care of her hypochondriac married younger sister Mary, who lives nearby.While visiting with Mary and her husband Charles Musgrave, Anne encounters the now Captain Wentworth, wealthy with prize money and looking for a potential wife among Charles' two sisters. Wentworth is distant and correct with Anne. When Wentworth proposes a visit to the seaside village of Lyme Regis, Anne is included in the group. While there, Wentworth appears to settle on Louisa Musgrave, only to have Louisa be seriously injured in an accident. The practical Anne takes charge in the crisis, causing Wentworth to take renewed notice of her.Anne ends up in Bath, where her family pursues a meaningless round of social calls. A handsome and long-missing cousin materializes to reconcile with the Elliots and to pay court to Anne. The long-suffering Anne must balance his suspicious attentions with the unclear intentions of Wentworth, who follows Anne to Bath.Anne still loves Wentworth, but hardly dares to hope that he will pass up younger and more attractive women to renew his relationship with her. The inarticulate Wentworth finally finds his voice in a note to Anne, giving her another chance to make the right choice.In this final novel, Anne wrestles with a dilemma common to Austen heroines, whether to marry for love or money and security. The younger Anne was persuaded not to marry for love because Wentworth lacked the money and prospects to give her the security of her station in life. In revisiting that choice, Anne concludes that the advice was correct under the circumstances but proven wrong by subsequent events. Anne believes in marrying for love; the further implication of her internal argument is that she and Wentworth should have waited for each other while he acquired the financial security necessary for their successful life together.\\"Persuasion\\" is a well-written and moving story, filled with the usual well-developed characters and often biting social commentary of a Jane Austen novel. It is very highly recommended to her fans and to those readers looking for an excellent period romance."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I would recommend reading the book before or after seeing any adaptation of Persuasion. It helps to get to know the main characters a little better. Buying this book is well worth the money, because you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Austen's wit and character analysis is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Austen's final completed novel, is set in 1814, an interlude in the long Napoleonic wars. The men are home from the campaigns, with fortunes made and loves lost. It is a time for healing and renewal, while time allows. Austen herself was in deteriorating health and did not have long to live. For her characters too, there is a sense of time running out.In fact, although it is completed, there are signs that Austen would have reworked or further developed some of it, had she lived. A major character (the one who did the initial persuading) is never fully realized, other characters are similarly neglected toward the end, and the novel is relatively short.Persuasion does not have the depth of characterization of Pride and Prejudice, or quite the passion. It also lacks the cynical edge that is found in much of her work. The prose never reaches the sublime heights that she achieves elsewhere, but it is always very fine nonetheless. This makes for a slighter, more comfortable read, and a promise that, only love faithfully, and autumn must somehow pass into summer.There are references in the novel which will be obscure to most of today's readers (for example, \\"the inimitable Miss Larolles\\") and an edition with notes would be a good idea, if you can find one. The Signet Classic edition has no notes, but has quite a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, although it summarizes the plot, so read it after the novel, not before."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This came in a timely faschion. It was sent for next day though we had a big storm it was not anyones fault! Came quickly and was in excellent condition!!! Would order from here again and again!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last completed novel, which was published posthumously was Persuasion and the story starts with Anne Elliot, an upper-class girl at the age of 19, falling in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth. They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa\`s and Henrietta\`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! They were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\""},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen's book (and Pride and Predjudice). Is so beautiful, and charming, and I love the characters,the way of writing and everything. If someone say to you that its boring, forgive him/her: it's because he/she's not a good reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Don't pay attention to all those stretched-minded who say that it is Chinese torture, or something else, read it. If you're intelligent enough, you will find it very interesting and realistic. However, if you don't like it, remember that Jane Austen only wrote to herself, not to all the little minded who found it boring."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Right before this book was &quot;assigned&quot; to our book club, I had read another &quot;classic&quot; so was a little disappointed because I was hoping to read a more modern book.I was in for a surprise. This book was incredibly modern and Jane Austen tackles so many issues that are present today. It's amazing how the heroine of this novel is disappointed with her friends, relatives and acquaintences for things that were completely acceptable (and normal) when the book was written but wouldn't be so today.Despite its date of publication, this is truly a contemporary novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"While not Jane Austen's most popular novel, this story of longing, regret and love, full with the satire and keen observations of the social graces of the period, is one of my personal favorites. The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions. Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming. And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion. I am great fan of romantic literature, and Jane Austen does not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The same remarks apply that I gave regarding Thos. Hardy.PLEASE USE BLACK PRINT:Light Blue is impossible for me.Thanks again,Phil Green."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen writes of enduring love, of strength of character. These are timeless lessons, lessons worth hearing in our world today - that we should carefully consider the wisdom of those who influence our lives and the power persuasion has on us."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Great character development in a work with some light-hearted or humorous scenes, but in general more serious than Emma, Pride and Prejudice... Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan.

Anne is a less indulged Lizzie. Having never been her father's favorite she has learned a subtler, more patient way of living.

It doesn't get dry like Pride and Prejudice.This novel contains irony, dramatic irony, and comic relief with the funny things that the chacters' say or think.I don't want to summerize the book, because I believe that everyone should discover the magic of this novel for themselves.I will say this: I thought the ending was needing something more desired and solid.

Love lost and regained. This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family. Mrs. Smith who is Miss anne Eliot's close friend and the description of her character in the book is much more enjoyable than any of the movie versions can portray."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth once meant a great deal to each other. But that was years ago before Anne's well-meaning friend and her less-than-good-intentioned family discouraged the acquaintance and Anne was convinced to give Frederick up.With years to think of her decision and years to consider all that Wentworth has accomplished without her, Anne has little hope of seeing him again or changing things between them.That is until a change in her father's circumstance forces the family to rent their estate. Given the identity of the new tenants, it seems inevitable that Anne and Captain Wentworth will see each other. It even seems inevitable that Wentworth will be angry and Anne hurt. Only time will tell if they can once again be something more to each other in Persuasion (1818) by Jane Austen.Persuasion is Austen's last novel. It is also a favorite among several of my friends.*With a book that is already such a large part of the public consciousness and the literary canon, there isn't a lot to say in a review that hasn't been said before.Jane Austen is one of my favorite classic authors so it is not, perhaps, especially surprising that I enjoyed Persuasion. In addition to a story that kept me on my toes,** Persuasion features a lot of strong, or at least interesting, characters. Wentworth is appropriately dashing even at his worst. Then we have Anne who is a delightfully forward heroine for a novel from 1818. It was invigorating to watch Anne come into her own as the novel progressed and she developed her own agency and the wherewithal to pursue her own wants and needs.Like many classics Persuasion is a book many people will read on the merits of its reputation (or for school) or it's the kind of book they won't touch. One review might not change whatever opinion you might have but Persuasion is an obvious must read for romantics and anyone who likes their heroines level-headed and ready to stand on their own two feet.*Though one does add the caveat that Pride and Prejudice first has to be taken out of the equation as Pride and Prejudice is arguably everyone's favorite Austen novel.**My only experience with Persuasion before this reading was Diana Peterfreund's post-apocalyptic retelling For Darkness Shows the Stars. I had never even seen a movie version so I really had no idea what to expect from the story. At. All. It made for a pleasant surprise while reading.Possible Pairings: Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, Middlemarch by George Eliot, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banksby E.

And it didn't. I only purchased this book because it was free and because I was OK with Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY, introduced by my sister. I promptly forgot about it. The only reason I ever got around to reading it was because I was bored out of my skull, and looking for something to read. I saw this book, remembered NORTHANGER ABBEY, and decided to read the reviews. It looked decent, so I gave it a try.I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up till 11:00 p.m. reading it! Normally I go to bed at 8:30 to 9:00. And just to give you a better idea of how much I liked it, I read it in two days. This is not a \\"short read.\\"Jane Austen has a skill in making characters come to life. I have been able to connect with each and every one of her heroines, though Elizabeth in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is too contemptous of others. Her books give an idea of the value placed in rank back then. It makes one glad for the semi-equality in the modern world. I loved the dialogues, and Mary, Anne's sister is so ridiculous you want to laugh.Anne falls in love with a poor sailor, Captain Wentworth, but is persuaded that she can make a much better match. She spends the next eight years regretting this decision, and wishing she had followed her better instincts. Captain Wentworth makes his fortune, but his pride is too much damaged to return to Anne. Fate throws them together again in the end as Anne's father rents their house to the Crofts, close relations to Captain Wentworth, and they begin to see each other much more often than they are comfortable with. I will let you discover what happens next, as one review spoiled it all for me.I have now broadened my knowledge of Jane Austen's novels. All of them are very good. My favorite would be PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and my least favorite NORTHANGER ABBEY. I would give all of them five stars, though."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"These Penguin classics are so beautifully designed. They are a pleasure to look at, and a joy to read.

This is quite frankly well written happy tales - much like today's best sellers in pink dust jackets. Persuasion is very similar to Pride and Prejudice - the mood is the same, the excessive one-dimensional characters are the same and the message is quite similar. Still, the strength of the novel, apart from some splendid literary gymnastics, is how it does not take itself very seriously at all. It seems as if Austen simply wanted to write another \\"pretty little piece\\". Call it formulaic, if you like, but Austen knew her strength, as well as her audience.The heroine, Anne, is quite delightful - similar to Elizabeth Bennet in her thoughts and actions. The vain father figure, Sir Walter Eliot, is as comedic as her hypochondriac sister, Mary. The villain, however, is not as good as her other ones - he is bland and dreary, and not all that deliciously bad.My favorite parts of the story are the various observasions of female beauty. Of what does it consist - and how does it change through time? A woman's \\"years of dread\\" are still her thirties - if she is unmarried, that is. The lamentations over hideous crows feet, freckles, faded or coarse skin and the general loss of blom are in many ways just as prevalent in current female literature...Recommended as a sweet little treat - nothing more, but nothing less."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I can't stop reading this book andthe fact that it has kind of an old english doesn't seem to bother me at all."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

Persuasion was the only work of Jane Austen's that I had not read in high school. I don't know why it took me until 32 years of age to decide to read it, but I finally did, and loved it so much! It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth. I can now say that this is my favorite. I was instantly moved to tears at the crucial point of the story I was so touched and affected by Anne's journey of persuasion....I hope you are too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I had been very Curiousabout is book after seeing it in the Movie \\"The Lake House\\".

I have read most of Jane Austen's book and this one certainly did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It feels a bit silly to write a review of one of Jane Austen's last published and perhaps lesser known novels. Anyone looking at Persuasion has certainly read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, and has a good idea what to expect. But I'd like to get a few impressions down.Persuasion focuses on Anne Elliot, middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and the only person in her family who isn't completely proud and self absorbed. In her youth, Anne was persuaded to break off a relationship with a naval officer that her family felt was beneath her station. Eight years later her former beau, Captain Wentworth, is thrown back into her life, much to her discomfort. She is forced to navigate a passel of family issues and potential suitors in order to find a happy match.There are all the usual elements you can expect in an Austen novel. It is a wry, incisive look at the foibles of human nature; in this case, a contrast between those who value a person purely on their birth or station, versus those who look to personality and character. It has various changes of scenery, from the Elliots' traditional home of Kellynch, to the seaside town of Lyme, to Bath, and draws in a host of well drawn characters. The plot is relationship centered, with one good crisis to drive things forward, and, as I've come to expect, much of it hinges on misunderstanding or deception by characters that aren't all they appear to be on the surface.I liked the book, but I can't say I liked it as much as Austen's more popular novels. Elsewhere she seems to have written even her foolish characters with a sympathetic hand; we laugh at them, perhaps we pity them, but nowhere else to they come off as so one-sidedly unpleasant as in Anne's father and sisters. And, by contrast, Anne is almost the perfect heroine from the start, with little room to grow and few mistakes to learn from. I'm happy I finally read Persuasion--it was the one Austen novel I hadn't read--but it's not the first one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is about second chances.

And she gets a second chance with the man of her dreams..."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book truly is amazing. I really enjoyed reading it. I had to do it for a class, but there came a point when I couldn't put it down.

These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Great casting throughout."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion , . . . . Jane AustenA number of reviewers complained of serious issues with the printing of this book. Fortunately for me, I experienced no such problems.Jane Austen was an excellent author and Persuasion is a superb example of her work. It is a classic novel of England at that time period (1818). It is a complicated story of romance greatly affected by the class system. There is a bit of good ol' dry English humor as a member of the upper class is forced to take a step down and still manages to keep his nose in the air. Then there's a love tale of the past that just might flame up again. Of course there has to be a villain in such novels and the one here does a fairly good job of being secretly nasty."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels.

I also adore Anne. All the better that I can now picture Rupert as Captain Wentworth whilst I read (I picture my own Anne, however). Oh, when she first sees him look at her like he used to! And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot)."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The plot was a bit frustrating due to misunderstandings and lack of communication by the main characters. Austen does meander through relationships well in order to sustain the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I confess: I was expecting a lot more from Persuasion. The premise of the book is interesting: it is the story of twenty-seven year old Anne Elliot. Eight years earlier, she rejected Frederick Wentworth, choosing her duty to her family over her love for him. Now, he's back again as a successful navy officer, and Anne thinks this might be their second chance. But he's courting the Musgrove sisters, and seems determined to ignore her.It all sounds very interesting, and Persuasion is definitely one of Jane Austen's more serious works, but the writing lacked something. It wasn't that witty or that interesting in the end. Maybe if I reread it a little later, I'll like it better, but it just didn't draw me in like Pride and Prejudice, and eventually, Emma. I couldn't really relate to Anne like I did to Elizabeth Bennet or Catherine Morland from Northanger Abbey. There wasn't enough of Wentworth. The background history was kind of vague. I'm sorry to be critical of anything of Jane Austen's, but this one just didn't work for me.Becky loved it, so I have to come a to a reluctant conclusion: We really don't have similar opinions on books. Books that I love she doesn't review, books that she loves I don't enjoy as much (generally.) Books that she reviews unfavorably I like. It's kind of sad.Back to Persuasion. As I said, it's a much more serious work; it's not necessarily about young love and flirtation. Anne is still fairly pretty, but she has to face the fact that if she doesn't marry soon, she'll be an old maid. There was a lot less snappy dialogue, and overall, I think it's just an inferior book. I do look forward to reading For Darkness Shows the Stars, a science fiction retelling of it (review coming soon.)All of my reviews can be read at my blog [...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Love the story and the writer. A must read for Austen fans and all lovers of good love stories and classics."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know why this is considered a classic. The language used. Contemporary novels will never be written like this. It is like reading from an artists eyes. The way sentences are written is very different to the way they are written now. A lot of thought went into each [sentence] or rather Jane Austin is so gifted it comes second nature.Now for the book summary and highlights. It was tough to get into. About the sixth chapter is starts getting interesting. Often you put down a book if the first chapter fails to capture the imagination, but with a 'classic' you need a little patience and endurance. It is worth the wait.This review is after reading the classics of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, the Art of War, Moby Dick, Andre Norton's Saragasso Series, Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie, Confucius' Sayings, Common Sense by Thmas Paine, and Treasure Island (to give this context). You see I did not enjoy reading when I was young, but now older and with a 1.25 hour commute on the train (to Brisbane from Gold Coast) and back, I have time !Compared to Charles Dickens, it is an easier read. Charles' book was a tougher read and more complex but it did go into Persuasion but moreso into the realm of manipulation. If you enjopy Persuasion, you should read Dickens' book. Mind you Dickens' book is an even tougher read - I re-read the first seven chapters 3 times ! but it is definitely worth it. Like digging for gold - you struggle a lot, but when you find the gold it is like WOW !Anne Elliott is somewhat ignored by her family (Father Sir Walter and Sister Elizabeth). Her mother passes and their finances are in disarray. Miss Russell a confidant of Sir Walter contrives a scheme to boost their cashflow while moving them elsewhere with little impact to their social-life. Anne who is steadfast and reasonable and even tempered throughout the story demonstrates that not everyone can be manipulated and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending. Through acts behind the seen a third party is after Anne's affections and this person works in concert with other key characters until Anne bumps into an old friend Mrs Smith and the whole scheme is turned on its head !In truth, the major drama surrounds louisa who falls while being silly and nearly kills herself, but the way it is written that part seems trivial and it is used to free certain people and allow certain things to swing in motion. If only Mr Elliot was there sooner and saved Louisa.... There's a thought, then this story may have gone a differnet direction. Read this and see if this review makes any sense at all !?!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is the book a lot of people can relate to, including myself. A story of letting \\"The One\\" get away and the miracle of second chances. The title may not have been her choice (brother Henry named the book after her death), but this is all Austen. It shows how both society and greed for money can be very persuasive.The father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a selfish man who falls prey to extravagants. The widow with three daughters becomes indebted. He is influenced to rent out their home and stay at Bath. He is influenced by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay (a greedy widow of slight lower class to the Elliots). Lady Russell is a friend of the Elliots and godmother to Ann. The Lady is the cause to the way Anne Eliot (at age 18) loses her true love, Frederick Wentworth. Lady Russell finds this was erroneous for persuading Anne's decision.At the age of 27, Anne Elliot is classified as spinster. Her two very selfish and arrogant sisters have both been indifferent towards their middle sister Anne. Anne has let everyone control her in every way. In my opinion, I can understand Frederick's hesitation towards rekindling his love to Anne.The novel is a favorite of mine. It is shorter than all of Jane's novels and the storyline more simple, but it's still a great love story. I agree that it is like a Cinderella story. I sincerely recommend this."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"So happy to have this on my Kindle!! Would recommend it to all Jane Austen lovers. All Austen, all the time!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Just what I ordered! Thank you! Great seller!I recommend product to anyone!I love the book! Wonderful read! Just what I wanted!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Despite better judgement, I am a Jane Austen fan. This isn't my favorite work by her but it is an easy read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"HUGE APOLOGIES TO JANE AUSTEN AND THIS WONDERFUL BOOK. I ordered Persuasion as a gift for my mother. What she received instead DID NOT delight her in the least. It was the COVER shown here, but carefully bound to some nutjob religious rant. NOT PERSUASION. NOT AT ALL. OBVIOUS product tampering.So much for trusting in Amazon as a seller. No way to contact them. \\"My job\\" to jump through hoops (WORSE - to ask my MOTHER to jump through hoops) to return this trash and get my money back. Same as outright theft - selling me garbage I didn't order and making it painful to get the mess corrected. All relying on the fact that the cost is under $9, and so not worth the customer's hassle.So it's fraud or theft - and I'M FURIOUS. No way to contact anyone human for any help. Amazon LLC STINKS!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I could not get interested in this book, or past the style of writing. Jane Austen is just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I love both Persuasion & Pride & Prejudice equally. They are my favourites of her work. I will continue to re-read them"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's Jane Austen, that should speak for itself. Brilliant book, although, I wouldn't recommend the kindle edition for a classic. I'd rather read this and turn the pages. I'm a purist that way.
