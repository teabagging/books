Also, since the text covers so many different things it usually only devotes one or two pages for each technique.Overall, it is a good book to introduce you to techniques, but for the most part it does not go into enough detail to reproduce them. If it had photos rather than drawings it would be close to perfect."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"The Good: Complete Metalsmith by Tim McCreight is an excellent basic text for the beginner jewelry maker. Overall it should probably be purchased by every hobbyist with an interest in working with metal in jewelry making.The Bad: Too much subject matter is condensed to a single page or even a single paragraph. Topics such as gold leaf and its application and enameling are much more complex than the single page definitions Mr. McCreight offers his readers.The Ugly: Because metal smithing goes beyond the simple jewelry making techniques and methods described in this book, Mr. McCreight chose a very misleading title for this book. Additionally many of the methods and techniques described fit better in a basement crafter's arsenal than in a professional metal smith's shop."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This is the best introductory metalsmithing reference book that I have come across so far. McCreight uses basic language and simple images to build understanding of everything from tools to wax casting and includes useful element facts from melting point to purity expectation in an accessible way. The Complete Metalsmith works well as in establishing the base steps for projects and is a essential tool in my little workshop."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"There are a lot of great books on the market for metalsmiths and jewelry makers but this is one of the best. If you are going to buy one book, make this the one. Even if you are going to buy a bunch of books, this is the perfect first one.The Complete Metalsmith by Tim McCreight is the bible for metalworking. It is written as a technical reference book covering physical properties of different metals, basic instructions for almost every jewelry making technique imaginable, and even great extras like basic plans for a jeweler's bench that can easily be modified to fit your space and needs. Just about every tool and piece of equipment imaginable is covered with a good description of basic use and an illustrations. Issues of safety are also thoroughly covered.This is not a pretty book full of full color glossy photos. It is not a detailed project book. But it is a great reference book for your bench. If you need simple basic instructions on any technique or tool, it's a great place to look. Tim McCreight is one of the leading authorities on metalsmithing and jewelry making in the country (maybe in the world), so his instructions are accurate and easy to follow.This book is designed to be used at the bench. The hard cover is covered in a very durable canvas-like material. It has a heavy spiral binding enabling it to lay flat on the work bench.This is definitely the best first book for your collection if you are just learning metal working and jewelry making. Even if you have been at it for a while, it is a great book to have in your collection for when you want to expand into a new technique.Definitely a must have!"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This is a very well written, comprehensive but succinct handbook for anyone from those wanting to start silversmithing to the experienced.

Often I am alone and try teaching myself new techniques. This book has helped me through many situations and taught me things that seemed to be brushed over in class. The writing is well organised and easy to read. The author also seems to have a bit of a sense of humour which makes it even more pleasant.

Although I have not lost any weight I have noticed a decrease in my appetite when I do listen to it. Even if I do not end up losing any weight from it, it is a really nice CD to calm the nerves. I really enjoy listening to it and look forward to a time when I can."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"It is beautiful relaxing music and helps me in falling asleep. I cannot tell that it has helped in any other way and definitely not in helping to lose weight. It just seems like one of those relaxing sound CD's to me."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"I ordered this cd as I thought it may prove helpful to me in getting off the diet merry go round, cure my cravings for white carbs and sugar and help me to get an appropriate weight for my age and height. I have no desire to return to my high school weight of 105, that was over 30 years ago, so at nearly 51, I will be content with being 'good enough' rather than text book perfect BMI.The cd arrived 3 days ago, and I immediately transferred it onto my mp4 so I can listen to it in bed in the morning to start the day right and before sleeping so the subliminal messages get to work during my sleep.I have not overeaten at all since it has arrived. I did have some minor sugar cravings last nite, but was able to fight them off and am feeling quite well today. I have pretty good optomism that this cd may be the answers to my 30 year prayer.Added bonus ! It really helps you to sleep better and encourages very vivid dreams. So far so good, was money worth spending. I have ordered 2 other cds by her as well."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This seems to work alright. I've been using for a couple of weeks.

The days after the nights I had listened, I was not nearly as hungry as I normally am and I didn't crave the sweets I normally do. I don't know if I've lost any weight because I want to wait at least 30 days, but I can tell their is a difference in my appetite."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"The first half of this CD is hard to listen to. Although music is a matter of personal taste, I find this music to be extremely irritating and grinding on the ears. It is played in a high scale on piano (electric or synthesized?) and I find myself passing over 1st half of CD missing the subliminal opportunity. Second half is fine. Subsequently, effectiveness can't be fairly assessed."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This audio product is just great.

After the first listen I noticed a HUGE difference right away!(i just played it as background music the first time while reading). After I got through reading I got up to decide what I was going to eat. My mind went through (by habit) all of the different fast food chains around my house. Everytime I would name off a food item to myself (burger, taco's, fries, etc) My mind would just say \\"no, I don't want that\\". I couldn't explain why I didn't want the food but I just didn't want it. Additionally, I realized that I just wasn't hungry at all. I couldn't bring myself to eat at all!!! It was so strange because I had forgotten that I had listened to the cd since it was just background noice, but apparently it seeped into my subconscious.I've been so accustomed to just eating out of habit even if I'm not hungry and I saw my weight creeping up, but by no means would I be considered overweight, I was just not where I wanted to be. I was looking for something that I can use as an aide to help me get off the 10-20 pounds that I wanted to loose. I have listened to the cd everyday (about 4 days) since I got it and I kid you NOT, the changes were IMMEDIATE! I have managed to eat just a few small meals a day and I have to FORCE myself to even eat those. I am just NOT hungry! I know that the cd is responsible because the whole week before I started the cd I was eating food like it was going out of style! :)One thing that I can say that I would change is the ability to be able to hear her say the weight loss phrases. I know that she says them below audio level but I personally prefer guided meditations such as her Universal Mind cd. But if its working with me not being able to hear the words then I guess I have no complaints.The most important thing that I can say is that you have to strongly believe that you have the power to change your life's current path. If you go into this with an open mind and you believe with everything in you that you will see a change then you will. I have done extensive research on how the mind works and how the subconscious works so I am a TRUE believer in the way God designed our brains to operate. I highly recommend this cd to anyone that is open-minded and wants to loose wait!"},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"My girlfriend and I decided to give this a try because we had both hit a plateau and really could not vamp up our exercise anymore than it was at and already have some very clean diets. I listened to the 1st track all day long at work, she has been listening to the second track two times a day through headphones.Both of us commented that we were feeling more focused during the day and confident. I found that I would get up from my desk at work more often than emailing.I don't know if this is a magic potion. It doesn't do you any harm. I budged 1 pound from my plateau, so it's hard to say for sure, but I think it is a nice tool to have for your efforts and your plan.The subliminal messages are printed in the cd, they are things like I am nourished, I am active, I love exercise, I feel light, I love myself and I feel great, I let my slim self emerge and other things like that.The music is like gentle new agey stuff. It's pleasant, I've been playing it all day, I don't really noctice it much. The friend who listens to the headphone portion says she often dozes off listening to it.The next wave I still just listen all day, she does both tracks and has found she goes in her kitchen a lot less. I suppose it may make a difference what you are really using it for, why do you really need this. Check out the brain sync website for all the subliminal messages you recieve.Okay so after three weeks of use, my girlfriend has budged 4 pounds and I dropped two. So, it is possible the cd helped nudge our plateau. I think this is a very good tool."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"I gave three stars because it's somewhat relaxing to fall asleep to, but I have lots of music that's better for that.

The piano was mostly in the high notes which overtook the rest of the music. I couldn't listen to the CD for more than 3 times because the piano was very irritating to my ears. The high pitched piano keys took away from any relaxation."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"I've had the CD for about 2 weeks and am listening to it daily.

Doing this consistently for the last two months has not helped me loose any weight yet, but I'm still hopeful. Unfortunately, I still have cravings for sweets and fatty foods but I have been drinking much more water lately. I guess that is something, right?! I am going to continue to listen simply because I enjoy the relaxing music but I'm also hoping that some of the subliminal messages sink in also."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This is a theta wave CD purportedly to help the listener retrieve inner qualities of the self that supports losing wieght. The subliminal messages can be detected with careful repetitive listening. I would purchase more of Kelly Howell's collection. It is an interesting concept and may very well have efficacy. I am experimenting and truthfully, haven't formed a concrete view yet."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"The tape is certainly relaxing to listen to, but I just couldn't dedicate that much of my time to listening to a CD. It instructs you to sit in a quiet place where you are unlikely to be disturbed, and that's incredibly hard for me to do.

This one didn't inspire me, just because there was no talking on a conscious level. Howell's CD may be good for falling asleep to, but I want to be inspired as I drift off to sleep.

It's just loud chimes. It is not guided meditation or anyone speaking at all. Just annoying chymes. Save your money."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This is not what I expected. I bought a CD of Kelly Howells a few years back thru Avon. She talks in that one - so that is what I expected with this. I only hear music, and some... singing (?? Aahhhh, humming) but no verbal speaking to help lull you into relaxing. I found myself often thinking of other things I needed to do, and then would fall asleep. My interpretation of the instructions was to listen to track 1 while awake, and I just couldn't accomplish that. It did help me fall asleep though, but I haven't seen much change in my eating habits."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"I am not sure if this works?

I have to say I was not convinced this one would help any more than the others I already have, but was willing to give it a try and I am glad I did.The nice thing about this CD you can listen to it at any time, so I am able to pop it into my player at work put on my headphones and enjoy the music. I noticed a difference in my cravings and eating habits within 3 days.

I don't know if it is the CD or the fact that I am just sick of being overweight, but whatever it is, it's WORKING! I've been listening to the tracks for three weeks and I'm down 7.5lbs. I have lost my cravings for sweets and starches, even around the bad times of the month. My recommendation is to give it a try...you'll definitely be no worse off then you were. Besides the music is very soothing."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"Since ordering this tape 3 months ago, my eating habits have transformed. Playing it as background music while preparing meals, and eating, instead of the unneccessary chatter and stress that usuallly goes on at mealtime, I am calmer inside and feel great! The pitch of the music stimulates different parts of your brain. Since the brain is where your body sends the signals, isn't it wise to stimulate it in a way that works with your body? I love the Kelly Howell Subliminal music. It is new age. When needing to lose weight a persons old habits that are not working need to be transformed into something that is working. Like anything else, decide that this is one of the tools that you are going to make work for you and just do it."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"So, I bought this but I was very skeptical. Having lost 20 pounds so far, my skepticism has been pretty well put to bed.I was about 100 pounds overweight when I bought it, and I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. For the first couple of weeks, I just listened in the evenings without making many behavioral changes. Then I suddenly found myself motivated to start going to the gym in the morning. I also joined Sparkpeople.com, and have actually found myself able to follow the plan with a strange level of ease. Obviously, I am doing all of this myself, consciously and of my own free will, but this CD is the only x-factor I can identify that seems to make it so much easier and more enjoyable than ever before to adopt healthy habits.I bought the CD about two months ago, and have been engaging in weight-loss behaviors for about six weeks. I have lost 20 pounds so far, and I'm still going strong. I am enjoying the taste of fresh produce in a way that I never have before, not to mention how great it feels to push my body past its comfort zone, and really feel my muscles engage. I am feeling so proud of what my body can do. I take a day off every week, where I eat whatever I want, but even on these days my behavior has been incredibly sane. I might eat a couple of cookies, but never a whole batch. I might go out for a cheeseburger, but I'll still order it with a salad instead of fries. I can't stand soda anymore. It tastes like liquid candy. I really can't think of anything that I am doing differently this time, as opposed to the zillion other times I have tried to lose weight, except for listening to this CD.I listen to the CD every single day - I head to bed an hour early, and listen to the first track while reading for 30 minutes. Then I put the book down, turn out the lights, and listen to the second track. Sometimes I drift off during the second track, but it doesn't seem to matter. I wake up motiviated every day. I cannot recommend this CD enough. My three pieces of advice are: 1)listen every day. If you can't make time to do this, it may not work for you. 2) Give it a couple of weeks to start working before you assess its effectiveness. The messages it is sending are challenging some very ingrained subconscious ideas, and it takes time to change these. 3)Don't expect the CD to magically make weight fall away. You have to engage in the appropriate behaviors. But it will make it easier and more pleasurable to do so, at least in my experience.Good luck, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This subliminal CD with Kelly Howell concerning weight loss works. I am a 6 ft. Italian woman.....If it does the trick on me, I can't imagine it not working for someone else.....I have been keeping the weight off to. The CD has a lot of affirmations about self-love and body love as well as picking the right foods for yourself (you don't hear these-you hear music). What my husband and I have noticed (he listens too) is that we have been eating just as much, but the type of food and food combinations have changed. Naturally. Without us consciously thinking about it.We listen to this CD every night & we started loosing weight by 30 days. My hubby lost about 15 pounds, I have lost 25 lbs. over a 5 month period naturally- without any conscious effort, kept it off, & still listen to the cd every night- and am pleased."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"This is a subliminal reprogramming theta wave program. You can hear the pulsing sound waves mixed with beautiful soft and calming piano music. It is a vibratory CD, lasting one hour. (Theta is an excellent wave vibration to use for meditation. I personally like theta for certain meditation, especially meditation programs designed to implant knowledge.) The CD is by Kelly Howell and released by Brain Sync Corp. The music is by Robert Schwimmer. The cover claims that Kelly Howell is acclaimed for her pioneering work in healing and mind-expansion.A tri-fold paper is included, which explains that Brain Sync generates whole brain synchronization and that listening with stereo headphones adds the ability to balance both brain hemispheres. Although it says you can listen to either of the 2 tracks anywhere, I do NOT recommend you listen in the car, unless you are a passenger and are using headphones. I find these types of programs are optimal for quiet meditation time or bedtime, and optimal with earphones. Depending on your job, you can play the CD at work (but, again, I do not recommend playing it if you are operating machinery. Sometimes these types of programs can make you sleepy.) I also firmly believe that you can play a subliminal CD at bedtime and fall asleep with it. Your subconscious mind should pick up the reprogramming, whether you are asleep or awake.In this CD, you do not hear the 20 subliminal messages with your conscious mind. They are apparently imbedded in the background and are listed in the trifold. Some examples are: \\"Every cell of my body exudes beauty and health; I relax into my perfect weight; I burn fat; I am active and full of energy.\\" The trifold advertises a couple of other subliminal CDs, if you are interested, including \\"Stop Smoking and \\"Deep Sleep\\". There is even one called \\"Attract Love\\" (ooo la la!) The trifold suggests that you listen to the CD every day for 6 weeks.What do I think? I'm so glad that you asked. I am a firm believer in high-quality subliminal programming CDs. I have had a good deal of success with some of them. BUT, I have found you need to listen to them EVERY day for at least 30 days to effect a behavioral change. That's 30 days in a row, folks, so be ready to do that. Would something less work? Well, there are no finites (all things are possible), but, I think probably not. (The company recommends 6 weeks, so I would suggest you go with their recommendation because it is likely based on their studies with this material. )Is this high-quality? I just started it myself, but I believe so, based on the vibration I feel and my past experience with these types of programs. That's why I am rating it a 5. I will be back with a follow up comment about the end of May 2008 or sooner.By the way, these programs do usually start to work before the 30 day/or 6 week period concludes. You generally notice subtle differences in the way you think/react/behave. That is your indication that the subliminal material is beginning to work on you. But, one more time, in order to set patterns of behavior change in place, you really need to commit to the one hour a day, every day for the full period. If you listen more that that, you will probably achieve results faster.There are no short cuts to losing weight that I am aware of. The \\"lose weight fast\\" pills that I have found, and the special diets, are only good for a few pounds, especially as you gets older and your metabolism is less active. Exercise helps a great deal, as does eating less calories and good foods (veggies/fruits/proteins). A CD like this one can help re-program your belief system to do the right things and keep you motivated in the right direction."},{"Title":"Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal (Brain Sync Subliminal Series)","review":"I started listening to this during my morning commute during the first few weeks. Now I listen to it a couple of times a week. In the last three months, my eating habits have changed and I've cut out alot of sweets and extra calories.

I'm trying to lose some weight, but more importantly, I was trying to find a way to curb my cravings for sweets & chocolate & sugar. I listened to both tracks with headphones while lying in bed. I did not fall asleep to it, but was very relaxed. I didn't actually \\"hear\\" any words or phrases, I just trusted they were there. Towards the end of each track you can kind of hear something, but I couldn't actually make out what was being said. No joke, the next day I had absolutely no desire for chocolate, cookies, or sweets of any kind. I even walked by a plate of cookies and an open box of chocolates at work, and didn't feel the slightest bit tempted!! I listen now to the \\"listen anytime\\" track while folding laundry, cooking, getting ready for work, whenever. The \\"listen with headphones\\" track I listen to while in bed at night just before going to sleep.

Although his music is his foremost contribution to the world, his writings and drawings express his gently humourous and damning views of the world and offer tremendous insight to his musical work. The book includes a list of the directions his wrote in his musical scores, which are marvellously absurdist. The drawings include the many somewhat enigmatic &quot;advertisement&quot; drawings he made in later life as well as Memoirs of an amnesiac and A mammmal's Notebook. There is also a libretto for a ballet which Satie presented to the directors of the Paris Opera (it was refused) as well as a play with incidental music. Satie's work has been very well translated and quite a bit of it is in both translation and the origonal french, which is lovely if you speak french and enables you to realize how good the translation is. Also, there are no annoying, silly views on Satie by stodgy editors and biographers. One can draw one's own conclusions.I cannot imagine a better book on Satie."},{"Title":"A Mammal's Notebook: Collected Writings of Erik Satie (Atlas Arkhive)","review":"I would like to relate to you all the occasion of my first encounter with \\"A Mammal's Notebook\\". I had found a copy in my university's library. On the train-ride home that same day I started to read. I found Satie's words and satirical sense of humour so delightful that it was impossible for me to put the book away when my train ride came to an end, so my 20-minute walk home became a half hour walk-read with occcasional bursts of laughter. (I guess I looked a little strange, but one often feels compelled to do strange things when immersed in the eccentric world of Satie, who was a true maverick.) Since that time, I have spent many an hour enthralled by this book. (Luckily, I have since invested in my own copy)Now, I may be a little obsessive, but I think many others will also enjoy A Mammal's Notebook.About the contents:Satie is an enigmatic character. He very rarely discussed his own composition processes, so if you are looking for that, you will not find it here.What you will find includes:-A mini biography and timeline-Translations of the witty and mysterious texts that accompany many of his pieces.-A list of Satie's eccentric performance markings translated to English (e.g. Almost invisible..., Avoid any sacrilegious excitement... Grandly forgetting the present,... etc)-Articles which he wrote for publication (on various topics: his contemporaries, the art of reading aloud, books, etc.)-Transcriptions of speeches-Other writings and musings which weren't intended for publication-Sketches (of unusual architectural constructions, boats, etc.)The only thing missing here is an analysis of the material included, but that point is forgivable as there analyses out there. (I would encourage other readers not to skip the end notes as these do give context to some of the items included.)A highly recomended collection."},{"Title":"A Mammal's Notebook: Collected Writings of Erik Satie (Atlas Arkhive)","review":"Norman Lebrecht observes that Virgil Thomson considered Satie the most original mind in modern music, and laments that he applied his gifts so inconsistently. This collection may engender the opposite conclusion, that Satie could have been a great humorist, had he not devoted so much time to musical composition. Included here are the instructions to performers that Satie forbade sharing with the audience, although, unfortunately, the individual piece to which each one applies is not specified. Several essays, notably \\"The Musician's Day,\\" straddle the line between satire and surrealism. Overall, the collection adds a dimension to Satie beyond his music. Somewhat disturbing are the samples of \\"advertisements\\" that reveal an obsession with adolescent interests - castles, sorcerers, and aircraft."},{"Title":"A Mammal's Notebook: Collected Writings of Erik Satie (Atlas Arkhive)","review":"The above reviews are comprehensive concerning the contents of this book.I am one more person who wants to share his enthusiasm for Satie."},{"Title":"The Hite Report on Male Sexuality","review":"The data in this book is deeply flawed.

Make up your own mind."},{"Title":"The Hite Report on Male Sexuality","review":"When this book was at first published, it was revolutionary. Following the female version, it showed men's oppinions about sexuality in a way that had never been discussed before. For people living in the nineties, just a small portion of the book remains interesting. Besides its obsolence, The Hite Report on Male Sexuality is statistically inaccurate, for it was proved that the choice of those 7000 men had a flawed criteria. The author based the research upon forms published in magazines she received. The result is that there's an abnormal concentration of men with sexual problems, causing a distortion in the result. Its historical importance, nevertheless, still remains, and that should be one's only reason to buy it."},{"Title":"The Hite Report on Male Sexuality","review":"Whether the study was accurate enough or not, a lot of data in this book is still valuable. A great amount of men spoke out to a woman who knows how to interpret and how to write. Certainly during the time she wrote it, people were more loyal to any kind of study than nowadays, so you can't just say this book is only a nice thing to have on your shelves (referring to the review of the anonymous man from Argentina here below). It is not fair to state things are inaccurate and proven without mentioning the full (traceable) resources. In the book you can also see she has had many interviews with a lot of men. I still think Shere Hite has managed to collect valuable, timeless data."},{"Title":"The Hite Report on Male Sexuality","review":"Sex researcher Shere Hite brings the same style from her earlier look at female sexuality. Again, Hite compiled information from thousands of anonymous questionaires from the late 1970's, publishing the results, comments, views and attitudes of respondents. The result is an interesting and informative look at male sexuality. This study dates from before safe sex and cyber porn, and many criticized Hite's methodology.

On the first page of this two page binder are cut out holes or ports with three holes per line, one line for each of 2000, 2001 and 2002. The three holes per line are for the dollars minted at the three mints--Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The second page also has the same nine holes but without any dates printed, probably because the US Mint may decide not to mint any of these dollars after 2002. Each line of holes on each page has a clear plastic slide piece which is gently pushed (assembly by buyer) over and under each coin line to cover the coins, front and back, and keep out dust, dirt and corrosion, at least to some degree. Having fifteen of these clear plastic slide, coin-covering albums, I would rank this one on a par with the best in workmanship and layout. There is no doubt in my mind that these albums do protect and display collector coins much better than the older folders in which coins are pressed down into coin holes. Whitman has had a strong reputation for several decades in the production of reliable and attractive coin albums. This Sacagawea dollar album is their latest contribution to their extended history of valuable coin collecting materials."},{"Title":"Sacagawea Dollar Album","review":"The binder I received was in great condition and exactly as I expected based on owning other Whitman coin albums.

The visit ended before I could finish the book, and then the relative got rid of the book during a move. Every so often over the years I would search for the book (partially because I wanted to know how it ended, and partially because the memory of reading the book as a child was a particularly poignant one) but to no avail, until I finally found it on Amazon last year. To be honest, the book was not quite as riveting as my imagination had built it up to be over so many years, but it was a solid read, with interesting characters, a strong sense of time and place, and a satisfying ending. It now has a place on my bookshelf, for me -- and for others, to enjoy."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"As you can read here already, the setting is the South in the 1880's. Fancy is an unusual Yerby character in that she's actually interesting and worthwhile. (Yerby usually can't write a decent female protagonist to save his life.) While struggling to make a better life, even if that means bellydancing for backwoods men, Fancy stays true to herself, despite all the talk and rumors from people who don't really know her. She's strong yet tender, resilient and willing to learn from her mistakes. You truly want to root for her, except for one thing. Her inexplicable love and devotion to Court Brantley. Court does NOTHING right. He cheapens her, ridicules her, shames her, doubts her, cheats on her, lies to her, abuses her and abandons her. You just want to reach into the book and shake Fancy while yelling, \\"Cut him loose and let him sink on his own!\\" Alas, like too many women in real life, Fancy just keeps taking him back, hoping that one day he'll change. He won't. They're called 'loser' for a reason, honey."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"This is a great love story. Read it years ago.

It is a good book with some well-written and well-addressed ideas on implementation of science literacy. Some chapters are better than others in addressing the topics raised. An example is the first chapter is about Equity in Science Education. This time the AAAS did include the disabled/deaf in their concern about equity. Yet the chapter concerned itself mostly with women and racial minorities. In fact, if you look at the references in the back of the chapter, you can see that the AAAS didn't know quite what to do or say about disabled students in classrooms, just that someone needed to make science more equitable. There were 40+ references for women, 70+ references concerned with racial minorities, and only 14 references concerning people with disabilities (and most of these were concerned with learning disabilities). This left the chapter lopsided, and certainly did not give any useful information for special or regular educators who are looking for assistance in how to teach science and math to students with disabilities who are in their regular classrooms. With the push for inclusion (a social, not educational movement), the AAAS needs to address equity for these students. They have yet to do so, and still, they have their own resource directory of scientists and engineers with disabilities. The question is why they didn't ask them to become involved in this chapter and others which affect those with disabilities trying to make it in science? This book has its uses, but has many faults and exclusions which need to be addressed again by the AAAS. It is my hope as a Deaf scientist and educator that they will rethink their chapters to give more useable ideas, make it more equitable, and spout less rhetoric in future publications.

In addition, as with any great diarist, the more we read his writings, the more we enjoy the company of the Duc.

Bravo!!!!"},{"Title":"It's One O'Clock and Here Is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography","review":"I couldn't put the book down and took it with me on a flight to Seattle, then finished it on another flight to San Diego. What a ride! Susan Ware, one of the editors of NOTABLE AMERICAN WOMEN, has gone back way in the past for this one. McBride was the premiere radio interviewer in the US in the 1940s and 1950s; as Ware astutely observes, she was yesteryear's equivalent of Oprah Winfrey, but plus . . . Plus what? Through the privileged relation then of radio to home, McBride created an intimacy with her listeners--seventy percent of them women--which even Oprah can't approximate, though she's certainly tops at what she does. Even Oprah's struggles with her weight, which have endeared her to millions of us, had their original rehearsal in McBride's huge girth, and in one famous incident in 1948 she got caught in a zipper and had to delay coming on to her own show--with complete honesty and charm she told the studio audience what had happened, and people loved her even more.She came from a rocky girlhood in Missouri, and Ware is at her best showing us how she survived all kinds of grim childhood tragedies with a poignant determination to escape poverty. She never looked back; well, except to pen a series of best-selling memoirs of her youth a la Maya Angelou; and she brought her family with her, making sure all were well taken care of. Her mother was a frequent guest on her program, and when the mother died all America cried with her.Mary Margaret never accepted advertising from any sponsors whose products she had not personally tried and approved. Every episode of her show had her, interrupting herself constantly, to talk about up to 14 different ad campaigns. She called this \\"doing the products,\\" and she believed in sponsorship religiously.Ware is very good showing how McBride helped to bolster, indeed create, middlebrow culture, but her distinctions are problematic. McBride, like Oprah, specialized in book promotion, and Ware says that she shunned highbrow culture and never had Hemingway, Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, or Eugene O'Neill on the program. And yet as Ware allows, McBride welcomed William Carlos Williams, James Thurber, Tennessee Williams, Zora Neale Hurston, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and Erskine Caldwell. Not to mention the cultural figures like Orson Welles, Martha Graham, etc. Like it or not, these authors are just as much a part of \\"modernist culture\\" as Faulkner and Company. There's a strange diffusion to some of Ware's arguments in this direction; if she wants to argue one thing, she reads Evidence Item X to prove it, but she then turns around and uses the same item to argue something completely different. In this case, it's arguing for McBride's disdain of modernism and yet her sympathy for writers of color; of course the paths intersect more than Ware wants to admit.The same diffusion is present also during her discussion of whether or not Mary Margaret McBride might have been a Lesbian, or were she and Stella Karn (her producer) just \\"girlfriends\\" of a different sort. Ware's conclusions on this topic vary from chapter to chpater.I love her story about Langston Hughes, present during a taping during which McBride was advertising Dromedary Gingerbread Mix, and she urged him to help her out, and he responded with a perfect ad lib poem (that does not appear in his Collected Poems you may be sure):\\"Dromedary, help me carryNews of chocolate cake;Also, news of gingerbreadFor all the folks who bake.\\"Ware's research (she listened to hundreds of hours of the program to transcribe wonderful tidbits like this) is fantastic. It is a book well done and so provcative in today's radio climate."},{"Title":"It's One O'Clock and Here Is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography","review":"If you don't recognize the name of radio personality Mary Marget McBride, don't worry: she was one of the major radio show hosts of the 1940s and 1950s and had her own popular daily one o'clock broadcast where she interested presidents and famous personalities alike. Five decades after their broadcast her shows still hold relevance today: Susan Ware explores how Mary McBride influenced formats many talk shows still use, capturing the world of 1930s to 1950s radio broadcasting in all its social and political importance. It's One O'clock is the first in-depth examination of McBride's popularity and radio show, following both her life and upbringing and her impact on media as a whole. Susan Ware edits the biographical dictionary Notable American Women and is in the perfect position to lend depth and authority to McBride's achievements."},{"Title":"It's One O'Clock and Here Is Mary Margaret McBride: A Radio Biography","review":"I loved this book it tells how things were in the 1920's-1950's for a driven young woman who became the first talk radio personality.

When Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt failed to show, she substituted Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt who happened to be a studio guest that day. Unfortunately,in the book,author Susan Ware states that Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt's name was also Eleanor. It was not. It was Edith.

Havel's essays are published in several other works, but I haven't found the letters to and about him in any other book. This is an interesting book about a dissident who, while once challenging authority, had the courage to assume it and with it all of its moral complexities.I also recommend James Sire's book \\"Vaclav Havel: The International Conscience of International Politics\\" for a concise and readable introduction to the man and his work."},{"Title":"The blind men and the elephant","review":"\\"The study of comparative religions is the best way to become comparatively religious.\\" Ronald KnoxThere is an old Hindu folk tale about blind men and an elephant. Popularized in verse by John Godfrey Saxe (1816-1887), it is a parable about Man's understanding of, and relationship with, the transcendent. Six blind men went to see an elephant. Each touched the elephant in a different place, one the trunk, one his tusks, one his side, one his back, and so on. Since each sensed the elephant in a different way, they argued amongst one another about who described the elephant correctly. Yet, none was right, since none could really see the elephant for what he was. The blind men represent the religions of the world, who constantly fight and argue amongst themselves over who gets God \\"right\\", when none has the whole picture, and all just have little pieces of the big picture.Is this an apt metaphor for religion? Are the different religions simply the variations and manifestations of Man's search for God, the ultimate, and the transcendent; all equally apt, though ultimately inadequate, means of seeking God? The vindicated secularist in us, and the open-minded religious pluralist in us, is ready to say, \\"of course.\\" The orthodox Jew is us, and the traditional Christian in us, is ready to say, \\"those other religions may be \`blind men', but not we. We have the Truth.\\" Yet, there is a profound truth in this elephant tale. Blindness is a metaphor that takes us back to the Christian Scriptures, where Jesus heals the blind man. The authorities are troubled, since Jesus performed his healing, \\"worked,\\" on the Sabbath, the day of rest. Jesus heals one man's physical blindness, but it was never that man who was really blind. He had faith. The men who are blind are the authorities who cannot look past their own preconceptions and expectations of God to recognize that the duty to honor the Sabbath is really about making time for God, and does not preclude helping others. Physical blindness as a metaphor for spiritual blindness has deeply embedded Scriptural roots. Maybe there is something to this Eastern myth.The Elephant Tale is right. We are all, in many ways, spiritually blind, spiritually impoverished. Yet, how did we get this way? Is there a way out of the darkness and into the light? This story of blind men and an elephant is a good start, but needs to be expanded, and further delved into. Maybe what is needed is an extension of John Godfrey Saxe's poem. Let us continue from Saxe's final stanza, with free story rather than verse, as I do not bear the talents of Saxe....The disputants, I ween,Rail on in utter ignoranceOf what each other mean,And prate about an elephantNot one of them has seen!Papa, the men of the world are blind. They no longer can see the elephant. They search for him, but do not find. They feel him, but are constantly at odds. Why is this so? Was this always so?My child, this is a story of long, long ago. Of a time when all men were blind. This is no longer so.Papa, we are blind! I feel the elephant. He is solid ivory. But, Krishna feels the elephant as long and rollicky!Child, we are not yet ready to speak of the cure for our blindness, the light to be lived. It is a light that men of old had originally seen. Men were not always blind. It was not always this way. Men did not always \\"prate about an elephant not one of them has seen!\\"In the beginning, the elephant raised his trunk, stomped his feet, and breathed life into men. Men could see the elephant. Men loved the elephant, the giver of life. Men touched the elephant. All men could see that the elephant is like a wall, and a spear, and a snake, a tree, a fan, and a rope. Man could see the elephant, and man was happy.What happened, Papa!?The elephant had raised his trunk and breathed life into men so that men would be happy seeing and feeling the elephant. One day, on a day like all others, men, who had been satisfied to see and touch the elephant, with no inclination towards disobedience, decided that it was not enough to see and touch the elephant. Men wished to be elephants, themselves. Then they would know what it would be like to have tusks, a trunk, and ivory skin. They would not need the elephant to experience the elephant feel.Papa, did the men become like elephants? Did they become the source of their own ivory feeling?No, my child! Far from it. Not only did men not become elephants, they lost the vision of the elephant. Because man lost his appreciation, reverence, respect, and love of the elephant, he became blind. Men could now no longer see the elephant. This is why men during the following era prated \\"about an elephant not one of them has seen!\\"Why did the elephant not give men back their sight, Papa? Why must the elephant punish the men like this? I thought the elephant loves the men, Papa?He does love the men, my child. He is not punishing men. Men have chosen to bring blindness upon themselves and their descendents by not seeing the elephant as the elephant. If the elephant simply restores their sight, they still will not see, since they have chosen to hide themselves from the true vision of the elephant. Even if they did see, they may choose to disobey again. How many times should the elephant keep restoring sight, my child?You are wise Papa. This saddens me. Are men doomed to blindness, to never seeing the elephant again? There must be more.There is much more, my child. Men were trapped in blindness for ages. The men would come upon the elephant, and each feeling about blindly, argue with each other about the elephant unseen.This happened every day. The men would visit the elephant, sense about, and prattle on needlessly. Then, on a day like all other days, something changed. The elephant raised his trunk, and roared to one of the men. This one man did not have his vision completely restored. He had inherited the vicissitudes of his ancestors. But, he was given a partial vision of the elephant. As the chosen man, he was destined to teach the men of the world about the elephant. He would suffer cruelties and beatings. Men would continue to mock him, and reject his message.Why, oh why, Papa? This pains my heart to hear of his sufferings. Why would men do this to this man of the elephant?Men were blind, my child. They knew not what they were doing. But, fear not. Light would be returned to men. Out of the house of this man of the elephant would be born One who is not blind. This Man, who was with the elephant, who was the elephant, became flesh, became man, so that men could see.As the men of long ago had lost sight, this Man had sight from the beginning. This Man, the Incarnation of the elephant, was sent to reveal, to be the revelation of, the elephant. He walked amongst the blind men arguing about the elephant. He healed their wounds. He consoled their hurts.Men did not embrace this Man. Instead, they took this Man who could see, they accosted Him, and they blinded Him. They took away his sight.Papa, it appears hopeless. All is lost. If even this Man the men would not accept, all hope is lost.Be not afraid! Blindness does not have the final word, my child. Men had brought blindness into the world. By embracing this blindness, by allowing blindness to come to Him in all its might, this Man took away the power of blindness over men.On the third day, this Man, who had been blinded, returned in all His glory, with full vision and sight and of the elephant. Because of this Man, men now have sight regained. No, this sight did not come all at once, and many are still blind. In the end, when all will be all in the elephant, the blind will see."},{"Title":"Principles of Corporate Communication","review":"Short Review: Star rating 4 - A good introduction to corporate communication, which covers the major developments in the field up to 1995 including chapters on corporate identity and corporate image. If this was an up to date version then it would of possibly been awarded more than 4 stars, which is due mainly to its age. An updated version would be very welcome from this author whom is a leading figure in the academic fields this book covers.Full review: This book, first published in Dutch in 1992, aims to integrate the existing knowledge of corporate communication, to define the discipline and sum up what has been said about it (up until 1995). It also presents useful ways of implementing the ideas.What then is corporate communication?The author, a professor in corporate communication at the Business School of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, defines it as the framework in which the various communication specialists in an organisation integrate the organizational message. This integration can help to define the corporate image and improve corporate performance.The book consists of six chapters. The first one is an introduction to the field. It looks at the nature of corporate communication, for example what different types of communication there are and issues surrounding the different types.Chapter two deals with corporate identity. It starts off with a theoretical discussion of the concept, which covers issues such as how a strong corporate identity can be useful and what different types there are. The second half of the chapter covers practical ways of measuring corporate identity.Chapter three is similar in its form to chapter two, but focuses on corporate image instead of identity. After a theoretical start, the chapter looks at measurement methods used in practice.In the fourth chapter several reference models are discussed, as well as practical models. Van Riel also presents his own corporate communication strategy model.Chapter five looks at ways of organising the corporate communication process in order to integrate all the corporate messages that come from different sources.The last chapter looks at case studies from four large international companies, in order to highlight the importance of theory in corporate communication.SummaryThe book has plenty of analytical discussions, models, diagrams and references to academic works but also practical examples and applications, and will appeal to both academics and practitioners, but is really more academic in content. The chapters are concise and not too long, and each one begins with an abstract. The book has a good mix of theoretical discussion, real life examples and ways of practical implementation. This book would suit anyone interested in corporate image, corporate identity and of course, corporate communication, especially those looking for an overview of these fields up until 1995.Reviewed by Dr Jessica Backlund (MA, PhD) and Shaun Powell (Btech, AIMgt, BAHons) from the International Corporate Branding and Identity Center."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the Police Sergeant Examination (Barron's How to Prepare for the Police Sergeant Examination)","review":"This is very geared to the process and structure.

Military power does not translate into economic power or added prosperity.This book is *loaded* with common sense and specific ideas for getting business leadership back into the global stabilization dialog. The author focused on two ideas that I consider to be especially important: the need to reexamine how the taxpayer dollar is being spent on national security, with a view to redirecting funds (I add: from military heavy metal to what Joe Nye calls soft power: diplomacy, assistance, intelligence); and on the urgency of restoring the independence and expanding the mandate of the U.S. Information Agency so as to overcome the acute misperceptions of the US fostered by Saudi-funded schools for youths being taught to hate, and little else.The non-governmental organizations come in for special scrutiny, and the author has many good ideas, not only for promoting better business-NGO partnerships, but for auditing the NGOs and not ceding to them the moral high ground. As he points out, many organizations that oppose globalization or specific business practices do not have any standards or transparency with respect to who funds them, how decisions are made, and so on.Finally, the author concludes with a focus on business education. While citing many improvements made by many schools, he notes that a comprehensive study and reengineering overall has not occurred since the late 1950's and early 1960's, and that the time is long past when graduate business education must be completely revamped. He is exceptionally astute and credible throughout the book as he explores the many things that CEOs need to know but do not receive training on, to include understanding and dealing with government, NGOs, citizen advocates, and the real world. As he notes, Master's in Business Administration tend to train students for the first years in the corporation, not the long-haul. He places some emphasis on the need to consider continuing education as an extension of the original program, and I immediately thought of an MBA as a limited-term license that must be renewed by recurring personal investments in education.As someone whose opening lecture line to citizens and businessmen is \\"if the State fails, you fail,\\" I found this book extraordinarily valuable and urgent. We get the government we deserve. If citizens do not vote, if businessmen do not think of the larger social goods and social contexts within which they operate, then the government will prove incapable and at some point the party will be over.Yale has always had an extra helping of morality and humanity; in this book the dean of the business school ably makes the case that business leadership and engagement in national security and global stabilization is the sine qua non for continued prosperity. He's got my vote--if I were a mature student looking for a place to learn, he's put Yale right at the top of my list."},{"Title":"The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders","review":"Jeffrey E. Garten methodically helps interested business leaders better define their roles and responsibilities when they deal with such issues as national security, corporate integrity, free trade, community involvement, foreign policy and business education in the aftermath of 9/11 and corporate scandals. Garten concisely reflects on past and present partnerships between governments, businesses and other players to provide business leaders with a roadmap in areas where he perceives their lack of involvement. Garten rightly fears that 9/11 and corporate scandals can lead to over-regulation that is detrimental to economic liberalism and its underlying benefits. Some business leaders probably do not have the time and resources to go way beyond their core mission: i.e. focus on the competitiveness and profitability of their companies. Other business leaders can better optimize existing resources at their disposal within or outside their organizations to keep themselves apprised of these macro issues thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda For Business Leaders","review":"National Security and Market Integrity are the two major areas of concern and focus in America today. This is a paradigm shift from the expectations of a post cold war economy, and the issues facing us are more alarming and dreadful. While the terror attacks can be blamed on the enemy operating from foreign lands, the collapse of Enron followed by several prominent bankruptcy filings are the creations of perpetrators from within corporate America. Never before in history have we faced the challenge on these two dimensions simultaneously. Prof Jeffrey Garten had brought out some of the points mentioned here in his earlier book \\" The Mind of the CEO\\". He had particularly warned of the dilution of long term interests of companies when CEOs chase quarterly figures. In this book he takes stock of the role of the CEOs in the present decade, at a time when their public image has taken a severe beating and the element of trust has severely eroded. Corporate America has a major role to play in shaping the destiny of the country and the pendulum of power now seems to be swinging towards regulation, thanks to the gross misuse and betrayal of freedom of free markets in the second half of the last decade. He looks at the situation both from a historical perspective, examining the foundations of the American economy and the current reality and threats faced by the country and its corporations. The dimension of globalization, the role of developed nations in acting as a catalyst of change, development and prosperity in the developing nations is analyzed well. The role of NGOs and the need for some new institutions to guide the policies and channel investments competing against compelling security considerations is another area of discussion. Ultimately one gets a clear \\"to do\\" list, as spelt out in the agenda points in each chapter. This applies to any CEO who cares for the well being of the nation, in addition to bothering about pleasing Wall Street and his wallet.The author also admits that it would be extremely difficult for the already over worked CEO to find time to take up all these extended responsibilities. They may not have the skills either, to understand issues as diverse as foreign policy, security, global trade, economic development and social welfare. The responsibility then shifts to Business Schools and corporate in-house executive programs to expand their curriculum to meet these challenges. The terrain is uncharted and the challenge is unprecedented, warns the author."},{"Title":"The M16/AR15 Rifle, 3rd Ed. (A Shooter's and Collector's Guide)","review":"The writer here, Joe Poyer, has done an excellent job with technical details, cleaning and maintenance, and historical facts. He also is clearly a pro-2nd amendment guy. However, he has been the victim of leftist California editors, who opted to slip in some historical revisionism and apologist opinions into the early pages of the book. If you skip over the civil war description and irrelevant photos and references to the USS Olympia in 1898, captioned as \\"the symbol of America's imperialist ambitions\\", it's a pretty good book.If Poyer had stood up to the extreme left editors, I'd have given this book five stars.

The book covers every thing from a part by part description to complete breakdown. The only hinderance is that it is black and white, but has tons of photos and diagrams to make up for it. Joe Poyer (the author) did a great job of covering history, laws that affect use, different manufacturers, ammo, options, and troubleshooting.

It contains a very good history of the weapon, lists of variations, and details of the working mechanisms. It also shows, in easy to understand pictures and text, how to break down the weapon, dissasemble and clean it. It also shows how more detailed pieces, not normally taken apart for a cleaning, are put together. All-in-all, well worth the money spent.

(A Shooter's and Collector's Guide)","review":"I bought my first AR15 about 6 months ago and bought this book along with it. After reading through the history of the rifle, how it works and how to treat it, I can definitely say this is a must have book for any new or soon to be AR owner.The book is split up in a way that allows easy indexing for those who just want to use it as a reference or want to reference it often as I've done now that I've read it. The history is complete enough and written well enough to hold your attention but doesn't give so many details that it feels like you're back in high school learning dates, figures and names all over again. Don't get me wrong, that stuff is in there also, but the author had a good enough knowledge of the subject he could fill in between the gaps instead of just repeating what everyone else says.The only downside I've found so far with the book is that sometimes a referenced picture isn't on the page it's referenced from. For example the author may be telling you about something that happen in history and have a picture to back up the story but the picture is three pages away. That's not too bad most of the time but I found it distracting in this book for some reason. The problem was actually caused by a good thing which is that the book is filled with pictures. Yes they may be black and white as some have pointed out, but they are still clear enough to see and understand what is being talked about. Everything about the AR15 is broken down, pulled apart and pictured for you to be able to actually see what is going on under the hood.If you can only get one AR15 book then this could be your book."},{"Title":"The M16/AR15 Rifle, 3rd Ed.

We see historical lies about events that are only a few months old. This article, by David Weinstein, discusses arbitrary myths about the Camp David negotiations spewed forth by Robert Malley and Deborah Sontag.We know that at the Camp David talks, the Arab side refused to agree to peace. Now it is easy to see why. Peace would leave Israel on the map. Peace would permit Middle Eastern Jews in Israel to have human rights. And we know that Israel wanted that. We know that for Israel to turn down a deal, that deal would have to very seriously threaten Israel and Jewish rights.Well, what do Malley and Sontag do about such manifest truths? Let's see what Weinstein has to tell us.First, the revisionists say that Israeli concessions were exaggerated and insufficient. In fact, as Weinstein relates, the Arab side refused to make any concessions at all. He quotes the dovish Shlomo Ben-Ami, who complained that there was no Arab counterproposal and that the only choice for Israelis was to walk out or make more unilateral concessions. Eventually, every Israeli negotiator had to give up.Malley pretends that the Arab side did in fact make concessions. Sontag pretends that the absurd \\"Right of Return\\" of Arabs not to a new Arab West Bank state but to Israel would not be a deal-breaker. And they carefully quote only a few lines from a few people who tell the same sorts of lies. The vast amount of genuine material about Camp David is simply omitted from the revisionist accounts.My conclusion after reading this article is that the revisionist accounts about Camp David are not arguments. They are just ink on paper. There is no real content to them. They are not designed to convince anyone, but to take up space and give antizionists the ability to say that some dissenting material exists.I recommend this article."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"Commander Ned Beach started a trend which lasts today in writing the first Submarine book.

I read it in two days and didn't want to put it down. Beach had a great writing style putting the reader right in the action inside and out of the subs attacking convoys and escort ships.We see the problems with faulty torpedoes early in the war and later that being corrected. The subs sank about half of the total Japanese shipping helping to cripple the supplies and materials to Japan's war machine. Also we see two US subs sank two of Japan's gigantic aircraft carriers. Submarines, many destroyers, other escort ships tankers, freighters and more were sunk by various subs.We see the heroism the skippers and crews had being depth charged and at times shot at on the surface. Many received medals of valor. However many subs and crews were lost.A great non stop action book. I can't say anything bad about it. All good. Anyone having served in the Navy ( I served in the Navy at Holy Lock Scotland working on the outsides of nuclear powered US subs) or interested in WW2 diesel \\"boats\\" will love this book. Rated five stars."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"'Submarine' was a great blow by blow description of many of the Pacific submarine operations in WW II, primarily experienced by the author Edward L.

I really enjoyed it because it reminded me of my short submarine experience in the mid to late 1960's.I was stationed 'out of' New London and immediately recognized the submarine on the cover of the book. SSN-571 is the USS Nautilus which was the first nuclear powered submarine comissioned. This struck me as odd because Nautilus was built long after WW II.

I have recently re-read this book after who knows how many years and am blown away by all of the aspects that pulled this thing together! The writing is as knowledgeable as it is visceral, it packs a punch like a torpedo's warhead! It is also personal, technical, emotional and (auto)biograhical as Beach weaves his own story into that of the greater \\"silent service\\" of the World War II years. The book staggers the experiences of Beach's boats against those of notorious skippers like Morton, Dealey, O'Kane and others. There is a small amount of sanitizing of events (guess which!) which is understandable given the original date of publication. You owe it to yourself to re-read this epic! Lucky you if you are a first-time reader, it won't be your last!"},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"\\"Submarine!\\", by Edward L. Beach, tells the story of several submarines of the United States Navy during World War II. The overarching narrative begins in 1942, with narrator Beach \\"fresh out of Submarine School.\\" We watch Beach rise up the ranks as we learn of his fellow submariners and their ships.Beach treats the subs as characters themselves; he notes, \\"All ships have souls, and all sailors know it\\" early in the book. He develops this theme throughout the book. The interwoven stories of the subs are arranged as chapters, each focusing on one or two ships.Beach's prose at its best is exciting and action-packed, at times reminding me of an old-fashioned motion picture adventure serial. Yet at times he also attains an epic gravitas, and ultimately the book is quite moving. The one criticism I will make is that at times the book felt like it could have used a more judicious editorial hand; I believe that the book's 354 pages might have been reshaped into a leaner and more efficient text without sacrificing the essentials of the narrative.I found \\"Submarine!\\" especially fascinating for the wealth of technical and tactical details that are interwoven into the adventure; it's a virtual encyclopedia of submarine information. Among the many topics covered are test diving, the use of a sub to plant a minefield, dealing with defective torpedoes, how two subs can work together to attack a target, the uses of the periscope, \\"silent running,\\" and much more.Within the book are certain chapters that really stand out, and can even stand alone as self-contained mini-epics. Among these is the story of the encounter between the U.S. sub _Archerfish_ and the Japanese supercarrier _Shinano_, a behemoth 50 times as massive as the sub. This section contains some of the book's best writing. \\"Submarine!\\" is an important and entertaining contribution to the canon of American war literature."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"It has been over 30 years since I read this book, yet it is still fresh in my mind. The book is basically the personal war diary of Edward Latimer Beach as he served on various American submarines in the Pacific in World War II. He had the distinction of serving under Dick \\"Killer\\" O'Kane, one of the leading American submarine aces of the war. He was also fortunate to be transferred off the USS Trigger before she was sunk, and ended the war with his own sub (the first member of the 1939 Naval Academy Class to receive a command). The book is extremely well written, which is unusual for an \\"I was there\\" type war history. Highly recommended, and once you start reading it you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"This book alternates chapters between the author's personal experiences, starting as a junior officer on the Trigger, and the classic patrols of &quot;boats&quot; such as Wahoo, Tang, Seawolf, Batfish and a host of others. Riveting reading from someone who knows of what of he speaks!"},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"I regret that I ignored the rich history of the Silent Service for the 4 years I served on a submarine. I was in the \\"nuclear world\\" and didn't care much about the small, \\"inferior\\" subs of WWII. If I had only read this book back then, I would have seen how wrong I was. This book highlights the glory days of the US Submarine. I was amazed at how intense and exciting the world of fleet boats was. CAPT Beach does an excellent job of telling the technical details without sounding like a boring training manual, and telling the exciting tales of sinking ships and withstanding depth charges without sounding like a cheesy Hollywood movie. I like how the chapters jump back and forth: Every other chapter is written in the first person from CAPT Beach's own experiences (mostly on the Trigger), then the in-between chapters are a 3rd person telling of another submarine's story. After having read this, I have a newfound respect for the WWII submariner... a respect that I could have benefitted from 10 years ago.My only gripe about this book is the cover art. It is a complete slap-in-the-face to the very men the book is about. The most glaring thing is the Navy SEAL trident right in the middle. This book is about WWII submarines. The SEALs didn't even exist until much later and have nothing to do with this story. The submariner's insignia known as the \\"dolphins\\" should be there instead. The other mistake is the photo, which is of the USS Nautilus, the Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, which also didn't exist until several years after WWII and was completely different than the submarines discussed in the book. It should be a photo of the USS Trigger, since that's what the majority of the book is about, or one of the other legendary submarines in the book. I still rate the book 5 stars because of the content, but the cover designer should be fired."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"I was first introduced to Ned Beach through his classic, \\"Run Silent, Run Deep.\\" Since that book was a naval masterpiece, I had high hopes for \\"Submarine\\", an earlier book of his. Attempting to read it at first hurt my brain. It's an odd mix of present and future tense with a little past tense thrown in, and it jumps from one sub to the next all over the place. It reads more like a dissertation on submarine fleet deployment, at least at first. Ned picks up his stride about a third of the way into the book, and from that point on it's incredible. If you're going to read it, make sure you can read the first third of the book in peace and quiet without interruption, otherwise you'll be like me and simply set the book down for a month before coming back to it."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"I sent this to my grandson so he would have an idea of what sacrifices were made to keep us free."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"Edward L. Beach is easily one of the top five most fascinating people I've ever had the opportunity to know. A friend of my father's, he would keep me on the edge of my seat during lunches and later, as I got to know him better, at Navy functions I would arrange for him.Even so, I wish I could say he was a man of singular bravery and heroism, but as I've gotten more involved in the submarine community, I've come to realize that he was but one among many of dedicated men who served in the \\"silent service.\\" Sadly, there are many like him who didn't make it through the war, and their bodies were claimed by the great deep, which was their home.This book is a written legacy of times past, of men who lived, fought and died in the depths of the sea. Ned Beach was a man who, though he is gone, left his story for future generations if they will but read. When he served in the Eisenhower Administration, Beach would return home each night and, using a pad of paper and a clipboard, write at least one page. The story he wrote was the best selling RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP. He was criticized by the Navy at the time because they saw it as a self aggrandizing work, something he wrote on the job. They were wrong on both counts. Beach drew on what he knew and had experienced, and his work paved the way for future submarine thrillers, some great and many more not so great.SUBMARINE! is like listening to Captain Beach relating the story of his life aboard subs. From the first time he saw TRIGGER moored at the docks, and he found himself wondering if it might be his coffin, to the time he learned of her loss with all hands on board, the story is one of love, honor and the tragedy of war. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Submarine!","review":"CAPT Beach's first book - excellent first person narrative, keeps your attention, points out the bravery of these Navy personnel under the most trying conditions - less than 1% of the Navy holding the line against the Japanese in WWII.

Everything from the utter boredom of fruitless patrols to the sheer terror of being depth charged by multiple enemy destroyers is here. I particularly like how the book is divided up. Every other chapter talks about a particular ship's triumphs or tragedies, while the chapters in between discuss the USS Trigger, a ship on which Mr. Beach spent a great deal of time.If you like World War 2 history, and you want to learn more about US submarine warfare during that time, this book is for you.

Considered by many to be the epitome of the vast collection of writings that is Vedanta. Its the story of Lord Krishna's holy teachings and advice to a warrior whose heart is in great distress on the eve of battle. And aren't we all warriors on the eve of the battle of daily life? Lord Krishna explains the various ways a person can seek and find and know God. He speaks directly to each one of us from that transcendent Eternal One point of view, \\"when goodness grows weak, when evil increases, i make myself a body. in every age i come back, to deliver the holy, to destroy the sin of the sinner and to establish righteousness\\". and, \\"though a man be soiled with the sins of a lifetime, let him but love me, rightly resolved, in utter devotion: i see no sinner, that man is holy\\". and, \\"give me your whole heart, love and adore me, worship me always, bow to me only, and you shall find me: this is my promise, who love you dearly.\\" I love the book very much indeed and have read it many times over the past few decades. This particular translation is a thing of sheer beauty and power. This is by far my favorite translation of the several i've read.

Its simply sublime."},{"Title":"The song of God: Bhagavad-Gita","review":"Isherwood took his love of the message of the Gita, and the knowledge he gained from his Teacher to bring the wonderful meaning of the Bhagavad Gita into beautiful English.This work of faith and philosophy gains so much from the beautiful use of words!

Scholars will find much to irritate them here as direct translation was not Isherwood's aim, but rather an interpretation of the text in such a way that was best suited to Isherwood's own aim's of self-enlightenment. This volume is easy to read, and many sections have been put into a semi-poetical form to recall the feel of the original (a big plus, as few modern translations have attempted to do the same). Also, quite interesting is the introduction by Aldous Huxley, in which he relates his &quot;Perennial Philosophy&quot; to the Gita and speaks in detail about Hinduism as well as it's relation to other faiths. An appendix on various Hindoo ideas is included that makes some potentially foreign concepts a little bit easier to assimilate. For anyone who loves the Gita as I do, this book is a treasure trove."},{"Title":"The song of God: Bhagavad-Gita","review":"If we lived in a sane society, a dog-eared copy of the Bhagavad Gita would be on every nightstand in every home of the western world.So many publications of the Bhagavad Gita suffer from the same malady as most publications of the Corpus Hermeticum -- the inherent Knowledge, Existence, and Bliss ends up being buried beneath a ton of commentary. This particular collaboration by Prabhavananda and Isherwood wisely avoids commentary except in the Preface, Introduction, and ending Appendices.I grew up in the Baptist church, the first born son of a Southern Baptist preacher. I can honestly say that the Gita has become as cherished to me as the bible. I now understand why so many Hindus express as much love for the Gita as they do the Sermon on the Mount. Once stripped of the layers of corruptions grandfathered in by men ruled by rajas, both holy books contain the wonderful, blissful, effulgent, Original Truth.The beginning of the Gita, just as with the beginning [Old Testament] of the bible, suffers from Ishwara having breathed it thru the corrupting filters of men living in an age when war was considered noble [not that much has changed even in the 21st century]. Too many souls have rejected the Gita because of being repulsed after reading the first two chapters where Lord Krishna --- Brahman incarnated in the form of a man --- implores Arjuna to \\"shake off this cowardice, Arjuna\\", insisting that \\"if you refuse to fight this righteous war, you will be turning aside from your duty. You will be a sinner, and disgraced\\".Similar words can be found in Numbers 31:14-18. And, among Hindus, as among Christians, too many adherents, dominated by rajas, take such words literally. Note that India is one of only eight nations in our world that stockpile nuclear weapons. Wisely, in Appendix II, Prabhavananda and Isherwood include a short treatise entitled \\"The Gita and War\\" in which Ghandi's accurate assessment of the Gita is provided:\\"...he called it an allegory in which the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, man's higher immpulses, struggling against evil.\\"I highly recommend that those reading the Gita for the first time begin with Appendix II, then read Chapters I and II while Appendix II is still fresh in their mind. After Chapter II, everything will begin to fall into place.And, for Heaven's sake, by all means, ignore any Hindu swami, Muslim iman, or Christian preacher who tries to convince you that there is any such thing as a literal religious war of which you have a duty to Brahman/Allah/Jehovah to fight. What is your duty? Lord Arjuna explains it perfectly in the last chapter of the Gita:\\"When he casts from himVanity, violence,Pride, lust, angerAnd all his possessions,Totally freeFrom the sense of egoAnd tranquil of heart:That man is readyFor oneness with Brahman.And he who dwellsUnited with Brahman,Calm in mind,Not grieving, not craving,Regarding all menWith equal acceptance:He loves me most dearly."},{"Title":"The song of God: Bhagavad-Gita","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. If you're at all curious about Hinduism - this book has it all. Now I don't personally believe that a blue-skinned guy named Krishna ever really existed. But I do believe he is an excellent allegory, or character, used to convey the beliefs of Hinduism and the experience (and non-experience) of Brahman(God). My favorite thing about this book is that Krishna is active in everyday life. The story is actually an excerpt from the epic &quot;Mahabarata&quot;. It takes place in the middle of a battlefield. Arjuna, a warrior, does not want to fight because he sees that all the guys on the other side are his relatives - his brothers so to speak. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight and then goes on to explain why it's ok - all the while expounding the ideals and beliefs of the Hindus. What's cool is that even though they express that God is in everyone and everything - it's ok to participate in ordinary life according to your nature. Arjuna has the nature of a warrior so he is supposed to fight when there is a battle.

While this book accurately reflects the military events of the time, what makes it such a memorable read is its depiction of the society and characteristics of the era. This reader hopes that Mallinson takes Matthew Hervey into some of the other events that a cavalryman might experience in the post- Waterloo age Talent like this should not stop with one. If dashing characters, action and romance are your forte, you will not go wrong with this fine, first effort. As for me, I'm looking forward to the next one--an eternal optimist!"},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"This is a well written piece of historical fiction. It focusses on a British dragoon officer in the period between the end of the Penninsula Wars (1814) and the Battle of Waterloo (1815). It is the first of what will apparently become a series of novels. This is not Richard Sharpe on horseback. Mallinson lacks Cornwell's style and narrative power and fails to provide the battle details that bring the Sharpe novels to life. Instead Mallinson focusses more on the social aspects of the times and the world of officers and gentleman. He apparently knows horses very well and this adds to the telling of his story. Lets hope our young hero goes to India after this or someplace else where the battlefield context can be explored to the depth it requires."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Mr. Mallinson dedicates his book, appropriately to the Light Dragoons, formally the 13th/18th and 15th/19th Hussars. These fine old regiments, like so many in the British Army today, are no more, and live on in truncated form. Mallinson pays tribute to them in his book. Cornet Hervey is a different kind of hero. Those use to the head-bashing logic of Sharpe and co. may find this book a bit of a challenge. I must confess I did at first, but what we have here is a different perspective of the time, and perhaps a somewhat more realistic one. Mallinson's character is educated, and accomplishes more with brains than brawn, though he does not lack in his saber skills, and has a rash temper to boot!Still, we are not dealing with another Sharpe here, and Mallinsonattempts to provide a portrait of the time as well. The middle section where the regiment is stationed in Ireland was particularly well done, as it shows how difficult the transition must be for soldiers to become policemen. Also readers can see how difficult the Irish posting was for British soldiers then, as it is now. Hervey is not a rake like Sharpe, and he must agonize before declaring his love for the woman he desires. The depiction of Waterloo was interesting as well, since Mallinson places Hervey on the left flank of the battlefield, the part of the battle often least discussed, because it lacked the glamor of Hugamont and Le Haie Sainte positions. But this flank was extremely important to Wellington, as the arrival of the Prussians were crucial to the success of the battle. Hervery expereinces the trials and tribulations of awaiting the slow moving Prussians, and must attemept to effectively liason with them as they arrive. Perhaps the characters are a little less vibrant, and the writing a bit slow at times, but this series has promise. Hervey will need to explore his career in the 19th Century British Empire, and will therefore provide the reader with an interesting transition from the conventional warfare of the Napoleanic period, to the smaller affais of the Empire. Perhaps we might get the Sikh Wars in a future installment as well!"},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Mr. Mallinson dedicates his book, appropriately to the Light Dragoons, formally the 13th/18th and 15th/19th Hussars.

Maybe I am spoiled by Sharpe and other fiction describing soldiers and their battles but IMO, this was very dry and a hard read. Hear me out. The book follows a young Cornet of the 6th British Light Dragoons and picks up as he is facing a military trial at the end of hostilities in 1814. It then goes back to recall the events that occurred and his subsequent release from charges. This takes all of about 40 pages of the 320 page book. We then follow him to his peacetime posting and his involvement in the Irish countryside. All the while woven in the story line is a series of encounters with ladies, who he just basically talks with until he finally gets told by his sister and sergeant that one likes him. He gets engaged and then Napoleon makes his escape from Elba. This center section of the story took up about 200+ pages and was absolutely boring. I read alot and I like to have a book to read in bed for 30-60 minutes every night. I put this down several times and read some O'Brien and others as this center section was just plain horrible to get through. While there were some interesting scenes in this section they were too few and far between to save this part of the book.Then came our main character getting into it at Waterloo and becoming a hero. Great stuff and well written. I think the author has the ability to write good stuff but just has to figure out what is interesting and exciting. I actually wanted more at this point. So if you dispose of the middle section of the book you have something worth reading.JM2C"},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"If you are looking for a book with a \\"feel\\" for being a member of Wellington's army in Spain and later Belgium for the Battle of Waterloo, this is your book. If you are looking for sabre slashing, pistol shooting action from horseback this is NOT your book. Coronet Matthew Hervey does see immediate action in the book, cutting a battery of French horse artillery to pieces in a dashing attack. Shortly after that Boney capitulates and the 6th Light Dragoons are shipped back to Blighty and then on to Ireland to help serve warrants and evict tenants. Hervey finds his future mate and then the unit is rushed to Belgium. Anchoring Wellington's right flank their job is to stay in place and prevent the French from turning the British right flank. Not a bad book but I like lots of action and this simply does not have it."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Mallinson tries, as he explains, to write an army counterpart to Patrick O'Brian's Aubery-Maturin series, and he very nearly pulls it off with this book. It is mostly a character study of his young Ensign rather than a book about war. Combat is limited to the very beginning and very end of the book, although the life of a cavalry officer is the main focus. Mallinson clearly intends to make a series of this book, but I am afraid he has run out of wars! O'Brian admitted regretting having started his series in 1800, leaving just 15 years for his characters' growth. Mallinson has started with the last battle of the Napoleonic Wars, so I'm not sure where he will go from here.Yet this book does stand alone as a good read. It certainly gives the reader an idea of the scale of the carnage at Waterloo."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Nearly everyone agrees that Mr. Mallinson's extensive research and intimate personal knowledge of the life of a cavalry officer make this an engaging read. However, one aspect of this novel that has not been discussed much is the role of the Christian faith of the main character, Matthew Hervey and several supporting characters (from fellow soldiers to his pastor father and brother). Like many in England in the early 19th century, Hervey is a devout Christian. Hervey is written as one who views the world from a Protestant Christian perspective, and who strives to be faithful on the battlefield, at home, or wherever he may be. He is shown praying on the battlefield, quoting scripture, and meditating on Christian ethics and morality. The portrayal is honest and not in the least polemical. Christianity and Christians are not caricatured, but portrayed faithfully and engagingly. Thank you Mr. Mallinson for this welcome twist."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"I usually prefer historical fiction novels set in more recent times--Civil War stuff like &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, or WWII fiction like &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;--but because O'Brian and Cornwell have written so well about the Napoleonic era they have sparked my interest in the times. Mallinson has picked up where they left off and done himself proud with a great epic novel centered around Wellington's cavalry. If you like the above books you'll love this one, no doubt about it."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"The style of the writing unexpectedly reminded me of Jane Austin (The author even pays homage to Ms. Austin in the story), a fresh look at a simpler time. Like Austin's work it presented an idealized picture of what life's like back in the &quot;good ol' days&quot;. If you are expecting cover to cover military action, then forget it. The only real action (Battle of Waterloo) occurs at the last 80 pages or so. The &quot;Flashman-esque&quot; explanation of historical events are much less satisfying than how Mr. Frazer might have handled it. There are detailed description of operations of a cavalryman, I wish the author would've included a glossary so I can understand some of the more obscure terms."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"A Close Run Thing is really about life in the early 19th century in Europe as experienced by a cavalry officer, and just a little about military combat. Patrick O'Brian's books take a stab at these topics, but inevitably turns to combat to carry the carry the story, and we all know that the hero will win. In contrast, Mallinson creates a hero who succeeds on intellect and compassion rather than unimaginable feats of courage and daring. Hervey is a real man struggling to live in a real world. O'Brian and Alexander Kent created characters who interacted mostly with the elite of the times. Mallinson spends many more pages having Hervey interact with more common people.The first few pages were tough going, but once I got going, I found the book difficult to put down. In addition to being fun, the book caused me to think about what it was like to live in those times."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Despite Patrick O'Brien's endorsement,comparisons to O'Brien's work are a far stretch.The characters are two dimensional and the author constantly strives to achieve a kind of cutesy authenticity by use of an arcane vocabulary much of it incomprehensible to a modern reader.It reads more like a bad romance novel than good historical fiction and in no sense remotely approaches the quality of O'Brien's work."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"i bought this book and another by the same author on the reviews alone. never again. this book is terrible. if you want good british military fiction read all of john wilcox books. mallinson should read them to and get an idea as how to write books the reader can't put down."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"The style refers unapologetically to Patrick O'brien's Aubrey-Maturin series. It is a hard standard to live up to and the author labors a bit in the early to middle passages. The characters are not a vividly and as surely drawn as in O'brien's best work and the dialog often lacks the sparkle. By the end tho' the author finds his stride. The descriptions of Waterloo are vivid and clear and the later interactions work quite well. Jargon is pretty thick throughout--the publisher should have insisted on a glossary. Even standard dictionaries lack some of terms. If you like O'brien and historical novels of the period, this is worth a read."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"I was surprised that Mallinson's novel received such positive praise in some quarters. The author clearly prefers guns and weapons of war to the motivations of his characters. The author instructs the reader to dislike certain characters and like others, but never gives any events or dialogue to help the reader make up his/her mind. Entire events are glossed over, possibly because of Mallinson's inability to show social interaction, and then the reader is asked to care. The reader is also distanced from the story by the stiff, excruciatingly overdone prose. One very quickly gets the message that the author owns a thesaurus, but enough already. On the plus side, Mallinson's examination of the promotion system is interesting, but hardly enough to sustain a novel of this length. After reading this, I am sure most people would want the author to heed the advice of introductory writing classes and show, don't tell. Consider the ribald adventures of Harry Flashman as an alternative."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"I have not read the various Sharpe novels (yet!) and so cannot compare Matthew Hervey to the Sharpe series. Having read both Flashman and Aubrey-Maturin, I can say that this novels reminds me of those in the search for historical accuracy, if with a protagonist not nearly so flawed (at this stage in his career) as presented by Flashy, Jack Aubrey or Steven Maturin. Cornet Hervey is a paragon of rectitude indeed; but for all that he is a \\"boys own\\" hero at this stage, its also clear he is terribly clueless with women other than his sister, or nuns. I don't think its correct to say he has no depth, as some others have, but I will grant that he is perhaps a little too old (at 25 or so here) and experienced (several years, if not more, on the Peninsula campaign) to be such a naif. Its probably fairest to say it's a case of Hornblower on horseback.That's our protagonist through which we view the troubled life and times of end of the Peninsula War in 1814, keeping the peace in Ireland, and then Waterloo in 1815. Like O'Brien, where much of what is told is really about the Royal Navy, here much of what we get is a study of a cavalry regiment of the British Army - the horses, the officers, the troops. I suppose it is to a degree idealised, but its not hard to imagine the horror of battle either, and no holds are barred in the descriptions of the tragedy of Waterloo, even as a battle won.The set piece of the book is the battle of Waterloo, which it seems to tell quite accurately, albeit focusing on the little part of the battle around Hervey. Yes, Hervey plays an important role which stretches credulity at times, but does so in an engaging manner. The book is interesting and informative both, and pretty good for a first novel. I'm certainly minded to read on and see where Hervey goes from here."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"It has been said that this series does for the horse cavalry what Patrick O'Brian did for fighting sail. That much is true. He takes a particular field of endeavor, the British cavalry, and crafts a good story from a hero engaged in that endeavor. Also like O'Brian, he tends to be a bit more cerebral than your average action/adventure writer. He makes allusions to classical literature, throws around phrases from other languages and uses the technical jargon of the cavalry with abandon. He does this all without making the reader work too terribly much.The story is of a young coronet of the light dragoons. He is a capable young man with high ideals and has been fighting with the peninsular army under Wellington. His ideals come at a price, however. They earn him the enmity of an incompetent general much higher up the food chain. By a feat of daring, he manages to overcome an enemy force and save a battle but doing so allows the general's baggage to be pilfered. That does not sit well with the general and our hero is marked for trouble. The general does manage to make a bit of trouble for the young man but his ideals and standards help him get out of it. Having earned the respect of other in high places helps as well.The story begins during the final drive of the Peninsular campaign. When Napoleon abdicates, the hero's regiment is sent to Ireland. To his chagrin, so is the incompetent general. Again, ideals put him in harms way and help him out again, also with the help of those in high places. The peace does not last too long, though. Napoleon escapes and the regiment is back on its way to Flanders where attrition due to casualties makes a hero and a commander out of our hero.The story is somewhat predictable but no less enjoyable for that. It is well done and ends with the promise of more to come."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"If you can't believe that Aubrey and Maturin will never set sail again, Mallinson offers another perspective on the romantic Napoleonic era. Not as literary as O'Brian, and without much of the political intrigue. This hero doesn't have as many endearing character flaws as that seafaring duo, but M. Hervey is a truer than blue paragon of honor and ambition. You'll root for him."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"This is the first book of Allan Mallinson's steadily-growing series of Matthew Hervey novels, and the place to start. Like all really good novels, while well plotted, these splendid books are character-driven, and it is not very long into each book that one begins to be involved with Hervey, the main character, and with the individuals around him.A Close Run Thing is a wonderfully clear, engaging telling of the battle of Waterloo, and events leading up to it, as well as, of course, the main character's life and growth. The battle scenes are as well-written as one will find, and Mallinson makes the action comprehendible - no easy task (he also has fun introducing the Iron Duke as a minor character, and manages to hit the man's character \\"to the life.\\")Where many such novels fail is in the use of language. Mallinson has succeeded admirably in making his people speak the language of their times, as well as reacting in the way such people - officers, men, gentry - would have done.The actions, gear, drill... all are detailed, accurate, and easy to follow.This is a superb start to a series that improves with each volume. In later books, Hervey takes on a reflective wisdom which may reflect Mallinson's own life, and by the end of the series (as it now is - I hope there will be many more), Matthew Hervey is a valued friend.It is a neat \\"coincidence\\" that one of the reviews quoted on the jacket is by Patrick O'Brian. Readers who appreciate the O'Brian books will surely enjoy these, while those who are not interested in naval maters, or simply looking for a rewarding read, will find in all of the Mallinson books writing which engages the mind and keeps the attention.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"It's got battles, romance, intrigue, family values and a main character with real depth. Also, I just about doubled my limited knowledge of horses and cavalry. Don't let the language scare you: it's English, after all!"},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Mallinson's book is a superb study of the life, traditions, perspective and environment of the Napoleonic cavalry officer. It is also thoroughly engrossing in its depiction of the England of that period, in all its complexity of class, religion, and politics. The story is well paced, beginning and ending with taut and realistic depictions of battle from horseback - this is one of the most detailed depictions of the unique and compelling world of the Napoleonic horse soldier in fiction. The reader is given an eye-level view of the critical impacts that horse quality, unit tactics and weapons, and aggressive regimental leadership had on the successes and failures of that military arm. The comparisons to O'Brien (who, by the way, is credited for delivering advice and encouragement to Mallinson during the writing, so HE apparently thoroughly enjoyed the book) are relevant in so far as the historical period goes, but the characters themselves are of a drastically different motivation and environment - form your own opinion on the validity of such comparisons. Aside from Cornwell's excellent &quot;Sharpe&quot; series, (which, with its focus on the up-from-the-ranks world view of its main character is much different than the upper class atmosphere of the cavalry that defines Mallinson's work) there are few good choices when it comes to military Napoleonic fictions. As we know, excellent choices in the naval arena abound - maybe if more writers with Mallinson's expertise and skill give it a try, the ground pounders (foot and horse) will reclaim some ground. If you enjoy accurate historical fiction, are a lover of horses or the cavalry, or simply enjoy a good story, try this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"Good: Fascinating subject. There's not nearly enough written about cavalry. Research that seems impeccable to me, a nonspecialist in the period. Essentially appealing characters and a plot where plenty happens.Bad: Mallison seems to eschew sensory description almost completely. We never learn what most of the characters look like. We never smell the black powder and the horse poop, see the colors of the banners, hear the roar of cannons -- and so on. Also, the pacing of the plot is strange -- several scenes which really should be &quot;shown&quot;, such as Hervey's first reunion with his family after several years, are &quot;told&quot;.Overall, I enjoyed this, and I suspect that the rough spots in Mallinson's writing may improve in later works."},{"Title":"A CLOSE RUN THING","review":"One the whole, the novel was enjoyable: the characters were interesting, the plot moved well, and it wasn't too predictable - other than the outcome of actual events. Being a horse-person myself, I have always wanted to read more about the role of cavalry in Napoleonic-era fiction. (Bernard Cornwell never dwells upon the topic too long.)The elements of a great novel are all present, but somehow the book falls short of its potential. Perhaps, Mallinson tried to put too much into one book. I never felt that the plot was moving too slowly and would have liked to see the time in Ireland described in more detail.Overall, this book was worth reading, but I will examine closely the subsequent books in this series before deciding to purchase them."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"My name is Cali and I read Jackie's Wild Seattle. The main character that is telling this story is Shannon. Shannon is a 14 year old girl who has a brother named Cody. Cody is 7 and is a real adventurer. Shannon and her younger brother Cody spend the summer with their uncle helping at a wildlife rescue center named Jackie's Wild Seattle. Shannon and Cody come across some real adventures.While Cody and Shannon are at Jackie's Wild Seattle, they come across some big secrets about their uncle, a boy named Tyler and the animals. There are many situations that they are trying to be figure out throughout the story. Tyler is a boy that Shannon met who works at the wildlife center. Tyler is about Shannon's age and he works at the center because the juvenile court judge said he needed to complete community service for his jail term. Shannon didn't understand why he was there and why he did what he did. This story's theme is mostly about human and animal interaction. Through out the story the author, Will Hobbs, wants you to learn that if you never give up, anything is possible.I like this book because it is packed with adventure. This book made me want to help other animals in the wild, just like Shannon, Cody and Neal. This is a lot different from other books I've read because it has more than one problem and it always has a new adventure for a person who likes animals and adventure, then this is a great book for you! I enjoyed it and you will too!"},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"Do you like animal stories? well, if you do you'll love Jackie's Wild Seattle. I loved this book. I really enjoyed reading it because of the way the author wrote. I also liked the plot of it.A reason I liked this book was because of the way the author wrote. I really like how he explains what the characters think and how descriptive he is. Such as the time when Jackie said, \\"In between Neal, splitting down to the floor of the van was enough junk to fill a chest of drawers, including a clipboard, scraps of notes and ball-point pens, a cell phone, and a Starbucks cup.\\" When I read that part I could picture what it looked like in his car. Also, when the author wrote what Jackie had found out about her mysterious uncle and he wrote, 1) Neal's apartment was to cramped for him to keep his weights and exercise equipment. Stuff like that.I also loved the the plot of the story. The adventurous story of a girl saving animals because her uncle is hurt and can't do the job. When I read the summary of the book in the back it gave me a good reason to read it. If there were some other plot in the story I really don't think I would have liked it as much as I did. I also always wanted to read to the next chapter to see what would happen. It sucked me in.I thought that this book was awesome. The plot and the way the author wrote were amazing. I really think you should read this book. Trust me, I'm pretty picky when it comes to books and if I loved it you will to."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"This book was alright, but it was a little boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to somebody who doesn't like animals.

Their parents went on a trip for the summer and they have to go to their Uncle Neal's house. Neal has his own business of recessing animals. They have to live with him for the summer. Neal can't work because he gets hurt, so Shannon starts recessing the animals with Cody. Cody was witness Sept. 11, 2001, so now he is all worried because his parents are away.

The characters are engaging and the story's pace was excellent, hooking me to the end. Each main character comes with his or her own issues to solve. The real thrust of the story is the Great Circle of Healing, not only of the rescued animals but of each character. I most enjoyed the values lessons this book provides. I will warn you, however, not every animal makes it to the end of this book, and there is some violence. I think it is entirely age appropriate, but may bother some more sensitive people.Will Hobbs also provides a terrific glimpse of the Seattle area in Summer, which was a delight to this former resident. Overall, this would be a great book to read aloud as a family."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"Shannon and Cody Young from New Jersey have to spend the summer with their uncle Neal in Seattle, Washington. Neal drives an ambulance for an animal rescue center, Jackie's Wild Seattle. They all stay at the center with Jackie. Tyler is a worker at the center, but unlike the rest, he is not a volunteer. He was sentenced to work there by a judge as punishment for abusively killing a dog. The first time Shannon saw Tyler she could tell he was lost and loning for a friend. Shannon and Tyler become friends, and Shonnon finally gets him to open up to her. He has an abusive father anad a mother who is too afraid to leave him. Shannon and her brother, Cody, help their uncle rescue the hurt animals. While trying to free a red tailed hawk from a fishing net, Neal gets his thumb cut off. It just hangs on from the outer layer of skin. He is determined to free the hawk, though. Shannon finishes freeing the hawk. Then they rush over to the hospital. Shannon overhears the doctor talking and the good news is that they can fix his thumb. The bad news is that she finds out Neal has cancer. This was very suprising to Shannon for she knew nothing of it, neigher did her parents. Shannon decides to keep this information to herself. Since Neal can no longer use his right hand, it is very hard to rescue the animals. Shannon now takes over thsi responsibility. She rescues a baby seal that is badly hurt and about to be swept out to sea by the tide. She repels down a rock cliff. Then with the seal in a bag on her back she climbed back up the cliff. They give the seal some antibiotics, but it dies before they can make it back to the center. At the center, there is a bald eagle who has been rescued, but is unable to even stand by itself. Jackie and Shannon notice that Neal was becoming unusually close to this bird, that he named Liberty. They were worrieed becaus it was about to the point where they would have to put the eagle down, but this would devastate Neal. This was his way of trying to beat cancer. He seemed to think if Liberty made it, so would he. Shannon continued to rescue animals with the help of Cody. A bear cub was one of them. This was the second bear cub at the center. Shannon also got a coyote out of a public elevator. This was a huge advent that made the news. Tyler also rescued a baby fawn. A reporter wrote a big article about Tyler cutting the baby fawn out of its dead mother's stomach. Tyler's dad got mad about the article becuase he doesn't like Tyler working at the center. One night when he got drunk, he called the rescue center to come take a box of mice. This was supose to be an insult, but it didnt bother Shannon nor Cody. Tyler asked to go with them back to the center because he was afraid his dad would hurt him. Tyler's dad has beat him before. That night back at the center, Cody wakes Shannon up becuase a red-tailed hawk, which he keeps sort of as a pet, is making a lot of noise. The hawk never talks at night so Cody knows something is wrong. Cody, Shannnon, and Tyler run outside to see what is the matter. \\"FIRE!!!\\" Read the rest of this book to see what happens. It is a good book with lots of adventure."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"Book ReviewThe book Jackie's Wild Seattle is exciting and propelling. All though the story has some parts that get off subject, the characters are very well thought up. Each character faces a disadvantage or problem. Shannon the main character is always worrying about her parents and the danger they're in. Cody, her brother is obsessed with disasters and is afraid he might have caused the twin towers to fall. The plot is very intriguing. The plot is about a girl (Shannon) having to leave her parents for the summer. She flies on a plane to Seattle where she expects her uncle to pick her up and take her to his apartment, but she gets a big surprise when she flies in. her uncle takes her to a Jackie's wild Seattle which is involved in capturing hurt animals and releasing them when they get well. She ends up playing a big role in capturing the hurt animals because her uncle who plays a big role in capturing them hurt his hand, so know she needs to take over his job. This book has given me a range of different feelings. It left me wondering what well happen to the characters, as they grow older. This book also contained some good humor. I would suggest this book for somebody 9-12 years old. I would also suggest this book to an animal lover. It is a great book and a short read so if your tired of reading books that take you months to finish you should read Jackie's Wild Seattle."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"Jackies wild Seattle is a adventure story about two kids that stay with their uncle in the summer in Seattle,Washington.

To me it was phony and read like a cheesy sit-com. In addition, as a parent, I couldn't get past the danger of the situations the children were consistently in. If it were real life, I think someone may called Child Services on Uncle Neal. If he had been a little more reluctant to take these kids on his rescues it would have added some tension between the characters. Instead of Shannon and Cody being sugary-sweet, they could have blackmailed their uncle. (\\"We'll tell our parents your secret unless you let us come with you!\\") Shannon and Tyler could have been \\"troubled youth\\" together. Then the ending with them all falling in blubbery love with each other would have been a little less predictable.

The story had a lot of different emotions. Happy, sad, angry, anxious...what ever the emotion, I was right there reading it and just couldn't put it down! The last reason I liked it was it was by one of my most favorette authors, Will Hobbs.The best part of the book was when they were in Pioneer Square. They went down to \\"old seattle\\" to help catch a raccoon and saw a toilet about 5ft up on a platform. Man when I read that my friend was looking at me like I was crazy(Which I don't think I'm crazy).The story elements that were the most vivid were one character. His name was Tyler. Will Hobbs described him with wild-looking hair and intense dark eyes. Later he described Tyler \\"as though he slept in his clothes or not sleot at all. The second element is the setting. There are many different settings in this book, Park, van, airport, woods and Pioneer Square are just a few. Jackies Wild Seattle(wild life center for animal that are sick) is the setting I'm going to describe. It's in the woods set backm from the road alittle and is a center which volunteers help with the caring of lots of sick or disabled animals. Now if you read the whole book you will probally find out that Will Hobbs got the idea of Jackies Wild Seattle from a \\"real life\\" situation.( But with different people) but it's in the same area(Seattle Washinton)."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"Shannon, the main character of this story, is a fourteen-year-old girl.

Shannon wont stop thinking about her parents who are in Aphganisten.Uncle Neal has to figure out how he can rescue animals with only one arm. I really like that part because it is a mystery that you really want to find out on what they are going to do. My favorite part was when Shannon had to go in the elevator to talk to the scared cougar to make it feel not so scared anymore.I would recommend this book to children about 9-15.

But when Uncle Neal gets injured, Shannon has to take over the job of trying to save animals in need.The author writes this book from the view of Shannon, but you don't even notice; it seems like there is a narrator! The author, Will Hobbs, put a sense of humor in this book. I've never read a book like it. It made me laugh and it almost made me cry. I loved how this book was so adventurous and funny.

All though it seemed to have a lot of action the voice was weak. People who enjoy reading about animals should read this because animals play a large part. Readers who like realistic fiction could also read this book. The story takes a lot of twists and turns and it has a lot of plot points, where the story sort of changes. Overall, Jackie's Wild Seattle was an interesting book, but not 5-star quality."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"I read \\"Jackie's Wild Seattle\\". The Main charactors were Shannon and Neal.They, along with Shannon's little brother Cody, rescue animals around Seattle. They then take them to Jackie's headquarters, and she heals them. Shannon is a 14 year old girl and she is curious, adventurous, and myserious. She is also an exellent climber.Shannon and Cody are ataying with their uncle Neal over the summer, and they help him rescue the animals. The resolution is very good, but I'm not giving away anything. I thought that the author's style was like it was being told by Shannon, the main charactor.The theme of the book was animals and drama.While reading, I felt happy, sad, curioous, and shocked. I felt especially when I found out what Tyler, a kid working with Jackie for his horrible crime had done.I have never read a book like this before. I loved the suspence and drama in it.Anyone who likes animals, suspence, and drama should read this book."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"In the begginning of the book, Shannon, an average teen girl, and Cody, her younger brother who loves major disastors, visit their uncle Neal's house for a couple long weeks because both of their surgeon parents have to go on a buisness trip in Africa. They did not know much about their uncle, so they did not know that he was a voulenteer van driver and animal rescuer for an animal rescue squad called Jackies Wild Seattle. When Neal went to pick up Shannon and Cody, he had just rescued a couple of baby raccoons that Cody took a liking to. Cody also met Neal's partner/dog, Sage, who didn't like kids.Things happened, some good, some bad. like they met Tyler, a kid with an awful truth about animals. They also experienced many other things like animal rescues. This was a really good book, and if you are an animal lover, you would probably love this book. Although, the book seemed to stay only at Jackies Wild Seattle, and a couple of areas where they rescued animals. But, this is just my opinion.This was a pretty good book, and with a scale of 1-10, it is a 7.5. It wasn't the greatest book, but it wasn't bad either. It had some funny parts, sad parts, and gruesome parts, so it was a well-balanced book. Tyler was a good character to put in, and so was Neal. They didn't tell enough about Sages history, even though she so dramatically hates kids. Jackie, the head of Jackies Wild Seattle, wasn't in the book enough to have her name in the title. It was a good thing that they put in a variety of characters, but sometimes you got them mixed up. I never really saw Shannons name in the beginning, and I thought that the book was crazy when they were at the beach in the begginning of the book, and Shannon wanted to try her new two-piece. It may have been confusing, but i enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Jackie's Wild Seattle","review":"I just finished a great book, Jackie's Wild Seattle. It's about a 14 yar old girl with a brother named Cody that is 7 years old. Shannon and Cody went to their Uncle Neal's apartment in Seattle and thought that they would be staying there. Neal's apartment had a balcony over looking the water. Shannon thought that she would get a good use out of her new swimsuit. But were they would stay was the opposite. Neal didn't have enough room in his apartment for the three of them so they stayed at Jackie's house. Jackie lives in the woods. She has an animal shelter for healing animals on her 5 acre piece or property.When Cody was young he witnessed 9/11. He thought the second crash was his fault because he had wished that he had seen the first plane crash into the first tower and he saw in instant replay but this time to the second tower. Ever since 9/11 Cody has kept a book of disasters with him.Tyler is someone that works at the animal shelter. After Shannon gets to know Tyler she finds out that Tyler is doing community service. What did he do to get himself into community service? Why did Tyler do what he did?This book isn't like other books that I have read because it has lots of plots and turns. Jackie's Wild Seattle holds lots of page turners and adventures. I recommend this book to all animal lovers and adventure seekers."},{"Title":"On the Viking Trail: Travels in Scandinavian America","review":"When Don Lago went looking for his Swedish roots, it was originally to capture memories that would be lost as Alzheimer's disease ravaged his father's mind. Lago's search began with a recreation of a trip his father had taken years before to Granna, Sweden, the Lago ancestral hometown. That journey convinced Lago that his Swedish roots should matter to him, although he \\"wasn't sure exactly what they should mean.\\" To find out, he initiated annual trips to Scandinavia and soon extended his study to American Scandinavia: \\"After I had stayed in Lund, Sweden, I was curious to see Lund, Wisconsin.\\" A former political activist, book reviewer, and kayaking instructor, Lago lives in Arizona, but one could assume from this work that he is rarely home. The account of his peregrinations is the beautiful and thoughtful On the Viking Trail. So much more than a personal account or family tribute, Viking Trail tells of the hardships of immigration, the importance of community, and the roots of American attitudes toward the land.In keeping with his Scandinavian sense of modesty, Lago is surpassingly humble about the book he has written here. On a postcard from a Motel 6 somewhere in Iowa, he wrote me that Viking Trail would be of interest only to those of Scandinavian heritage. Once begun, however, there is no turning back from this travel into Scandinavian America via Lago's volume, there's no putting it down, and there's no forgetting the courage and creativity of these immigrant people and their unique contribution to America. In Viking Trail, not only has Lago found the meaning of his-and his father's-Swedish roots, he's led us to discover our own.[...]"},{"Title":"On the Viking Trail: Travels in Scandinavian America","review":"I'm only half way through but I must stop to urge Scandinavian Americans everywhere to read and reread this wise, wonderful and informative exploration of what it means to be a Scandinavian American.

Would it be dry and academic? No. The book is a good read, warm, entertaining, charming and witty.The author's purpose was to retrace his Swedish roots, but beyond that to understand the experience of Scandinavians in America. So, while the book has a strong Swedish motif, he includes Danes, Norwegians and Finns--although he found that the latter consider themselves to be non-Scandinavians.He uses his imagination and humor to develop themes supplying context and meaning to his searches. The humor is often at the author's expense as real life tramples over his literary constructs. Along the way the reader is enchanted by the many stories of people and places that Lago scatters throughout this fine book. In a gentle and always fascinating style he illustrates the many contributions that Scandinavian immigrants have made to American life. He is a good writer and readers will enjoy his clear, supply prose.Something that I really like about the book is that although his travels and tales are lighthearted, the author develops some deep and penetrating insights about what it means to be an American, what America is and what it means to the world. In these meditations, Lago gives us his own thoughts, not citations and footnotes. In Swedish style, this is done modestly and in a quiet voice. It is clear that he would like nothing more than to share a good discussion about his themes and conclusions with his readers, who will feel that they are holding a conversation with Don Lago, hopefully over a steaming cup of Gevalia coffee."},{"Title":"On the Viking Trail: Travels in Scandinavian America","review":"It is now over 45 years since I left Sweden for USA. Although I quite well follow what is happening in the Swedish-American press I was delighted to learn about so many more places with a Swedish background and history.

I just would love to meet Don Lago.Stig Magnus"},{"Title":"On the Viking Trail: Travels in Scandinavian America","review":"My mother would carefully place the tomte on the shelves of our living room book case every December about a week before Christmas, along with miniature goats made of straw, and sheaths of grain that she said were for the birds who were in search of food during the snowy months of winter. The tomte were the little people or elves of my Swedish ancestors' culture, and they brought a sense of humor and delight to the darkening days of winter, as well as a reminder of how we must treat each other and nature with respect. If we didn't care for nature's creatures, the tomte might play nasty tricks on us.From these early childhood memories of my Scandinavian heritage, I developed an interest for learning more about the folklore and mythology of the Nordic people and their relationship to nature. As an environmental educator, I have come to appreciate the values of stories to teach lessons and draw analogies. This form of cultural wisdom, shared through stories, fables, and myths, forms the basis of awareness toward the good as well as the bad or dangerous aspects of nature. Academia refers to our \\"mythopoetic\\" connections to nature; the sources of wisdom that form a sense of moral and ethical relationship to the natural world as well as our relationships to one another. Much of this wisdom is rapidly being lost by the homogenizing process of modern American culture.As a Professor of Environmental Studies at Prescott College, Prescott, Az., I have had the opportunity to live, study, and teach in Norway and Sweden. I have been focusing on a tradition of planting a \\"sacred\\" tree in the courtyard of the farm; a tradition that goes back at least to the Viking Age, and is part of the cultural landscape today.Don Lago's book, \\"On the Viking Trail\\" mirrored and confirmed the significance of researching my own Scandinavian heritage and what it means to be a Scandinavian/American. Don's writing style engaged me both personally and academically. I find it ironic and perhaps serendipitous that both Don and I are residents of Arizona, where the debate over immigration, ethnicity and what it means to be an American are at a boiling point. \\"On the Viking Trail\\" captures the essence of this debate. Don is an amazing story teller who weaves together personal accounts with relevant historical and cultural insight. The book challenges us to better understand ethnic diversity and what it means to the American Culture and our own identity within it."},{"Title":"A Potter's Book.

The book attempts to take a global perspective less successfully, since space constrains the extent to which the contributors can explain policy considerations, community context, and individual and couple behavior within one culture, let alone several. But the overall contribution is both a good overview of domestic violence issues and a comprehensive and directly applicable description of theory that encompasses intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social structural processes.

Doctorow, author of \\"Ragtime.\\" It was helpful to read his description of Theodore Dreiser as a son of German immigrants who eventually finds his way from Indiana to Chicago where he worked in a variety of odd jobs from dishwasher,shipping clerk, truck driver, and bill collector. The inspiration for Sister Carrie came in part from his life experiences and those of his family--his sister ran off to Toronto with a married man. This story is of a young woman from a small midwestern town who comes to Chicago to stay with her married sister and find work. She soon finds it difficult to live in a cloistered environment with her brother-in-law who is overly protective and puritanical, and the sister with a small baby who is always tired and not much company for Carrie. Her first job in a sweatshop punching eyelets in shoes is grueling with long hours and in the company of girls who are silly and uneducated. When she feels like her life is becoming unbearable she encounters a man named Drouet that she met on the train who persuades her to abandon her place and let him help her. Helping her out eventually leads to both of them living together. Drouet also introduces another gentlemen named Hurstwood, who owns a saloon, is married with a grown son and daughter(unbeknownst to Carrie!) and is fairly successful except he has a cold, domineering wife. Now Carrie has two men at her disposal and increasingly spends more time with Hurstwood who seems more caring, understanding of her emotional needs, and much more polished than the travelling salesman, huckster, Drouet. Life for Carrie becomes even more interesting as she is persuaded by Drouet to take a role in a small production which gives her some feelings of confidence and ability. This is where the turning point occurs in this book as Carrie's existence becomes even more complicated as she ends up leaving Chicago in a somewhat coerced manner and eventually ending up in New York and being with Hurstwood who has left Chicago under some suspicious circumstances. Once again there is the challenge of making their ways in New York which leads ultimately to Hurstwood's downfall and Carrie's rise to fame. We are shown the cruel environment of New York's seedy side along with streetcar driver strikes, terrible poverty and the feeling of despair that one must have experiencing those circumstances. For a man like Hurstwood it's especially bad because he was once successful and is having to look for menial work which he feels is not only beneath him but it's work that requires skills that he doesn't have. Carrie's successes become greater but she is still left with very little that is meaningful in her life and she ends up alone once again. Dreiser's writing is very descriptive of the times although the characters' conversations seem very stilted and unnatural. The characters for the most part are very dry and lifeless. The only one that stands out as someone who has a clear perspective of the world and a sense of values is the young man, Ames, who finally takes an interest in Carrie and sees much more than just acting skills--she has an air of sympathy and he can see it in her eyes and mouth. Sadly he doesn't appear until almost at the end of the book!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Great local color regarding Chicago at the turn of the century (1890). Very descriptive. Modern in that the woman doesn't get punished for being superficial and materialistic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This book is classic American literature for the way it portrayed a young woman who climbed via a combination of feminine wiles, theatrical ability, and liaisons with different men - a daring theme for a book published in 1900. The story centers on young Carrie Meeber, who arrives in Chicago to live with her sister and brother-in-law. Carrie is expected by her hosts to work full-time, turn over her pay, and basically sit quietly in her free time. Thankfully, she rebels against such strictures and soon leaves. Carries soon finds herself rising via incredible talent on the theatrical stage and affairs with a couple of men. In time she leaves for New York City with Hurstwood, whom she splits up with (he ends his days in flophouses) when the time is appropriate.I found this book a bit less engaging than most reviewers, yet it is clearly worth reading. Author Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) attacked the way women were made to be dependent on men, and his sympathetic portrayal of Carrie was considered highly controversial in 1900. As such Dreiser found his book banned and then published over a decade later with several sections omitted."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"In my English 3 honors class, we had to pick a novel out of a list, and then do a big project on it.

Overall, I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to any book lover!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is more a book of its times than universal appeal. The descriptions of Chicago and New York in turn of the 19th century are fascinating, and the industrial lens through which we see Chicago and the dazzling glamour through which we see New York mirror well Carrie's journey. From small town girl to brief hard labor to kept woman to playing at housewife to famous stage actress, Carrie is at times the protaganist but most often than not the passive participant that life and those around her act upon.You can almost see Dreiser's fearsome awe of the big city, Chicago, and later especially New York, through Carrie's eyes. And Carrie's evolution from country girl to renowned actress somehow had to start in Chicago and end up in New York. Chicago is depicted as a maturing city where young men and women in search of \\"bigger things\\" are often swallowed up by the industrial complex of the city. But at the same, Chicago is still small and collegial enough that a few bright luminaries can congregate at posh bars and dominate the social scene. In Chicago, Carrie rejects hard, manual labor and essentially allows herself to be bought by Drouet as pampered mistress. For a couple of years, as Carrie refines her graces, she gradually realizes that not only will Drouet never marry her but that she doesn't want to marry him. She has grown beyond him and grown weary of her living situation with him.Enter Hurstwood, a more sophisticated man who, unbeknownst to Carrie, is married with two children. Hurstwood has lived all his life by the rules, acquiring status marrying an attractive woman, having two promising children, and slowly amassing wealth -- all goals pursued and attained. He meets Carrie, who makes him realize how unhappy his marriage is and how unnecessary his presence at home is. His children barely respect him, let alone love him. They start a love affair that is discovered accidentally by Mrs. Hurstwood and Drouet. Once Drouet tells Carrie Hurstwood is married, she's hit by the harsh reality of her unhappy situation with the feckless Drouet and the lying Hurstwood. She yearns to leave Chicago to start again.In a sense, Hurstwood and Carrie are each other's impetus for eventually fleeing for New York. But whereas the young and vital Carrie ultimately finds independence and success in New York, the much older Hurstwood discovers belatedly that New York is the beginning of a physical and mental decline for him.There are many explorations of intriguing human foibles in this novel: ego (Carrie's ego tells her she is \\"better\\" than the factory girls she worked with, better than her sister and brother-in-law, and thus her belief that she should not be forced to do hard labor; to some extent Drouet's ego which occasionally deludes him into thinking he will do the honorable thing and marry Carrie but which ultimately convinces him that he is too charming to settle down with just one woman; Hurstwood's ego which stops him from seeking work beneath his dignified position in Chicago and leads him to lingering unemployment and finally poverty and despair), the fascinating mental descent of, happiness and the moving goalpost by which happiness is defined.Also interesting is Carrie's singlehood after achieving independence. She has at this point found her ideal man, but Dreiser doesn't allow his heroine to find love at the end of the story. Why? Is Carrie afraid that she'll be disillusioned yet again by her latest idea of the perfect man or is she somehow not allowed to find happiness?What many have declared as revolutionary is Carrie's success (but not happiness) at the end of the book despite her amorality as defined by 19th century society. I suppose Dreiser's refusal to punish Carrie, as Tolstoy does to Anna Karenin, is a major departure from literature as the final judgment on failed characters. However, the story is almost too indifferent to societal criticisms. A modern reader of today wouldn't be shocked terribly by Carrie's decisions. So in order to understand fully how revolutionary the book is, the reader has to keep in mind the times in which the book was written. What might have been more effective would have been for Dreiser to heap occasional societal scorn on Carrie but ultimately allow her to succeed despite society's disapproval.Overall though, the book is very well written and completely engaging."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it is an oldsaying that everyone should take heed of. Carrie is a girl who desires money and new apparel. She comes from an average financial family and feels this isn't sufficient enough for her. She uses two men, Drouet and Hurstwood to achieve her dreams. All the characters of the novel were real and dealt with real life problems. Carrie, in the beginning, needed to pay board and get a job. Although she did not like the job, she still had to have the money to live. This was also true with most of the othercharacters. They were very relatable because you can identify with their problems. Even though they had they share of predicaments, there was not any suspense or major problem that had to be dealt with. Basically, thiswas a novel about the story of Carrie's life away from home. Sure, she had little troubles but nothing that would make you read on the edge of your seat. Even though at the end of the novel she was without problems and had what she wanted, she was not happy. She wished for money and to be like the upper class, and unquestionably she got it, but she didn't have anyone to share it with. Theodore Dreiser's, Sister Carrie, had no real plot or suspense in it. All in all, I enjoyed the novel, but he could have made it more interesting for the reader to read by putting in elements of suspense."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"It's a big world. We all don't enjoy the same pleaures and we certainly all don't like the same books. I read &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; about ten years ago. I still remember it vividly. Many times since then, I have thought about the characters in it, and what they did, so it's a bit of a surprise to see that some other readers despised it. I wonder what they've read that they liked and if I would like those books. I recommend &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; and Dreiser's other great novel &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; for those who try to understand what motivates us as we live our lives. It is just the circumstances we find ourselves in by chance or are their irresistable forces that drive us?"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"You're not happy -- so you do something about it. To make yourself happy, you compete with others and the strongest will survive. Hints of Darwinian thought mix with Dreiser's own opinions on society as the reader follows the tale of Carrie and Hurstwood. Carrie goes to the city from the country and proceeds to work her way up in life. Hurstwood begins in a good position yet makes a tragic choice to end up down in life. The strongest survive in the city, and Dreiser's characters are all trying to survive. Works laced with determinism are not the most fun to read, but often have very important things to say about society. Sister Carrie is a profound book and well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I read this book a few years ago.

Much like Dubus' House of Sand and Fog, we find a story in which the dilemma(s) are wholly interesting, but the characters are impossible to sympathize with, Carrie especially. Okay, I'll admit, I had a pang of feeling for Hurstwood toward the end, but even he is too much of a horse's ass to take seriously. Every character's favorite phrase is \\"I don't know,\\" and it is true. None of them have any clue. It's all about surfaces/appearances. This is what the characters live for. They are all shallow and pathetic...and somehow, Dreiser still manages to deliver a good read---you know what they say about a train wreck... The fact of the matter is, the characters have no substance; they care too much about getting ahead to think about consequences. I once read that this novel was a favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald (my all time favorite author). AFter having finished it, and comparing it to some of Fitzgerald's own shallow, self-absorbed characters, I can see why.This is a book that you will love to hate, at least as far as the main \\"players\\" are concerned. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I would never want to meet a Carrie, Hurstwood or Drouet in person :)"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser portrays the different lifestyles of the turn of the century. I think the main theme of this book is greed. The characters will do anything for money even jeopardize their relationships. The main character, Carrie, even leaves her family to go find money. She moves to Chicago to find work, which will end up being wealth for her. During this time large cities such as Chicago were places of great economic growth. They were full of factories. A fair amount of unwed women were working in these dirty factories to make around $6 a week. This money was just enough for food, rent, and maybe some odds and end stuff but definitely not enough for a young woman to be happy.During this time, and like today, people are judged by how much money they have. People will stare and know if you are of a lower class than them or of a higher and then they envy you. Your clothes play a big role in distinguishing between the different classes of wealth. Carrie hated her life as being in the poor class and wanted bigger and better things for herself and she knew the only way for that was with money.She gets in with two guys and we know she is just in it for the money. They are using her for her body and she is using them for their money. Both are forms of prostitution. They take care of the bills and by that then they own her and can do whatever they want. She is always acting. She is never a \\"genuine\\" character. She knows what kind of woman these high risers like and that's what she portrays herself as.Her acting continues throughout her life and never ends. She is used for her beauty and never for anything else. I think we as the readers know more about her life and what she is doing to it rather than she does. Even at the end of the story she doesn't know what her life means. She is lonely and doesn't understand why.This book is good but can drag on at times. The middle is a little dreary but perks up at the end. I enjoyed reading it especially with it being a historical fiction. Dreiser does a great job showing what life was really like at the turn of the century. The great moral of the story to me is that wanting is fine but if it interferes with the rest of your life is not worth wanting."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is a lovely book.

As a result a book that was once a critical document of patterns of behavior of some of the author's contemporaries has become, for better or worse, an important historical chronical of the dangers of selfishness and uninhibited personal ambition. Oh, the story is no longer anything unfamiliar, but the grounding and the character studies make this book very affecting and, true to the ideals of its unfortunate literary designation of 'Naturalism' (a meaningless term which limits instead of explains a readers' expectation, much in the way that science-fiction or horror classify something as not necessisarily what it in fact is), this is a very believable and realistic story.The writing itself, as other readers and critics throughout the past one hundred years or so have repeated when attempting to find fault with Sister Carrie, isn't the most impressive thing about the book. However, in its defense, the cut and dry, occasionally pasted on moments of philosophical conversation and the rugged and perhaps at times inconsistant speech patterns of the various characters somehow, for me, created an even more believable picture, zoning in on those people who attempt to speak both above and beneath their social class and educational backgrounds for either personal gain or in a futile effort to 'fit in'.A wonderful book, because of its flaws, in fact, that reads like a quick-paced and absorbing tale always on the verge of tragedy. That tension, that what-will-happen-next feeling pervades throughout the book and concludes by providing quite an impact indeed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"After reading a few Edith Wharton novels and becoming interested in late Victorian literature, I found Sister Carrie and decided to buy it based on the reviews here - I'm so glad I did.This is a truly fascinating story of the decline of one person and the ascent of another. I guess the fact that after 100+ years it is still so riveting is the reason it's a classic. This is by far the best book I've read recently.I guess if I were to offer one complaint, it would be the amount of theorizing and postulating that Dreiser does concerning human nature - it bogs the story down a bit at times, but this is a minor annoyance for me. It's one of the few books that I know I'll read again. Definitely worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This Kindle edition is missing words and has words wrong in the first paragraph! However, there is another free version with a melon colored cover that is OK."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" is a novel that I happened upon accidently. I ordered it when I thought I was ordering another and it was delivered to my door. Since it was recommended for a creative writing class, I figured I might as well read it since I love a long, epic novel. Little did I know what I was getting into.Carrie reads abruptly Brittish at first, with all the proper nouns and pronouns making it seem, straight away, like a snobbish and bourgoise book. Once I got past the first few pages, however, I was at once intrigued and secretly invited to hear, not read, the tale of an original fem fatale.As I read, I could actually hear the dialog and ambience of the era, horse-drawn carriages, the buzz of a cafes, restaurants and lodges. And, of course, the rather brutish brother-in-law whom Carrie encounters as an adversary when she moves to Chicago in the late 1800's.The novel was the first for author, Theodore Dreiser, who later went on the write, \\"An American Tragedy\\", in 1925 a novel that brought universal acclaim.\\"Carrie\\" reads with the striking atmosphere of a completely different set of rules and behavior standards and though, the language is a little outdated, it still tells the story of a young woman's plight of constant rejection during a time of very strict ideals set on single and married women. Her's is a fairy tale of seeming immediate acceptance with dreadful undertones of ownership and emotional abuse.I'm incredibly challenged with the style and verbose writing of Mr. Dreiser and confident that a movie is sure to be in the works. A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"When I finished reading Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel, \\"Sister Carrie,\\" I wrote in the margin, \\"We live in a depressing fiasco of a country.\\" This is to detract nothing from Dreiser's novel - it's just that the problems Dreiser outlines in \\"Sister Carrie\\" are problems, material and epistemological, that remain with us, unabated, over a century later. If contemporary novels like Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and Butler's \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" signal the end of the Victorian era, Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" certainly foreshadows the preoccupations of the 20th century. Dreiser's narrator has a detachment and yet a cynicism which inflects the story of a young girl from rural Wisconsin trying to find happiness in Chicago and New York.\\"Sister Carrie\\" begins as the eponymous heroine, Caroline Meeber, hurtles forth on a train from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to her sister in Chicago. Ostensibly, she is going to find a menial job and support herself under the protection of her sister and her sister's husband. On the train, she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, who is captivated by her. Arriving in the growing metropolis, Carrie has a world of difficulty adjusting to the drudgery of working and living with her joyless relatives. As the novel gets underway, with industry too consumptive of her individuality and her ideals, Carrie is swept off by Drouet, becoming his mistress, and leaving her sister. Through her association with Drouet, and subsequently, his friend, the respected resort manager, George Hurstwood, Carrie struggless to negotiate her ambitions and desires in the context of these two promising, but unfulfilling relationships.One thing permanently at the forefront of Dreiser's novel is money - how one gets it, who has it, what they do with it, and all the complications and frustrations that come from having too much or barely enough to survive. Dreiser opens up to us a world of widely varied economic circumstances, from the utterly abject homeless, to the 'scab' day-laborers during a public transit strike, to factory-girls, to resort managers, business owners, and seemingly everything in between. He also underscores the perceptible, and growing, disparity between subsistence and success, between respectability and celebrity. The differences that Carrie and Hurstwood, in their adventures together in Montreal and New York, perceive between getting by and really living, are some of the most excruciatingly rendered and pathos-riddled passages in the novel.The understated sexual relationships in the novel, and Carrie's status through most of the novel as a kept-woman/mistress, first to Drouet, then to Hurstwood, was of course shocking to the novel's first readers. However, as there is nothing explicit in the novel, we must read beneath the surface, seeing the novel's relationships, as both the narrator and Carrie see them - as means to an end, to fiscal comfort and social respectability. Also in these relationships, we can gauge the dynamics of gender relations in the first years of the 20th century - the narrator's insistence throughout the novel on \\"how women are\\" or references to individual characters as \\"types\\" of universal categories. Through all of this, we come to suspect the narrator, and must learn to judge Carrie and her escapades with those she encounters (Mrs. Vance, Lola Osborne, Robert Ames) on how Carrie herself might view them.Despite the wholeheartedly depressing tone of the novel as a whole, I think one positive, though qualified, means of redemption Dreiser leaves us with is the possibly transformative effects of journalistic and artistic production. Reading is something the characters in the novel do a lot of, and here too, there is a distinction drawn between what we can get from the written word. Dreiser seems to imply throughout the novel that through the word, written and performative, some greater relationship can be established between people - that something truly apocalyptic can be brought about by reading the right books or seeing the right plays. This is one of Dreiser's great achievements as far as I am concerned - \\"Sister Carrie,\\" if we can read beyond the devastating hopelessness of it all, is a work that desperately wants us to connect with those around us, especially since Dreiser's own characters seem fundamentally unable to do so."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Dreiser is best known for \\"An American Tragedy,\\" which to my taste is one of the most boring books ever written. But Sister Carrie is a classic in the best sense of the word.Dreiser draws the reader back in time to turn of the century America, and immerses him completely in the hopes, fears, desires, and mores of that lost time. The now fading archetype of the travelling salesman as the dangerously seductive dandy despoiling virtuous young women comes to life here.Sound corny? Not in the least. Because Dreiser gets inside these people's heads, and they're just as interesting as anyone gracing the pages of People Magazine.The novel starts with a timeless theme, young girl goes to the big city and gets seduced by smooth travelling salesman. Every made for TV movie variation on this theme nowadays reduces this to a morality tale to warn young viewers.Not Dreiser. He turns this into what I'd argue is one of the first and least politically tainted feminist novels of the 20th century. Buy this book. It'll cost you half of the newest John Grisham or Stephen King novel, you'll be solidly entertained with page turning excitement, and you can brag to all your friends about the classic you just finished."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser was too scandalous in 1900 when it was originally published in a somewhat pared down version. Since then, Dreiser's original story has been restored and is hardly as scandalous by today's standards. It is a landmark work of naturalism, showing the rise of characters from poverty and the fall of the rich into despair due to egotistical decision making.Oddly enough, the title does not do the book justice, for the book is not solely about Carrie Meeber, a young woman from Wisconsin who hopes for a better life in Chicago. After securing factory work, she soon finds herself a kept woman, the mistress of Charles Drouet, a traveling salesman who routinely ingratiates himself with pretty women. While Carrie has more than she ever hoped for, she constantly yearns for greater things. When Drouet introduces her to his friend George Hurstwood, Hurstwood becomes obsessed with winning Carrie over. He is successful in his venture but not without injuring her through deceit and forever changing the course his life will follow. The rest of the novel is devoted to the hardships that Carrie and Hurstwood face when they move to New York and how the tide of fortunes change for both of them.Dreiser's story goes on far longer than it needs to, due to his moralizing strands inserted in an effort to pacify the more scandalous elements of his prose - an unmarried man and woman living together, shocking indeed for its time. Yet by the time the initial crisis of Carrie choosing between the two men arrives, it feels as if all of the story has been told. The middle section of the novel drags and while it is an easy read, it is not easy to keep reading. The reader will care little about Carrie or the two men in her life. She is vapid and two-dimensional, driven by lust for wealth and fame, while the men are just as empty-headed and egotistical, conscious only of what a beautiful woman will do for their own ego.Dreiser managed to capture a lot of history in his novel, from Chicago's World Fair to strikes in the poor sections of New York City. He truly shows how environment determines one's fate and how it could be possible for one to rise above their station but not consider themselves happy or successful."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"There's nothing like good ol' American literature that you can just sink your teeth into. A brilliant illustration of a period in history with characters and situations that not only give meaning to today, but also embody a dark period in American History (the Gilded Age of Robber Barons and sweatshops). Carrie becomes the toy of two men, whom she eventually uses as her stepping stones out of the sweatshop and onto the stage and a life of ease and rich trinkets. The world of poverty and the \\"walled city\\" of riches are portrayed as symbols of the breakdown and failure of the American Dream for the first time in American history. Driesler's novel is no moral tale, but a naturalistic, amoral illustration of American lives. Brilliant novel, wonderful prose, introspective into fascinating and realistic characters against a desperate, tragic, urban landscape of the end of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The narrator who reads this book uses very little inflection and has an irritating voice to boot. Being an auditory learner, I prefer to listen to books over reading the words; this reader makes it almost painful. Since the material itself is far from scintillating, the reader could make up the difference with a good reading with lots of inflection and characterization, but she doesn't. Blah!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\", to begin with, is written in a most curious fashion. Theodore Dreiser, an author I'd never heard of before, writes in a very interesting and distinct style. Some would probably feel frustrated with it, as well as his rather blunt way of writing, but it's rather different and certainly good.A story of a girl's slow and steady rise, \\"Sister Carrie\\" will capture readers first with its intrigue. Obviously, the idea of young Carrie whisked away to the city and within moments as a wealthier man's \\"wife\\", will have raised a few eyebrows. The way her life progresses is interesting too, from extremely low, to good, to almost better off, to bad, to better, and then finally to excellent. Her personality, though relatively static, is curious to follow as well. At first, as a meek, shy, pretty girl, she gives off the very image of chastity. At the end, she is a strong, independent woman. The change is slow, and yet Carrie does not ultimately change all that much.Above all, though, it's a great read. It's written in such a way that's easy to read, and though there are the usual dry spots of an early 20th century novel, it reads well. Characters are impressive in their realistic qualities - their weaknesses, their faults, their virtues and their beliefs. The story progresses smoothly and will keep the reader hooked.A great read, cool writing, and a curious story. All in all, a pretty awesome book. I wish I'd found it sooner. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Here is a snapshot, written by a journalist, of Chicago and New York of 110 years ago. Dreiser had never read American \\"naturalist\\" novels before he wrote this one, but had been heavily influenced by his newspaper reporting and by Balzac. What we have here is social and political messages delivered in the context of the life of a young, idealistic woman who comes to Chicago to escape the boredom of a small town and to make her way in the world. I'm reminded of the book Devil in the White City and how it emphasizes all the young women who flocked to Chicago in the 1880s and 1890s, in awe of that booming city's majesty and bustle and life. What Carrie finds, however, is utter indifference and misery until a man sets her up in a \\"love nest.\\" What a scandal! This story was controversial in its day and portions of the original manuscript were cut in order to prevent an even bigger outcry. Soon Carrie grows weary of her lover and is taken with the true tragic figure in this story, a successful married man named Hurstwood. Hurstwood falls in love with Carrie and blows his whole life up for that love. All of this is based on the true story of Dreiser's own sister, but Dreiser has embellished this squalid little tale to give us the demise of a man in minute and realistic detail, all the while commenting on the meaning of success, material well being, and what happiness is all about. This would all be trite if it weren't framed in journalistic realism. Carrie ends up a smashing \\"success\\" in the theater, but never finds true contentment, nor do any of the main characters. Question: What is the good life? Answer: It comes from internal sources, not external materialistic ones. But money, nevertheless, helps along the way to provide the leisure time to even contemplate this question.Dreiser gives us an excellent portrait of what women's choices were at the turn of the nineteenth century. Without looks, talent, or extraordinary intellect, women were out of luck. Even with such assets, women depended entirely on men for their financial well being. Dreiser makes this crystal clear in this work, which was way ahead of its time.The corrosive depression that Hurstwood suffers in the last third of this work is haunting, but the scenes of old New York hark to today's downtown New York, south of 34th Street, where you can still see the buildings Dreiser describes as well as the hard-luck homeless in the streets.This is a unique American novel, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Wow! My family book club read Sister Carrie immediately after finishing a book about another Carrie -- Carol Kennicott of Main Street. What a great pair of books to read together.I found Sister Carrie to be even more readable than Main Street. To me, this book read much like a soap opera. The girl who \\"works\\" her way from rags to riches, the tormented (or tormenting?) men she leaves behind.This is a GREAT book for discussion, because we found that what we thought about these characters changed with each chapter. We also spent some time trying to figure out what the chapter titles. The \\"tinder box\\" theme was especially delicious.Sister Carrie was the type of book that you have a hard time putting down. What will happen next? Our group predicted and changed our minds a hundred times.I think this novel about a young woman's venture from country life into the city and all of the people she affects is definitely one most anyone would enjoy. I especially recommend reading it in comparison to Main Street, in which the opposite happens - a girl moves from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota.Also like Main Street, Dreiser uses personal experiences in Sister Carrie. In fact, the introduction by Richard Lingeman in the Signet edition was especially interesting to me. I recommend reading it after you've read Sister Carrie. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This book is an interesting commentary on class relations at the beginning of the 20th century. Having been written at the time, I never got the impression that the author was stretching to capture the ethos of the period. The story of a girl leaving home life to escape poverty and experiencing many changes is one that can also be seen in Hardy's Tess D'Ubervilles and Shaw's Pigmalion. In fact, the author was influenced by those authors. The evolution of the characters is delicately written and extremely convincing. My one complaint would be that the characters are somewhat transparent in terms of their emotions and desires."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Dreiser was only in his 20's when he created &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; - that is what, perhaps, amazes me the most. At such a young age he has already learned what many take much longer to surmise (e.g. the characters in this book), and some never learn for as long as they live. It's difficult to consider Carrie the protagonist in my view, as her shallowness was the main contributer to the utter and complete downfall one of the more likable characters in the book: George Hurstwood, whose love of her let to ultimate poverty. That is, in fact, my one complaint and what has prevented this work from being a &quot;5 star&quot; novel. I simply had trouble believing that the cunning, charming, affluent, and brilliant Hurstwood would not only rob Fitzgerald and Moy, but that he would eventually dissolve into utter laziness, as if a man of his worldliness couldn't have overcome the relatively benign obstacles placed before him. He was a horse one chapter, and a lazy mutt the next. There needed to be a longer and more believable transition period, but beyond that - this is an enjoyable yarn, a &quot;must&quot; for those whose interest lies in turn of the century literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie is a wonderful novel to read, especially for those interested in stories about the past and women. This turn of the century novel, which was highly controversial at its time, contains truths that pertain to people at all times and for all ages. Dreiser does an excellent job of making the reader feel as if he is a part of the industrialized, late 19th century America. But he does an even better job of creating a sense of the details of the setting. Everything a character is seeing the reader is able to see just as well. Dreiser uses a great deal of imagery to communicate the characters' visions of even the finest details. This can also be said in regard to the characters' feelings and thoughts. Dreiser carries the reader into the deepest realms of the minds of the central characters. For this, Dreiser uses many symbols and metaphors to follow the characters' successes, failures, and motives. Although Dreiser is inarticulate at times and far too wordy at others, the effect of the novel still comes through. Dreiser also inserts many of his own philosophies into the novel and at times they come across as lectures to the reader. But by doing this, Dreiser has clearly become just as involved with his characters as he makes the reader. This is one of those books in which it's message, more than presentation, will stay with the reader for weeks after its completion. So despite the nagging criticisms of Dreiser's critical contemporaries, he still skillfully wrote the story of a young girl's struggle to succeed in America and her attempts to overcome any obstacles that would try to stop her."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I finally got around to reading something by Dreiser, namely Sister Carrie. A friend raved it up about 20 years ago. The pink-covered old battered Bantam paperback he read is the same one I'm reading now. I'm only half-way through it, but I'm enjoying its grim working out of these characters' destinies. They are a rather hopeless bunch, but what fascinates me is how Dreiser brilliantly evokes the state of unhappiness and how quickly happiness can go sour and how impossible it is to hold onto happiness for any length of time, especially when people seek to base it on empty premises, as these characters do. Incidentally, I began to wonder if the great Tennessee Williams was inspired by Sister Carrie's opening when he wrote A Streetcar Named Desire. The early scenes are eerily like the one where poor Blanche DuBois steps off the streetcar and looks for the tenement where her sister lives. The big-city atmospherics, the weather, the buildings, the lonely crowds in Sister Carrie are very well done, very vivid. Dreiser is a real clutz of a writer, stylistically, and yet he manages to bring all of this off with undeniable hellish power. It's fun, now and then, to read one of these naturalistic, turn-of-the-century grim, doomy books. It's amazing how little human behavior changes. We see the same materialistic grasping, the self-centered greed and lust, and the same sorts people with so little insight into themselves in wandering lost in todays' world. That's another good reason for reading Sister Carrie. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Somewhere in the depths of time a critic once labeled playwright Eugene O'Neill a genius with no talent. It's a description that could just as easily fit Theodore Dreiser, an uneducated, mercurial man who, while still in his twenties, and with virtually no experience composing fiction, managed to crank out what I consider one of the greatest novels in American literature. Very few authors have ever managed to generate the raw power that Dreiser does over the 500 or so pages of &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; It is amazing how much of the human experience he has put into this book, how well he understands the hopes, fears, and desires--mysterious and contradictory as they often are--that drive ordinary people.The conventional judgment on Dreiser puts him in the naturalistic, social-realist tradition of Zola and Hardy. There is much in this; but I think his real strength lies in depicting character--Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet really come alive in these pages. His characters possess a depth and complexity of feeling that one rarely finds in fiction. Dreiser has a melancholy, fatalistic sense that the world may be too vast and impersonal for people to live in it comfortably, and yet his world is vibrantly human as well.I personally find Carrie a more likable heroine (if you could call her that) than many readers have. She is self-absorbed, yes, but also capable of compassion for others, and she is never intentionally cruel. Like all of Dreiser's characters she is somewhere between the angels and the devils.This is by no means a perfect book. Dreiser's rhetorical flourishes can become absolutely ridiculous, and so can his habit of injecting philosophical commentary into the texture of the narrative. But the total effect of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is powerful, and more than compensates for any defects in the novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"It is no mystery why Frank Norris praised to high heaven Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel \\"Sister Carrie.\\" Norris, one of America's great naturalist writers, saw in Dreiser's tale about a young woman on the make a reflection of the same bleak vistas he wrote about in \\"Vandover and the Brute,\\" \\"The Octopus,\\" and \\"McTeague.\\" When Dreiser submitted his book for publication, it was Norris who read the book and made a glowing recommendation to the publisher. There were immense problems with \\"Sister Carrie\\" from that point forward: the wife of the publisher hated the story and worked hard behind the scenes to prevent its release. With a contract already signed, Dreiser's book did become a reality but the publishing house refused to support it with any marketing. The story languished for years in a paper limbo before finally emerging to great success and acclaim. Thank goodness it did because this may be one of the most powerful books ever written about social climbing and the perils of bad morals. Dreiser went on to publish more novels (American Tragedy, The Financier) before dropping out of the literary scene and converting to communism before his death in 1945.\\"Sister Carrie\\" doesn't promise much at the beginning. In fact, this is yet another story about a rural person arriving in the big city seeking fame and fortune. In this case, it is Carrie Meeber, a young woman moving to Chicago to live with her sister and her husband while she tries to find work. Carrie quickly discovers big city life is tough; her sister's home life bores her to death, the work she finds in a shoe factory is pure drudgery, and she doesn't have enough money to buy decent clothes because she has to pay her sister four dollars a week for rent. Carrie hates her base co-workers and spends most of her free time watching people pass on the street outside of her sister's apartment. When Carrie loses her job after an illness, it looks like she will have to return home to Columbia City and forget about her dreams in Chicago.Enter George Drouet, a semi-successful salesman with a voracious appetite for the ladies. George finagled Carrie's address when he met her on the train into Chicago, and now the two meet again by chance. The results of this meeting shape the rest of the book. Carrie abandons her sister's lodgings and becomes \\"kept\\" by George. It is during this period that Carrie meets George Hurstwood, the wealthy manager of a fancy Chicago tavern and friend of Drouet. Through a series of misunderstandings about the marriage status of Carrie and Hurstwood, and serious lapses in moral judgments, Hurstwood and Carrie move on to bigger and better things in New York City.It is at this point that Norris must have began enthusing, for Dreiser embarks on a harrowing tour through the destruction of a human being's body and soul. Just when you think a person could sink no lower, Dreiser yanks you back to reality and illustrates for you just how bad things can get before the inevitable occurs. When the author contrasts the utter humiliation of one character with the elevation in status of another, the tension becomes too much to bear. This novel is painful to read, but at the same time it is so riveting it is nearly impossible to put it down. We've all seen or known people who suffered the fates revealed in this story, or at least I have, and that makes it even more chillingly realistic. How Dreiser managed to capture the feel of his characters' lives is a mystery, but that is what makes this book great literature; it is timeless in its examination of the inner workings of the human soul.\\"Sister Carrie\\" is classic literature, but that does not mean there are not problems with the story. Dreiser's prose takes some getting used to before it starts to flow. In fact, this may be the best book I have ever read where the prose is often mediocre. I told one person that the author's style reminded me of an intoxicated welder, and I still believe that to be the case for most of the book. Dreiser has a tendency to jam his sentences together into an unwieldy mix of clauses and commas. After a few hundred pages this hardly seems to matter but it could provide a reason for someone just starting the book to quit reading it. Do not quit, however, because the story ends up being so good that the stylistic problems quickly fade into insignificance.Another difficulty involves the middle portion of the story, when Carrie, Drouet, and Hurstwood vie for position with each other. These chapters appreciably drag while providing no clues about the goldmine that soon follows. Looking at the story as a whole, I understand now why these chapters were necessary but I didn't while I was reading them. Again, do not give up too soon lest you miss out on the extraordinary buildup to the soul shattering conclusion.Ultimately, the messages conveyed by Dreiser outweigh the dual problems of prose and a few plodding chapters. The scandalous behavior the author wrote about angered many during his time because people believed that divorce, infidelity, loose morals, and social positioning were things better talked about privately than brought out in the open. The fact that Dreiser wrote such things without delivering a blistering rebuke about such behaviors also stunned society. Perhaps it is not too far off to say that Theodore Dreiser was the Jerry Springer of his generation, merely revealing things that everyone knew happened behind closed doors. Whatever the case may be, \\"Sister Carrie\\" is sheer brilliance. I was so fired up after reading this book that I went right out and got \\"American Tragedy.\\" I now understand why Frank Norris went into paroxysms of delight about Dreiser's book."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This edition, which was prepared by volunteers, contains numerous errors, dropped words and punctuations, misspellings, wrong tenses, etc. It was so annoying to read that I purchased the Modern Library edition ($3.50) after about 75 pages.

Sister Carrie is a beautifully written and fascinating tale of how one climbs and descends the social ladder of life. I am aware that some readers have criticized this book stating that Dreiser did not develop the characters very well and that Carrie was not very likeable. Well, it is my thought that Dreiser never intended for us to become solely wrapped within the characters. He meant for us to become enveloped in the circumstance. The two main characters, Carrie and Hurstwood, are truly victims of circumstance - Carrie's never-ending unhappiness and Hurstwood's downward spiral. As we go through life, there are so many events and choices that will guide our lives to what they are. When one stops and thinks about this, it is really quite fascinating. I believe Dreiser r was aware of this aspect of life and he wanted to write a novel that would effect the lives of everyone who reads it. I read the entire book in 3 days. I simply could not put it down. I recommend Sister Carrie to everyone. It will leave you thinking and thinking and thinking."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The constant typos in this edition ruin Dreiser's literary style. I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I sometimes fear that novels heralded as &quot;classics&quot; may have been great in their time, but no longer have as much wallop. That was my prejudice approaching &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; I'd read &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; years ago and was impressed, though not as much as I'd been led to believe. Thus, I wondered whether Dreiser's &quot;second most famous&quot; novel would be worth the effort. It was. Although firmly set in its time, it is not dated, and the book moves briskly from start to finish. The characters are well drawn, and I found myself drawn into their stories and the choices they made, with the consequences laid out as the novel progresses. Dreiser manages to convey the gritty reality of living in Chicago and New York at the turn of the last century, with the contrasts between wealth and poverty so pronounced. His attention to detail makes the scenes come alive, and he tells the story without being didactic or preachy. For example, there is an episode involving a streetcar strike, which the author tells in a way that makes clear his own political views, yet those views are not crammed down the reader's throat.This one is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"As I have aged, and become aware of the time left in life, I have returned to reading classic books that I read in high school, or overlooked for popular fiction works of today. And am I glad I did. When in high school, we read Dreiser's American Tragedy, and I remember being one of the few who loved it. I felt it reached me as a teenager as no other book ever had, and to this day it is one of my few favorite books of all time (then again I love American Romantic Period paintings, and not many people I know do, so maybe it's just my taste). Anyway, Sister Carrie is new to me, and I love it. Of all the books that explain women's true feelings that I have read, this is one of the best. I think it still holds true for many women...circumstances may be different, but the feelings remain the same. If you want to understand the woman in your life, study Carrie. And the path of the male character is astoundingly real, even today. It is a thoughtful book that warrants everyone's attention. And added benefit...the language is beautiful. Writers from our past used words in ways to describe the world that I have rarely read in modern times...you can feel the wind through the trees, sense the depression of winter days, understand the inner feelings of characters far better than much put into books today provides. I have read far too many books today in which action takes precedence over character. Read Dreiser, or Dickens, or Hardy, or Austen and then try a modern book..its shocking how little the new books can hold you after the experience. SISTER CARRIE is worth your time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I just finished reading the book \\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser (1900). This book was a good, easy read and is strangely still current, even though it was written over a hundred years ago. With the economy the way it is it seems that not much has changed, except perhaps the value of money. Carrie's desire to be in the city, as well as her experiences with men who claim they love her are realistic, modern and honest. I recommend this book to people interested in realistic fiction and coming of age stories; also to people who like reading stories about the mid-west-- Carrie is from Wisconsin and moves to Chicago, then travels to New York City by way of Detroit."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"My mother told me to read this book about ten years ago when I was the same age as Carrie. I rarely listened to her, (I do now, always listen to your mother!) so she read me the first few lines, and I had to pick it up: something about a girl of eighteen and how she might fare alone in nineteenth century Chicago intrigued me. There was a hint that she might go bad! So of course I had to pick it up. Besides, I'll read almost anything, which you can see from my various reviews. I found I couldn't put it down.This is a great melodrama about a harsh and sprawling metropolis at the turn of the century, and like Dreiser's other work, it's also a story of the viciousness Darwinian nature of capitalism. In this case, he looks at the story through the eyes of a pretty young woman who comes to the city by herself-young Carrie, called \\"sister Carrie\\" in homey fashion by her rural family, to show the sweet origins of what ultimately becomes a not-so-respectable woman.Carrie, trying to become an \\"actress\\", relies on sexuality to survive. It's suggested that she doesn't have much of a choice, and that everyone is for sale in the city. Preyed on by more sophisticated men, she ultimately becomes successful in her own right. This leaves us with a sort of confusion-we've grown to symapthize with Carrie and understand her behavior is a survival mechanism, but she is also callous and begins to change from victim to conniver. At the end, we aren't sure whether to cheer her triumph, or feel bad for those she's left in her wake.Another entertaning, great Dreiser story that will teach you about American urban history, not to mention keep you turning the pages in great suspense as to what will become of lovely young Carrie. Thanks, Mom!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Anyone reading a review of Sister Carrie probably knows the story and the literary significance of the novel as a seminal work in the Naturalist school, so i'll skip that. Most important note is on this Kindle edition. It is riddled with typos and errors. It is very difficult to follow. I would recommend you hunt around for another edition or check another platform for your free download of this American classic of the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I have just finished reading Sister Carrie, and until the very last pages I was constantly trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes! If there has ever been an overrated writer Dreiser is him! Constantly trying to add more details than are needed for a complete understanding of the characters' lives, Dreiser attempts to trap us in their minds--and that is not a place you will want to be. Instead of making us enjoy the characters and feel sorry for them, he makes us wish them to die suddenly on the next page! What an upset!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The story of characters deeply entwined and studied in depth.

Theodore Dreiser is an engaging writer. He wrote about a woman who did not conform to the Victorian mentality.

She was not the victim of this book but I did not perceive her as the heroine, either. She certainly knew how to use men."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"As in An American Tragedy, in Sister Carrie Dreiser sets the reader up for a long, excruciating slide downhill for the lovely, unsuspecting female victim of his story. Late 19th-century Chicago blusters and glimmers, and we know that it was a very different time than the one we live in. Roles and types abound in Dreiser's world; a nice place to visit, no doubt, but who would want to live in it?"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Free on Kindle was an awesome deal for a required text for ENG 661 at Morehead State University over Summer 2012.

I really liked it. Carrie is riddled with faults, but she manages to believe in herselve during hard times, and she persists. The reader is happy by her successes. An interesting look at what makes some rise and others fall. Hooray!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is a marvelous story. Dreiser has created a fascinating heroine. She, like Zola's Nana, makes her living off of other people. However, Carrie is a sympathetic character where Nana is not. Carrie brings down the men with whom she consorts in much the same way as Nana. Both girls are actresses, though Carrie has true talent while Nana makes it on the thrust of her hip. Carrie has only a few more virtues and redeeming qualities than did Nana, but I at least was just as overjoyed at Carrie's success in the theatre as I was satisfied at Nana's revolting end. This is a sign of how well written Sister Carrie is. Dreiser has taken a potentially weak or even vile (with different writing) character, and made her into quite the heroine! A wonderful read-I sat down one night and finished it at three in the morning-I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Carrie never really overcame her bad characteristics, and she did ruin a few lives, but her ending was perfect. I think somehting should have been done to make up for that, but that's strictly personal opinion. It's still five stars despite that!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This novel hooked me from the first page - who can forget the opening scene where the young Caroline Meeber is &quot;spotted&quot; by the travelling salesman Charles Drouet on the Chicago-bound train? We follow in this novel two seemingly irreversible life flows: Carrie uses her beauty and ambition to rise in life, and Hurstwood falls from his secure position of middle-aged, upper-middle-class success to utter failure, all for the love of a woman half his age. It's the stuff of melodrama to some, but not when handled by Dreiser, who takes the reader into a vividly realized urban world with well-drawn characters whose virtues and vices are equally on display. You leave the book feeling that Carrie and Hurtstwood could very easily have stepped out of the pages of today's newspapers, such is the zone of uncomfortable truth inhabited by the denizens of this brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I found this novel very intriguing and moving. The symbols and representations are very analytical. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; causes one to think twice about oneself, and to reconsider one's own definition of true happiness and success. It shows one how society can influence one to think in the manner in which one does. The characters face good times and bad times and experience true tests of strength and survival. The results are both well developed and interesting to discover. It is difficult to put the book down. When reading this novel one must understand the sybolism and look deep into the context to acquire the meanings of it. Another interesting fact about this novel is that Theodore Dreiser actually wrote the novel in the year 1900. I am a junior in high school and I strongly recomend the reading of this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sometimes free is too expensive. A brief sample:\\"It was all wonderful, all mast, all far removed, and she sank in spirit inwardly and fluttered feebly as of the heart as she though of enter any one of these mighty concerns and asking for something to do something that she could do anything.\\"This is apparently an American book translated into Chinese, and then re-translated back into English. Or something of which I can maybe not be understanding to do with anything."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"One of the reasons why Sister Carrie is worth reading has to do with the ending. If you've read any of these famous home-wrecking novels, where a young beautiful girl gets involved with an older man, and wondered if suicide always had to be the answer, here's your book. But surprisingly, the ending makes you sort of long for the good old suicide ending. Sister Carrie isn't bad, but a lot of the insights into human nature and society are expressed in the language of a talk-show self-help psychiatrist rather than a great author. There are better versions of this formula (Updike, Tolstoy, Wharton, Austen) but there is still something in Sister Carrie that makes it worth reading. Despite its title, the better character depiction in the book belongs to the lover rather than the heroine of the title. Like Updike, Dreiser makes you feel for the plight of the upper-middle class white man. And I mean that seriously, with no sarcasm."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I was so excited to be able to download this work by Theodore Dreiser, from Amazon. However, when I started to read the story, I found that the formatting of this Kindle edition book was terrible. Words were spelled incorrectly and even grammar was incorrect.

From the very first page I was immediately so caught up in the story that I read 220 pages the first night and only stopped reading when I was too sleepy to continue. This is a fine story that keeps getting better and better as it progresses. I loved every word of it!There are three memorable characters in the book. The first is Carrie herself, a young woman who comes to the big city of Chicago at the age of 18. Her quest for a job and the challenges of working in a factory are clearly brought to light. I pitied her situation and was actually rather glad when the prosperous salesman, Drouet seduces her and she seems to better herself. He's not into marrying her but he supports her and treats her well. She even gets a chance to take part in a play that his lodge is putting on. There's another man who is interested in her though, Hurstwood. He is a manager of a prosperous restaurant-bar and has a good life. Even though he is married, he courts her. How this all turns out is the stuff of real drama.This book has it all, but most especially it is a deep exploration of character. Each of them is sympathetic in his or her own way. And they are depicted so well that I could view the world through their eyes and actually get under their skin. This is a powerful emotional story. It is as real as it can get and the cities of Chicago and New York are presented in ways that clearly impact the characters and the challenges they face.Don't miss this book if you can help it. It is a lush and real treat!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The novel, Sister Carrie, came about when the 28-year-old Theodore Dreiser wrote the words \\"Sister Carrie\\" on a sheet of paper, then composed the novel to figure out what it meant.It is the story of a young woman who moves to Chicago. Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried. From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses. Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book.This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone. It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century.The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial. Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations. Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start. But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"With his first novel \\"Sister Carrie\\", writer Theodore Dreiser put his name on the map. Much of his following success is due to this book. Much of what he wrote in this novel is based on facts that happened to his sisters. When he submitted the work to a publisher he almost got a contract - if not a publisher's wife had read the book and found it immoral.For being so candid about controversial issues, Dreiser was label as immoral - but, as a matter of fact, he was frank, touching current issues that other writers and society used to (or still do) avoid. This is one of the main reason for reading \\"Sister Carrie\\". Being an X-Ray of time like nothing else made this interesting book survive through time. And nowadays it is considered one of America's greatest classics. It is such an important book, that many critics and scholars consider it a the first modern American novel and has influenced writers like Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.Thematic was not the writer's main concern in \\"Sister Carrie\\". The use of language was ahead of its time. Dreiser was not afraid of incorporating slang to his text. For that, the book is a portrait of its time, how people behaved and talked - what makes the reading more interesting for contemporary readers. Although the language used was the one current when the novel was written it is never difficult for contemporary audiences. Moreover, the interesting plot and developed characters only make \\"Sister Carrie\\" very accessible.The plot tells the story of young Carrie, a girl who leaves her hometown to move to Chicago to live with her sister and find a decent job. But she has other plans. After attempting unglamorous jobs, she flees to live with a womanizer. But that is just the beginning of Carrie's journey down then up.Were it written by someone less talented, \\"Sister Carrie\\" would easily have become a soap opera. But Dreiser bring depth to his characters and situations. Carrie could have been only another 'a-star-is-born' type of character, but she is much more than that.So is Dreiser. With his following work (mostly with \\"An American Tragedy\\") he proved that \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not a fluke, but the conscious work of a talented writer. More than a hundred years later, his first novel is still read and very important to Literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This is the first Theodore Dreiser novel that I have read, and this proved to be a good place to start, being his debut work, written at the turn of the 20th century. Dreiser writes in a florid, descriptive type of way that takes a little getting accustomed to, but then establishes a groove. Let me give a word of warning: this is a very engrossing novel. It tells the story of Carrie, a young and impressionable girl of 18, who moves away from her small hometown to stay with her settled sister and brother-in-law in Chicago, and almost immediately (in fact, on the train journey to Chicago) makes an impression on a man, Drouet, with whom she would eventually develop a romantic relationship. That relationship sours when a more attractive prospect of a man appears within her sights, and she is in turn pursued by that man, Hurstwood. Both men are upper middle class achievers, both more than a little pretentious, but both smitten by Carrie, a plain Jane who becomes a beauty.The story encompasses her struggles with poverty and hardship, wanting desperately, having, and then losing it, only to regain it by her own pluck and ambition. We are, of course, referring to material gain. The themes in this story run very deep. We witness, in a very well told manner, the trappings of wealth, the comfort and predictability of it, and then the rapid decline in fortunes that Carrie endures with Hurstwood, a proud man who fails, and is struck down by both his obsession for, indifference to, and then ultimate reliance on Carrie, which would have seemed incredible in the early stages of their relationship. I found the story of Hurstwood to be moving in that he had been financially comfortable, married (albeit a predictable and dull marriage), with teenage children; and then out of perhaps boredom, a little arrogance and a feeling of \\"just because he could\\", he pursued Carrie, the circumstances of which led to his ruination. His business endeavours sour, and he is too proud to seek positions below those to which he had become accustomed. Dreiser writes very movingly about Hurstwood's declining financial status and the shifting sandbars on which he maroons himself. He becomes a morose, inert, and powerless individual, when there once was power. He is cast off by the type of people over whom he had previously had power. Surviving New York on 15 cents a day, even in 1900, must have been near impossible. In the end, for Hurstwood, it was. His indolence and pride destroyed him as a man.Carrie, in the meantime, achieves the kind of success that seemed fantastical when she had been but a poor shopgirl struggling for $4.50 a week in Chicago. She is ultimately dissatisfied with her new-found wealth and celebrity. She knows that her work is easy and her success not achieved by hard work or years of labour; her failure in both relationships (albeit with men a good deal older than herself) has made her guarded and lonely. She keeps longing for that which is \\"ideal\\" but which is just out of her grasp. She is always something of an outsider, elusive and therefore desirable to those around her.In the end, she is as tentative and alone as when the story began; as the author writes \\"In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you long, alone. In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\""},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Classic story of small town girl comes to the big city to make her fortune. Written in the same realistic style that Dreisser used in An American Tragedy, Sister Carrie offers more for the reader to digest.Carrie arrives in Chicago to stay with a sister and her family and quickly realizes that the city is not as galmorous and she had dreamed. Fortunately for Carrie she possesses characteristics that will help her-charm and beauty. She is immediately sought out by a fast talking salesman who takes Carrie in and introduces her to a glimpse of the good life. Through Charley Druitt, Carrie meets and becomes romantically involved with George Hurstwood, a successful yet married, businessman.George gives up all for Carrie and spirits her away from Chicago; eventually to New York where they settle.

I would have liked to read more about Carrie's family back home and Hurstwood's abandoned family.... This book was incredible......Dreiser is a GREAT GREAT writer, there were some lines that I reread 2-3 times because i was so touched by his writing... Read this book !"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I hate to reiterate a common point made by many reviewers but I feel it's necessary to say (once again!) that the middle of the book was some hard reading. It wasn't hard, vocabulary-wise, but because Dreiser went into *great* detail about Carrie and Hurstwood, separately and as a couple (among many other things) - so much so that it could have been its own novel. It has the potential to lose people who are short on patience. Perhaps five chapters could have been combined into two (if that!).Be that as it may, roughing it through the middle makes getting to the end feel as if you've accomplished the impossible, and your effort will be rewarded.The ending was unconventional, to say the least. Not to give it away but if a potential reader believes that Dreiser tied things up quite nicely, think again! Such an ending is a present-day writing teacher's nightmare.I must confess that as I was reading the book I was simultaneously checking out the reviews here on Amazon and was prepared to feel really sorry for Hurstwood. From what I understand, Hurstwood's deterioration is the main attraction of the book (and of the movie adaptation made in the 1950s). After seeing how he tricked Carrie into leaving Chicago with him - first going to Canada and then settling in New York, how he was a bigamist (throwing that in Carrie's face at the appropriate moment), and how utterly unprepared he was to fight his wife and live a new life in a new town, I wound up not feeling as sorry for Hurstwood as is expected to be. His lack of motivation and the lies on which he built his life with Carrie were of his own doing and, in a sense, he got what he deserved in the end.Carrie, on the other hand, has been portrayed as this vixen who gladly used married men for her own gain and nothing could be farther from the truth. She didn't even know Hurstwood was married until Drouet sprang that bit of trivia upon her (after he was informed by a maid of Carrie's frequent outings with Hurstwood). Also, Drouet was not married (but they did live together as an unmarried couple in a day when that was unthinkable!).To me, Carrie is the most identifiable character here, not because she's the title character but because of her need to overcome a repetitive life full of drudgery, routine, and never making her ends meet. This was summed up perfectly on Page 31 of this edition: \\"Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play, how was her coming to the city to profit (her sister and her husband)?\\"Carrie's attitude regarding work and her outlook on life is, on the surface, very frivolous and not at all of an adult: \\"Carrie ... bent over her work. She felt as though she could hardly endure such a life. Her idea of work had been so entirely different\\" (Page 38). She wanted more out of life than what the industrial 1890s had to offer, and anyone can identify with that sentiment (especially today in the hyper 21st Century. What are supposed to be 9-5 office jobs turn out to be something we practically live with 24/7 and then you're fired (or \\"laid off\\"), without warning, for reasons that wouldn't make sense to a preschooler. And, for our troubles, we die of cancer in the end. Translation: Nothing much has changed in one hundred-plus years in this country).Carrie had advantages (like men wanting to take care of her) that others don't have (nor ever get) but, when the going got tough in New York City, she put her feet to the pavement and found work (something Hurstwood was always putting off).Whether one feels Carrie deserved her fame courtesy of hard work or through sheer luck (of being at the right place at the right time), Ames's thought sums up the reason for her success: \\"The world is always struggling to express itself ... Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings. They depend upon others. That is what genius is for. One man expresses their desires for them in music; another one in poetry; another one in a play. Sometimes nature does it in a face - it makes the face representative of all desire. That's what has happened in your case\\" (Page 429).Did the good guy/gal win here? That's up for debate. One thing is for sure is that \\"Sister Carrie\\" is definitely not your conventional tale and is a fine representation of good American literature.One final note: It's worth checking out the scholarship at the beginning of Barnes and Noble Classics Editions (as well as other editions that offer the same). While I find the overall scholarship to be biased majority of the time, it is, nonetheless, helpful and aids in your reading of the text. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This novel is a highly entertaining, soap-operatic critique of all that was wrong with the Industrial Revolution. Climb onboard for an emotional trainwreck through the bowels of the urban frontier. Imagine Henry James as a Marxist with a keen eye for fashion, high on caffeine and getting paid by the word, and you'll get a fairly accurate impression of this book. Though Carrie is naive, materialistic, and misguided, she is also compassionate, determined, and ultimately likeable. By making us care about his anchorless shopaholic waif, Dreiser sets us up for a delightfully bumpy ride. The slightly sagging middle chapters are small penance for the many bracing rewards."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Dreiser, an American novelist of the \\"naturalist school\\" published this, his first novel, in 1900, to limited acclaim. The wife of the publisher, Mrs. Doubleday, was adamantly opposed to its publication since, in her opinion, \\"immorality,\\" by which she means, Carrie's relationship with men, was not clearly punished. At the end of my \\"Barnes & Noble Classics\\" copy, there is a spot-on retort from a review in the \\"San Francisco Argonaut\\": \\"But these critics will have little to say in condemnation of the immorality of a commercial system which offers young girls a wage of three or four dollars a week in payment for labor as destructive to the mind as to the body.\\" As with numerous other American novelists, their merit was first recognized in Europe, and then reflected back to the States. The novel was re-issued in 1907, to a much more receptive public. Dreiser grew up in Indiana, and went to Chicago as a newspaperman. The principal character, Carrie, is based on his sister, who, in the novel, went from Wisconsin to Chicago. Though re-issued in the same year that Upton Sinclair published his famous muck-raking novelThe Jungle, also set in Chicago, Dreiser's novel is actually set in the 1880's - \`90's. In terms of the social classes, the two novels both complement and contrast the classes depicted, and there is a dash of some social mobility thrown in.Carrie is a classic country girl, fleeing a big family, for the lights of the big city. On the train to Chicago she meets Drouet, a smooth-talking salesman. Carrie's domestic situation, living with her sister and brother-in-law is not a happy one, and she soon takes up \\"domestic arrangements\\" with Drouet. And in the much more sedate time of what was the Victorian era in England, that is all you learn: the panting, puffing and groping are all carefully excised. Hurstwood, a married man of some property, and limited propriety, and an erstwhile friend of Drouet, also takes an unseeming interest in Carrie, which borders on Maugham'sOf Human Bondage. With this essential dynamic, the novel is propelled forward, with the inevitable vicissitudes in the human interactions as well as the social standing of the main characters. Roughly half the novel is set in New York City, so the reader gains an appreciation of the two largest American cities in the post-Civil War period, an event that is never mentioned.\\"Naturalism\\" means a realistic account life in the aforementioned cities. No \\"stream of consciousness\\" or other innovative story-telling techniques. Just a straightforward story, an easy read. I felt that the characterizations of the men, both Drouet and Hurstwood, seemed to be more insightful. Carrie is depicted as a strong women, with an independent streak, but she is also simply swept along by events, and her motivation at times is difficult to understand. The economics of the times is also realistically portrayed, including the grinding poverty that was the fate of most. Unemployment, underemployment, many of the same themes that dominant today's economy were highly operative then. Carrie \\"made it,\\" at least in terms of achieving success as an actress, but as Dreiser said, in terms of her relationship to Hurstwood: \\"She forgot her youth and her beauty. The handicap of age she did not, in her enthusiasm, perceive.\\" She achieved \\"success,\\" but not happiness. But that was not enough for Mrs. Doubleday, even though Dreiser says: \\"It is but natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her, its ambassadors should be discredited...In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\"Regrettably, this is the first novel of Dreiser's that I have read. His other major work, published a quarter century later,An American Tragedyis now on the \\"to-read list.\\" In terms of the characters, and the setting, it is an important American novel, relevant both then, and in our own troubled economic times. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Carrie Meeber leaves her small-town home in Wisconsin to try to make a life in Chicago. After unsuccessfully searching for steady employment, she gives up and becomes the \\"kept woman\\" of a male acquaintance, Charles Drouet. She finds her life with Drouet satisfactory for a while, but when she meets his friend George Hurstwood, a wealthier and more sophisticated gentleman, she begins a secret love affair with this older, married man.I'm a big fan of the naturalist novel, and Dreiser is renowned as one of the best American practitioners of this literary style. Even so, I was disappointed with this book. Though Dreiser, like an exemplary naturalist, brilliantly captures the naked reality of social conditions and human behavior, that alone doesn't make a great novel. A great novel requires characters that the reader actually cares about, and that's what I felt was lacking from this book. It's unfortunate that Dreiser chose a female protagonist, because he doesn't display a whole lot of insight into the feminine mind. Based on this book alone, one would think his conception of womankind could be summed up in the phrase, \\"They like shiny things.\\" Carrie comes across as shallow and stupid from chapter one. She continually makes life-changing decisions based on her desire for fancier clothing. In the second half of the book we gain more respect for her as she shows some competence in her chosen vocation, but it's too little too late, and her basic nature doesn't change. Hurstwood is a far more sympathetic character, but he exhibits his own frustrating assortment of unforgivable faults.The best portions of the book succeed in spite of the characters and plot, rather than because of them. The expository comments Dreiser makes on human nature are far more insightful than anything being acted out by the book's cast. The more documentary portions of the book are brilliantly drawn, for example an account of a transit workers' strike, or the portrayal of the plight of the homeless. Unfortunately it's difficult to feel much pathos for the one poor character in the book because his fall from riches to rags is brought about by extraordinarily bad decisions. Instead of a \\"this could happen to anyone\\" feeling toward poverty, the tragic downfall of the character leaves the reader with the attitude of \\"that would never happen to me\\" and \\"serves him right.\\"Sister Carrie is to be commended for its groundbreaking lack of sentimentality and its disregard for the puritanical morality of its day. Its liberating influence on American literature is unquestionable. Enough moments of brilliance shine through this flawed book to show me that Dreiser did have the great American novel within him, and I'm going to keep reading his work until I find it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The theme of Sister Carrie is searching for the &quot;American Dream.&quot; Carrie Meeber is searching for happiness by aquiring wealth and material possessions. The author, Theodore Dreiser, does an excellent job of keeping your attention with the use of his extremely descriptive language. He takes charecters from different classes of the American economy, and shows how they are corrupted by the pursuit of the American Dream. Sister Carrie gets off to a slow start, but the reader is able to connect with the events that unfold. Dreiser's talent lies in the fact that he was able to describe life as he saw it, tragic. Overall, the themes and symbolizism of Sister Carrie teach us that life is filled with success and failure."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"What more could you want in a turn of the century fiction?

Try this delight!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I am so glad that this book is on the list of the top 100 fictions, without the attention given, people would forget about this fantastic creation. The maturity of Dreiser's writing isn't very apparent here, which later on develops in An American Tragedy.A whistful romance, a tragic ending, with fantastic writing to go with it.Another book that's just as fabulous (and somewhat ignored) is A Room With a View by E.M. Forster. Both are lovely."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is a marvelous story. Dreiser has created a fascinating heroine. She, like Zola's Nana, makes her living off of other people. However, Carrie is a sympathetic character where Nana is not. Carrie brings down the men with whom she consorts in much the same way as Nana. Both girls are actresses, though Carrie has true talent while Nana makes it on the thrust of her hip. Carrie has only a few more virtues and redeeming qualities than did Nana, but I at least was just as overjoyed at Carrie's success in the theatre as I was satisfied at Nana's revolting end. This is a sign of how well written Sister Carrie is. Dreiser has taken a potentially weak or even vile (with different writing) character, and made her into quite the heroine! A wonderful read-I sat down one night and finished it at three in the morning-I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Carrie never really overcame her bad characteristics, and she did ruin a few lives, but her ending was perfect. I think somehting should have been done to make up for that, but that's strictly personal opinion. It's still five stars despite that!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I would have hated being the fallen man who ran away from his life to live and flirt with a flirt.

Oh well, I need to get some sleep now after this heavy read."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"A twisted novel with the usual great writing Theodore Dreiser presents. I found this book quite simple in text, but emotionally difficult to grasp the idea of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;affairs&quot;. The typical Daniel Steel fan just might like to try this turn-of-the-century novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I must admit I've never read Sister Carrie, but it is a free Kindle book and I thought I had nothing to lose. I must say the editing done on this book is terrible. Words are missing or the wrong word appears in a sentence. It makes it difficult to understand the whole sentence. I've even seen the same sentence repeated on the same page. I really would enjoy this e-book much, much more, if it didn't appear to have been hastily thrown together. I've not have this problem with Kindle books I have purchased."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I think that the subject matters of this book definitely have a special place in the American literature. The attractions and risks of the vibrant, everchanging society and confusions over the shifting values and the desire to maintain the appearance of the old morals, and one's life can change any minute by luck, misfortune, or choices resulted from impulsivity or lazy complacency etc. I gave only 3 stars because of the lack of personalities in main characters, they seem rather flat to me, not generating much emotions, neither compassion, or disgust. However, perhaps this also may be was the author's intention to depict how ind's volitions and personalities are inconsequential to the more powerful forces of the circumstances of that time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sometimes you are told to read a book because it is a classic and then it turns out to be really awful. 'Sister Carrie' is a classic, written in 1900. And it still is...it is the great story of Carrie, a Midwestern girl who moves to Chicago, moves in with a man, gets stolen in a way by someone else and moves to New York. It is a story about wealth and poverty and many opposites. She makes her own life, starts out poor and living with her sister to becoming a succesful Broadway star while her husband in NY ends poor and eventually commits suicide.I didn't like it as much as 'An American Tragedy' but it is still very good."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I found this novel very intriguing and moving. The symbols and representations are very analytical. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; causes one to think twice about oneself, and to reconsider one's own definition of true happiness and success. It shows one how society can influence one to think in the manner in which one does. The characters face good times and bad times and experience true tests of strength and survival. The results are both well developed and interesting to discover. It is difficult to put the book down. When reading this novel one must understand the sybolism and look deep into the context to acquire the meanings of it. Another interesting fact about this novel is that Theodore Dreiser actually wrote the novel in the year 1900. I am a junior in high school and I strongly recomend the reading of this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I don't think I got all the way through Sister Carrie, but I do recall thinking that Carrie is an amorphous idiot with no real voice of her own and no opinions. She is completely inexpressive, hence we never really get to know her -- to understand her motivations. Perhaps this is Dreiser's intention -- indeed, Carrie's lack of strength is likely the main reason for her downfall. I wouldn't know -- her character was so aggravating, with her wishy-washy, inarticulate ways, that the book did not make a truly lasting impression on me. Not bad, though, if you have more patience and more time than I did."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"There are many well-deserved reasons as to why this novel is a classic, all of which have been discussed by other reviewers. However, if you tend to find most classics to be something \\"better to have read than to actually read\\", be aware that Sister Carrie really might bore you to tears. Dreiser's awful, heavy-handed writing style is legendary, the novel is at least twice as long as it honestly needs to be, the characters are all cliched stock figures whose passivity makes them even more tedious, and the subject matter, which had been so shocking at the time, has long since lost all impact.Well, get over it. The real impact of the novel today is in the myriad little fascinating details of interest to anyone even remotely curious about daily life during the gaslight era of American history. Plus, of course, the realism. This had always been the point, but the fact that Carrie is based on Dreiser's real-life sister certainly adds a dimension. And while the story of Carrie Meeber's/Emma Dreiser's life would hardly be as scandalous today, the underlying emotions, ambitions and consequences are just as timelessly relevant."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This book is boring and dull.

When it arrived, it turned out to be almost twice as wide as a normal paperback book. The downside is that it is not very portable. I like to read while on a bus or train. Having this book open is like reading a textbook, not very practical in many situations in which I like to read.So, before you buy, be sure you know the dimensions of the book. The one I received is about 8 inches wide, 10 inches high and about .7 inches thick."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" is historically monumental, culturally meaningful, and a sloggy read from first page to last.It tells the story of Carrie Meeber, a Wisconsin farm girl who comes to Chicago in 1889 to find her way. After a brief, unhappy stay with her cheerless sister, she lights upon a drummer named Drouet happy to show Carrie a better life in exchange for her becoming his unmarried lover. The result is a happy one for Carrie, but two things threaten her ersatz domesticity: the possibility of a career on the stage, and the attentions of a philandering resort manager named Hurstwood.\\"Why, I should think that you would be very happy,\\" she tells Hurstwood at one point. \\"You know so much of the world.\\"\\"That is it,\\" he answers. \\"I know too much of the world.\\"First published (and famously suppressed) in 1900, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was infamous not only for the sordidness of Carrie's circumstances, but the utterly naturalistic approach Dreiser took to describing them. Like Darwin with a fossil bone, Dreiser finds broader implications for his minute observations on the lifestyle of Carrie and her friends, implications he often expounds upon at length.\\"It was not for her to see the wellspring of human passion,\\" he writes. \\"A real flame of love is a subtle thing. It burns as a will-o'-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds.\\"Dreiser's point-of-view is rooted enough in reality to command respect, but the thin plot is a detriment as are the uninvolving characters at the center. Carrie is a strangely dull flower who is seen forever staring out at windows, content to float along on the tides of others' passions with only her beauty to save her. She generates no sympathy. Nor do Drouet and Hurstwood, the latter of whom seems especially ill-presented as a relentless go-getter one minute and lazy lounger the next. The then-29-year-old Dreiser presents this as the matter-of-fact result of turning 43.Positives of \\"Sister Carrie\\" include a Chicago so real you can smell the stockyards and the flophouse drunks, a treatment of Carrie's stage career that provides necessary diversion from the main storyline, and some mildly amusing glimpses at Hurstwood's loveless marriage. \\"Sister Carrie\\" lacks for humor generally, which along with the robotic characters make the book a dull read despite the fact it is written in a plain and accessible style, unlike Dreiser's later \\"An American Tragedy.\\"I really enjoyed \\"American Tragedy;\\" which benefitted from a masterfully-spun plot and engaging people. If the idea of someone actually benefitting from sex before marriage wasn't so objectionable at the time, I doubt \\"Sister Carrie\\" would enjoy the cultural standing it does today.

Words are also omitted. It's just a mess, and I quit in disgust after two or three pages--tiny pages on an iPod Touch! Don't bother."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Dreiser's &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is a complex novel of linear events. It is a study in cause and effect -- how a character's environment, or change of environment, affects his or her values, especially with regard to money and the iniquity it brings.18-year-old Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Meeber, bored with her life in a small Wisconsin town, comes to Chicago in 1889 to live with her sister Minnie. The only employment she can get is a laborious, low-paying job in a shoe factory, and when she loses it and wears out her welcome with her sister's family, a well-to-do young man named Charles Drouet, whom she met on the train to Chicago, sets her up in an apartment where they pretend to be married.Drouet has a friend named George Hurstwood, a man in his late thirties and the manager at a local upscale bar. Hurstwood's home life is stagnant and empty; he has a self-centered wife whom he ceased loving long ago and two materialistic children around Carrie's age. He is going through what many decades later would be called a midlife crisis.Through Drouet, Hurstwood meets Carrie and they form a mutual attraction. Unlike Drouet, to whom life is all about social status, Hurstwood does not patronize Carrie; he makes her feel intelligent and important, and Carrie exhibits Hurstwood's ideals of youth and beauty. When Hurstwood's wife gets wise to her husband's affair and sues him for divorce, Hurstwood succumbs to the temptation to steal money from his employer and tricks Carrie into leaving Chicago with him. They go to New York and experience curious reversals of fortune -- Carrie becomes a rich and famous showgirl while Hurstwood drifts into inescapable poverty and a bitter end.This is no Cinderella story for Carrie. It may seem like she is being rewarded for her innocence and integrity, but since she realizes that her success is more the result of luck than talent, her new life is not as fulfilling as she thought it might be. I found myself surprisingly engaged by the story because Dreiser presents his characters as real people with unsolvable problems and doesn't try to teach a morality lesson. I finished the novel feeling miserable about the world, which is not something that many novels can do to me. My only complaint is that Dreiser's prose is a little awkward and excessively wordy without the benefit of clarity; it longs for the smoother touch of D.H. Lawrence or Somerset Maugham."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Dreiser describes the psyche and actions of Carrie Meeber, a young woman trying to succeed in the late nineteenth century in America, and others she meets to show the struggle of young women trying to succeed in the newly industrialized America. When Dreiser first published Sister Carrie, his publisher censored the book due to its shocking content. Dreiser unfortunately has a tendency to ramble about some topics. Although Dreiser uses lengthy descriptions at times, he still manages to get across the horrible injustices that befell many Americans during this time. The book seems to revolve around chance. Although Dreiser shows the inevitability in the characters' lives and that everything led to death, he also shows that much of the events occurred by chance. The characters meet each other by chance, and the events that lead to Carrie's downfall happened by chance. Dreiser shows the world he lived in to the reader. Everything in the book is not random chance. It accurately displays life at that time in America. Dreiser took his story from Horatio Alger. Alger told of virtuous and ambitious men, however. Dreiser took a woman and allowed her to succeed. This added to the shock value of the novel. Another novel of shock value during this industrialization period is The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. This novel showed the horrors of the meat-packing industry. Sister Carrie spent some time exploiting sweat shops although that was not the primary focus of the novel. However, if one likes Sister Carrie, The Jungle would be a good book to read to learn more of the lives of the working class during the industrialization period in American history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Achieving happiness through worldly goods is a mistake that is often made in society today. In his novel, Sister Carrie, Theodore Dreiser explores this situation. Dreiser uses many different symbols, themes, and contrasts to teach the moral lesson that happiness lies not in worldly goods, especially when achieved by immoral means. Drieser beautifully states the cycle of Carrie's emotions, which involve first Carrie's aspirations, then her achievement, and then her unhappiness, which makes her aspire to do more. This cycle repeats throughout the novel, and through this cycle Carrie systematically climbs up the social ladder. Therefore, Carrie is the embodiment of the &quot;American Dream&quot; of rags-to-riches which was prevalent in the late 1800's. Dreiser also explores the idea that too much of a longing for something leads to disaster, but desire for the unknown or for improvement is hope, innocence or even a form of redemption. This contrast is shown later in the novel between Carrie and Hurstwood. Dreiser's main point in the novel is a contrast between material goods and true happiness or fulfilment. Because of Dreiser's beautifully created characters, the book has a sense of true reality due to the characteristics of each person in the novel. Carrie is susceptible to bribes, while Hurstwood is the typical working-class husband. Dreiser recounts the contrast of Hurstwood's decline into utter poverty and Carrie's rise to stardom, which becomes a central irony of the book. These two characters, along with all of the rest, are very easy to relate to and help to create a more powerful story. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of the past and of the struggle of women to find their place in society. This is without a doubt one of my favorite novels. The powerful reality and moral lesson of the story made a lasting impact."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This book was a lesson in the journey from poor to rich and how even though moving up the ladder of success, Sister Carrie never achieved the peace and happiness she thought success and money would bring.

It more or less teaches a very important life lesson."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The story shocked the turn-of-the century folks because of the sensitive themes it.tackled.

The year is 1889. \\"She was eighteen years of age, bright, timid and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth.\\"Carrie is soon overwhelmed by the difficulty of finding work, especially since she has no previous experience as a wage earner. When she finally does get a job on an assembly line at a shoe factory for $3.50 per week, she is exhausted by long hours of standing and poor working conditions. \\"Not the slightest provision had been made for the comfort of the employees, the idea being that something was gained by giving them as little as possible.\\" \\"The wash rooms and lavatories were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the whole atmosphere was one of hard contract.\\"Carrie does well in spite of these hardships, but she must pay her sister's husband almost her entire salary for her room and board. With winter coming and the chill winds of a Chicago autumn upon her, Carrie has no money for a coat, hat, nor even an umbrella. She is absolutely wretched. Then she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, whom she had become slightly acquainted with on the train to the city. She is eventually tricked into living with him - seduced by his offers of marriage, and the economic security and comparative independence he provides her. She is still a girl and is motivated by impulses and her passive, overly trusting nature.Carrie makes another serious mistake when she allows herself to be deceived a second time by a well-to-do, married saloon manager twice her age, Mr. Hurstwood. Drouet, showing off, had introduced Carrie to his socially superior friend, and also thought to shine in Hurstwood's eyes by presenting him to his attractive, young \\"wife.\\"Disillusioned after a few years with Drouet, who loves her in his fashion but has proved to be irresponsible and flighty, Carrie believes Hurstwood to be single and herself to be in love with him. Hurstwood, a respectable gentleman who has never been a philanderer, is himself quite enamored with Carrie - enough to leave his family. He persuades her to flee Chicago and move with him to New York. He does this by outright lying to the young woman in his desperation to have her.Given the period when the novel was published and the morality and mores of the time, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not only poorly received, the novel scandalized polite society. The heroine, a young woman who comes to the city, forms two out-of-wedlock relationships, eventually becomes successful in her own right, rising to fame and respectability. She is rewarded rather than punished for her moral lapses.Originally a newspaperman, Theodore Dreiser writes with a blunt journalistic style. In \\"Sister Carrie\\" and his other work, he deals with the gritty reality of life and is known as an outstanding representative of naturalism - a movement in literature and the arts where real life subjects are portrayed as they exist in the real world - with all their blemishes and defects.I originally read \\"Sister Carrie\\" 25 years ago and thought to revisit it when I found it in one of my book trunks. I loved the novel back then, but now I really appreciate what a great American novel this is. The characters are outstanding in their depth and realism. The story is compelling, and the portrait of American life as seen through Dreiser's eyes is exceptional. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is probably best known for being the American example of the Naturalist school of writing. Centering around Carrie, a girl who comes to Chicago to live the good life in the big city, it follows her action from being a factory worker, to a 'companion', to a housewife, and finally to fame and fortune on the stage in New York City.Dreiser sets the measure of the game early, on the first page, with the statement that all women are provided two options in life. One is to work hard, live, and have children. The other is to fall into a life of sin.For those who don't hold with that line of reasoning, the book will be a bit hard to swallow. Dreiser operates along the same line of logic that Emile Zola set down when creating this genre. Every action Carrie makes is predestined, in Dreiser's eyes, by her surroundings. She will not and cannot make any decision contrary to her 'nature'.While this is all very well and good for Dreiser, it is not so for Naturalism. Thomas Hardy's famous Tess, and Jude, make decisions contrary to their nature all the time, it is society that is at odds with the characters and not the other way around. Carrie's society seems perfectly willing to accept her, but it is her decisions that one finds appalling. The feeling is more like being on a careening freight train, with the outcome inevitable and predestined but terrible nonetheless. There is none of the same despair and void that one finds in Hardy, and somehow that is the books biggest flaw.Hardy's novels, that were written a full forty years before Sister Carrie, explore naturalism in such a way as to make the character the hero and society the villain. Dreiser's Carrie is no such hero, she is just the unfortunate victim of circumstance."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Maybe I'm just not as unforgiving as the other reviewers, but I found this edition to read just fine. Yes, there were a few errors, but not nearly as many as the other reviewers claimed. Aside from that, it's a great piece of literature from that era. It is a story of life in the factories of late 19th century Chicago, a story of an \\"immoral\\" girl being taken care of by men to escape the factory life, and the misery she caused them. Evidently, this book was considered scandalous in its day, as Carrie never suffers any consequences for her immorality. A good read."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"A girl named Carrie moves from Wisconsin to Chicago to become something. She gets in a love triangle with two men--the kind, but \\"inferior\\" Charles Drouet and the worldly, wealthy George Hurstwood. Carrie picks one of the two, and we see a reverse of good fortune. Carrie rises in society while her significant other, through a series of bad decisions, falls in society. Carrie uses these men to get what she wants, but I wouldn't exactly call her a maneater. Through failure and success and exposure to harsh reality, Carrie matures and toughens. She grows; though some may argue she becomes a worse person, not a better one.This was Theodore Dreiser's first novel. It is a very good story and a very easy read.Sister Carrie also delves into the cutthroat conditions of the late 1890's. The ease at which someone became homeless and was at the mercy of other people's compassion was very scary. This book made me deathly afraid of becoming homeless. I can't tell you how paranoid I was. Some people seem to think everyone who is homeless asked for it by being lazy or indulging in bad habits. But if we realized how quickly good fortune could change, maybe we could be a little more sensitive and sympathetic to people who find themselves on the street. It could easily be us: even those of us who aren't stupid or frivolous with our money."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie, by Theodore Dreiser, is, in short, the tale of a small-town country girl's attempts to rise to aristocracy in the cutthroat world of the early 20th century. After many adventures, and some trials and tribulations, Carrie does find the affluence and financial success that she desired more than anything else in the world - but there is more to it than that.Carrie from the beginning seems to be the very emblem of a consumer driven materialistic society, and there seems to be no doubt about this as the book continues on. She seems possessed by the inanimate, and seems to completely disregard anything other than the right clothes, the right place to work, and her appearance. Carrie is seemingly vapid, and, as she struggles to \\"make it\\" by letting Drouet take care of her and give her his money, she hardly acknowledges the fact that he has helped pull her out of poverty. Once she is able, she throws him away in order to be with Hurstwood, a man of even more wealth and connection. However, it needs to be said that Carrie is not stupid. As materialistic and shallow as she seems to be, she is intriguing nonetheless. She knows how to get what she wants, how to manipulate others into giving her what she wants, and there is something about her that even the men of the novel seem to find irresistible. She is most definitely worth a deeper analysis.The fact remains, however, that none of the characters seem likeable. They all lack depth, don't seem to have agency, and remain basically static throughout the entirety of the novel. But this is brilliance on Dreiser's part, because it seems to serve as a commentary of the society in which the characters are a part. They seem to perfectly represent a world which also seems to lack in depth and focuses solely on exterior, surface-level qualities.Dreiser's novel is a powerful and accurate portrayal of a materialistic society and the ways in which living such a shallow life can ultimately lead to the downward spiral and complete end of a person, like Hurstwood, or the forever unfulfilled and never-quite-satisfied attitude of Carrie's. But Beware: the prose tends to positively drag in many places, mostly through the middle section of the book, moving at an almost ridiculously slow pace. Nonetheless, it is still worth the time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This equisite novel quickly worked its way onto my favorite books of all time list, ranking among Anna Karenina. Hurstwood's character reminded me much of a male version of Anna, and I believe Dreiser did an EXCELLENT job at writing his demise. The novel drips irony off every page. Hurstwood and Carrie have more or less switched social positions by the end of the novel. In order to understand the full value of the novel, and why it is so daring and ahead of its time, the reader MUST remove himself from today's time period. I compare this novel to Anna Karenina because much like Tolstoy wrote of Anna's demise in society, Dreiser writes of Hurstwood's demise in society: the new industrial America. On the other hand, Carrie was achieving unspeakable status all on her own. This was unheard of by a woman at the turn of the century.The second half of the novel Dreiser develops the theme of chance, and how it led Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet to where they are in life. Unfortunately, he does not ever return to Carrie's sister. I would have liked to learn a little more about her and her family as well as where times took them.Dreiser also explores Carrie's fascination with materialism. Probably one of my favorite parts of the novel was when Carrie realized money wouldn't buy her happiness. Here Dreiser reflects Camus' ideas of happiness versus reality. No matter what she bought, it was never enough, and Carrie was never able to achieve the happiness she dreamed of. &quot;In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.&quot;All in all, this book is an excellent read. Anyone wishing to find a book to fall in love with-- the characters, the setting, plot, etc.-- this book is a must. It is an easy and quick read filled with much more than what merely appears on the surface. Sister Carrie is a story of love, deceit, greed, violence, and much more. Definitely read it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I readAn American Tragedymany years ago. I do not remember very much about it. I remember that it moved me, but that I forgot it quickly. Sister Carrie is my second book by Dreiser.I was dreading the book, at least a little bit. It seems to be universally damned with faint praise. I have heard readers describe the prose as awkward and overblown. I remember a Salon column snarking about it some years ago. I have heard that Dreiser's prose improved with the other novels, and have been told that it was possible to skip Carrie. And so on.I loved it. That's a little bit lacking in nuance-- there *were* places that I got the criticism. At times I might have wished for other pacing. It has little flaws in the execution, and I suspect that you have to be able to swallow Dreiser's overall style. He's not lithe and little and zippy. His writing is sort of like a hoop skirt-- elegant from some angles, ponderous from others, not really very practical all around.This said, I have rarely read a novel that treats so very well with character in time and place. Caroline Meeber is the kind of woman I find utterly unsympathetic. Her literary heirs generally fill me with irritation and vague revulsion, no matter how sympathetically portrayed. You know what I mean-- the lovely young animal, the woman who wants but doesn't think, the actress. Dreiser does a remarkable thing. He doesn't really make her sympathetic, exactly, but he makes her understandable. He makes a type of person who rarely seems human very human indeed. And a product of her time. The book is as much about the fragility of success in the early industrial era as it is about the individuals involved. Carrie comes through the mill unhappy but unscathed. George Hurstwood breaks himself in the traps of the time, forgetting that by serving the wealthy he does not actually become invincible. Terrible and true.I believe that the strength with character in the text outweighs any flaws in the prose style. Perhaps I will be less impressed with a later reading, but right now, I would recommend it.(Sister Carrie has an odd publishing background, by the way. There are several published versions of the book. I read the Penguin Classics unexpurgated version, and it seems to make a real difference if you get the earlier published versions which Dreiser self-censored in order to get the book printed. If in doubt, take a quick look--not enough to spoil your ending!-- at the last few pages. If it ends with Carrie, you've got a bowdlerized edition. If it ends with Hurstwood, you've got one of the unexpurgated or repaired editions. I found the foreword of my edition by Alfred Kazin helpful in understanding the publishing history.)"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"hello all, my review for this book is based entirely on the quality of this text, not on the novel/story. Sister Carrie is a masterpiece and should be read by all, but this particular text is horrendous. The words \\"though\\" and \\"thoughT\\" are used interchangeably, words are left out of sentences, periods are placed randomly in the middle of sentences, and there are even instances where sections are repeated (i.e. six lines are followed by the exact six lines).If you want to enjoy the Sister Carrie that Dresier wrote, do not buy this edition! You will be disappointed. Please order a text from a different publisher."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"\\"Increase of material comforts, it may be generally laid down, does not in any way whatsoever conduce to moral growth.\\" Mahatma Gandhi\\"She (Carrie Meeber) wanted pleasure, she wanted position, and yet she was confused as to what these things might be.\\" p. 145 \\"Sister Carrie\\"Critics may scoff at the immorality of the main characters, the persistently subtle, yet always stinging slams at the evils of Capitalism, or how depressing the novel is. But despite it all, my interest never waned from the first page to the last. Yes, Dreiser's super-duper liberal (although liberal back in 1900 is a tad different than what we consider liberal today), but this man could sure write beautifully! At times, he's almost a poet, as I found myself reading some sentences and paragraphs two to three times over for their sublime brilliance.Dreiser's prose is both honest and brave. He develops his characters beautifully, at a slow, methodic pace, carefully unraveling the mysterious air of each of the three main characters until the very last pages. Yes, he's iconoclastic. Yes, he gets a bit too preachy toward the end of the novel. Yes, he's a bit dark and discouraging. Yes he's a bit too liberal for many folks. And yes, his bitter, but many times brilliant observations are a tad too cluttered with sarcasm and irony. Yet for me, I just couldn't put this one down, nor forget about it when I finally did.Carrie, Carrie, Carrie ... it is so easy for all of us to sit back and judge you. You slept your way to the top in many people's eyes. You sold your soul to become successful in our material world. Yet most people who have become successful in our society have led far worse lives than Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" and many of them are lionized. We have to ask ourselves, is it our jealous, judgmental nature that makes many of us go tisk-tisk about the lack of this gal's morals? My glass house is waaaay too thin to do this. Yet, I do not advocate in any way, shape or form using others to get what you want in life. The pursuit of materialism should never mean the sacrifice of one's ethics, morals and values. However, I do believe that Carrie was coming to this realization toward the end of the novel. In order to not disclose too much to those who haven't read this yet, I will say no more.As I stated above, this classic definitely isn't without its imperfections. If you are a staunch conservative, there's a good chance this writer will irk you a bit. I also thought Dreiser was a bit too harsh in regards to the fate of the book's male protagonist, perhaps punishing him for being the quintessential all-American, conservative Capitalist that he represented early on. He also is a writer who tends to be idealistic to a fault, getting way too preachy and sanctimonious for most of us mere, marred mortals to handle at times.Overall though, I really, really dug this classic novel. This is the first time I have read Dreiser, and I greatly admire his compelling, penetrative style. The story is well written, no real action, very little plot, mostly a character study of some very realistic people whom we all have known in life. The beauty of this simplistic story is the way it plays on just about every emotion imaginable, which made it for me, never a dull moment.I loved it. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it at least twenty times in the past sixteen years. I'll spare you the literary review, which I'm sure you can read anywhere, and tell you why it still holds interest for the modern reader.Theodore Dreiser's attention to detail was definitely one of his major strengths as a writer. I've always found the details of late 1800's Chicago and New York fascinating in this novel. If you are particularly interested in this time period, you may want to read this novel for the everyday historical details alone.The coming-of-age theme is also one that modern readers can relate to, even though Carrie is from a different time. She leaves behind her small town and her family at the age of eighteen and is dazzled by city life. We can all relate to the degradation and desperation she feels as she seeks out her first job, and her desire for independence. Ultimately, she is successful, at least in a material sense, and the journey the reader follows her on is engaging.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I would highly recommend Sister Carrie. I have read most of Dreiser's other novels and several of his short stories. This is by far the best of his works, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Drieser's unique and boldfaced novel of a country woman of beauty and her rise to fame in New York as a reknown broadway star."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The rise of a poor pretty female to a rich, famous and beloved actress.

It amazed me how a poor girl could slowly, with the right people and timing, could become a broadway star. And how a man, who runs away with the poor girl, once wealthy of prestige and money, would fall down low enough to go and beg for money from her. The scariest part of this book was how he chose to end his life, after bad mistakes and dreams. The total American life, taking its toll on the ones that haven't been able to handle success."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Dreiser, more than any other novelist of the first half of the twentieth century,captured the brutish, corrupting power of large American cities, particularly Chicago, and most notably in Sister Carrie, based on the personal experiences of his older sister. Dreiser, like Stephen Crane whose body of work preceded Carrie by only a few years,was repelled but strangely drawn to the underbelly of large, impersonal urban centers beckoning young writers from the hinterland. In the case of Stephen Crane who consorted with the demimonde of New York's Lower East Side, and may in fact harbored desires of becoming one of the lost souls he portrayed, Dreiser observes the city with the dispassionate and clinically detached eye of a surgeon. He is interested in the social forces that compel man; Hurstwood's fumbling, faint-hearted attempt to remove money from his employer's safe only to have the safe door slam shut at the moment he begins to reconsider the consequences of his actions, suggests that man is powerless before the &quot;larger forces&quot; of nature which is a persistent theme found in Dreiser's best work. Sister Carrie and American Tragedy are representative novels of ambition, lust, greed,and envy in all its corrupting excess. The final scenes of Hurstwood shambling through the darkened streets of Manhattan during a raging blizzard, are among the most powerful and thought provoking images to be found in all of literature. A tour de force from one of America's greatest novelists, albeit one of its most politically Quixotic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I liked the literature aspect of this book and the picutre it presented from that period of time in US.

You actually wind up rooting for Carrie, just because there is no one else to root for. The book is SO pompous and chauvenist, I could barely stand it. Every female in the story is either cold and materialistic, or young, materialistic and stupid. I haven't encountered such blatant sexism in a &quot;classic&quot; since Howell's &quot;Editha.&quot; I will say, though, that Dreiser's actual writing talent is incredible, he has a mystical and dark way with words; too bad he had to waste it on this. My life actually would have been better without reading this."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Theodore Dreiser is considered to be the leading American practitioner of Naturalism--which consists of writing about sex and violence in the lower classes in order to reveal what I gather were supposed to be shattering truths about the bleak aspects of modern industrial urban life. To that end, Sister Carrie tells the story of a pretty small town girl who uses her feminine wiles to sleep her way from the factories and saloons of Chicago to the New York stage. Along the way, the tavern owning married man who stole to fund their escape to Chicago, kills himself after being abandoned by Carrie and ending up in Bowery flophouses. Meanwhile, An American Tragedy tells the story, based on a sensational true crime, of a young man who is working his way towards the American dream and refuses to let a pregnant former girlfriend stand in the way of his chance for romance with a wealthy woman. He takes the slattern out in a boat &amp; clobbers her, but is tried and executed for the crime.It is an open secret that even critics who admire Dreiser, consider him to be a horrible writer technically. American Tragedy has been called &quot;the worst-written great novel in the world&quot; and the otherwise loathsome Garrison Keillor has an amusing column about how bad he finds Sister Carrie on rereading it. His books have all the literary grace of the phone book.Thus, his reputation rests solely on the agreement of Left wing critics with his hatred of American capitalism. Well, 100 years on, I think we can safely say that the American system has served us pretty well and the Sister Carrie's of the world are not simply insignificant but, worse for a writer, uninteresting.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"THIS IS POSITIVELY ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ - AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE READ IT IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.

There can be no veiled gesture, no muted note, no conversational tone, in either discussion of the work in consideration, or in the work itself. Americans, eternal children that they are, in a cultural sense, will only be satisfied by the very biggest big-top, the grandstanding-est grandstand, the three-ringiest of three ring affairs. At this point, whatever P.T. Barnum quote springs to mind first may be mentally inserted by you, dear reader.Seen through such eyes -- that is, the wide-eyed ones of the American Child -- something like \\"Sister Carrie\\" may very well be \\"The Great American Novel.\\" For certainly, no one has ever painted the themes of MONEY, SEX, and CLASS, with a broader brush, or heavier strokes. Flannery O'Connor says that when Henry James received a manuscript that he did not like, he would return it to the sender with the remark, \\"You have chosen a good subject and are treating it in a straightforward manner.\\" The poor dolt on the receiving end of such a critique would go away thinking that his effort had been praised, unaware that the good subject is never properly disposed of in a straightforward manner. James's remark is particularly apropos of Dreiser's manner, which is straightforward in the way that a charging bull is so. Along the way, he shatters all of the china in the shop, crunching the medium-sized pieces into smaller ones under his massive heels. There is little or no art in his approach, and much of the book feels like \\"chaff\\".It particularly drags in those sections where he describes a single action by a character over the course of tens, or dozens, of pages. Two particularly egregious examples are Carrie's initial search for work, and then Hirstwood's subsequent search to the same end later in the book. Both of these episodes, although they are important to character development, could have had the same impact at about a third to a half of their unedited length. This same comment could be leveled at the work as a whole.In all, it is not surprising that Dreiser's reputation has shed much of the bloat that his novels never will."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I finished it last weekend, it is not that difficult to read word wise but after you read it you have to digest all they Dreiser is saying. He is sending many messages through the plot that I realized at the end, you could really discuss the book forever because (published in 1900) it deals with all of the many changes in society.Some think of Carrie as a heroine but I dont think so. I did not really like her throughout the book until the end because she is sort of punished in a way (dont want to spoil it). She really was not proactive and destoryed almost everyone in her path.I like how sometimes at the end of chapters and at the ednd of the tome Dreiser will generally speak about the message he is deliverering.IF YOU ARE VACILLATING on wether (sp?) to read this or not, question your motives and what type of lit you like. It was interesting becuase I haven't read much from this time period.

Yes, times were difficult for a single woman who had to go it alone; I will give that point. However, I don't see that as excuse to throw morality out the door, to use and be used by other people, and be constantly on the prowl for somebody better or more, prettier \\"things\\". I had a dislike of Carrie from early on. Dreiser repeatedly tries to portray her as a little country innocent when she was, in fact, a shallow, dull, weak-minded but evidently physically attractive woman. She uses her sister then dumps her; she uses her first \\"live in\\" boyfriend, then dumps him for a married man; she uses the married man but is on the lookout for another. She is always looking for happiness by latching on to someone else's money and finery. Wouldn't you know it, she manages to become a self-supporting actress after using everybody along the way. Oh, but she is innocent and naive the whole time--yeah right. Dreiser uses Carrie as a vehicle to attempt to show capitalism as being vulgar, selfish, and self-destructing. If Carrie were typical, he would have a point.The book is a little over-the-top, in my opinion. Carrie is just too pretty, too \\"innocent\\"; the men are incredibly stupid to be lead around by the nose by this creature.

Dreiser is a thorough enough author that reading this book through any lens brings new issues and view points to the surface.

He writes about life without the romantic heroism of Hemingway or the aristocratic ex-pat view of Fitzgerald.

There is nothing that I can give bad criticism in this story, except for the fact that some of the characters were disagreeable to me.

A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The pursuit of happiness may be the dominating adventure in the life of all men. For over three centuries, Americans have linked happiness with wealth and success. In Dreiser's Sister Carrie, Carrie is consistently seeking out this &quot;American Dream.&quot; Dreiser forces the reader to confront the question-- &quot;What will bring man fulfillment?&quot; This novel is devoted to pointing out that fulfillment does not come from material objects, but from honest labor. Sister Carrie follows the life of Carrie, in the last part of the 19th century, as she moves up from a small town girl to a Broadway star. Dreiser's simple style makes this book easy to understand. Due to Dreiser's lack of formal education, the language is a bit choppy. This lack of education, however, does not interfere with the power of this story. He reiterates his theme of materialism versus fulfillment with many metaphors. For example, he compares fortune to an organism--something that draws on the strength of outside sources. Dreiser's use of metaphors and his intense character developments makes this book enjoyable. It is a rags to riches story that does not lead to inner satisfaction. If you enjoy long books about women of the past, you must read this. It is not only valuable for its revelations of timeless truths, but also its history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is an epic story of destruction and dissatisfaction when a person's self is centered around possessions. Dreiser tells the story fo Carrie's rise from rags to riches beautifully by incorporating vivid similes and metephors that capture the wealth Carrie yearns for. The main theme throughout the novel is the pursuit of happiness and the endless dissatisfaction that occurs when you base your self on wealth and status. We follow Carrie as she dreams of a higher position, receives it, is not quite happy, dreams of an even higher position, receives it, and the cycle continues never finding Carrie content. Dreiser developes the characters so beautifully you feel you truly know them. Life is presented as it really is. Dreiser gives very detailed accounts of the setting and continually gives insightful comments on situations, society, and character motives to effectively pull in the reader. Another important theme running through the novel is one of creating society as a show or play. Everyone is an actor. This is really effective as Dreiser illustrates the fact that people become what they must in order to get what they want. However, this theme is presented in a setting where the city becomes symbolic for all the corruption that occurs when presented with luxury. I loved this book and could really identify with the characters. In the latter half of the novel, Dreiser's juxtapostion of one character's assent to fame and the another's decent into poverty was so moving I do not believe I will ever forget it. The idea that the pursuit of happiness through worldly goods will lead to endless dissatisfaction was very insightful and moving throughout the novel. I would suggest this book to anyone, especially to those would love to be swept away by a beautiful yet realistic tale of wealth and corruption."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This book was written at the turn of the century and it is a great portrait of American life and ideals at that time. It is the story of a young girl named Carrie who leaves her small town to go to Chicago to live with her sister and find work. She soon finds that living with her sister and her husband is very boring and that work is hard and dull. Soon she is a mistress of a pretty wealthy man, and the rest of the book is the story of her rise in society.One of the main themes of this book is materialism, and how people would do anything for money. During the book I could see how innocent Carrie becomes a victim of circumstances as she tries to fit into the environment around her and becomes swallowed by the anonymity of the city. I love Dreiser's style, although he goes off on unneccessary little lectures at times, and I really liked following the plot. The characters were drawn so well that I would forget they weren't real. This is a great book to read and it accurately portrays American cities at the rise of industrialism and materialism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I really enjoyed the first 495 pages of the book, with Dreiser's excellent descriptions, analyses, and an excellent plot.

If Dreiser had spent just a few more paragraphs, it would have made for a much better ending, but still, a fine first book from Dreiser."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"This turned out to be a surprisingly powerful novel. It starts out as a tale of a \\"fallen woman,\\" but ends up being the story of a broken man. Dreiser answers the question: what happens to a man who acts on his midlife crisis? Although the eponymous heroine is the catalyst for many events in the novel and the character through whom Dreiser explores the effects of materialistic culture upon the developing personality, this novel is really about George Hurstwood, a man who leaves behind his comfortable life, job and family and runs off with Carrie, a beautiful younger woman.The novel is set in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Young Carrie Meeber is a Wisconsin country girl determined to start a new life who one day boards a train heading for Chicago. It is the first time she has ever left her small town. Carrie's personality is unformed. She is impressionable and easily swayed -- but ambitious. As a character, she is interesting mostly for the effects she produces on the various men she meets and for the way in which her personality is molded by the attitudes of those around her. Carrie quickly realizes that money is everything in the big city. Material possessions define the man or woman. Money determines social status. Money enhances beauty. A person who does not have the best clothes, a beautiful home, and the wherewithal to dine in the best restaurants and to visit the hottest nightspots is not really much of a person, Carrie concludes. This is one of the major themes running through the novel, the idea that our very essence is defined by others and how they perceive us (with the depressing corollary that others judge us based upon our income). The strongest, suavest, most self-confident personality may be broken down to nothing if deprived of wealth and its appurtenances. Conversely, money has the power to catapult a nonentity to the highest social echelons. There is one character, Bob Ames, who attempts to dispute this worldview. Bob is an intellectual who appears at intervals throughout the novel, each time telling Carrie that noble deeds are more important than money, that she should read Balzac and Hardy instead of trashy novels, that she needs to contribute something substantive to the world instead of falling for the meretricious charms of the high rollers. Yeah, whatever, Bob. Yawn. I think that Dreiser intended for Bob Ames to be a pivotal figure in the novel, a person of depth battling for Carrie's soul against the claims of the material world, but Bob's arguments are not very convincing in light of the story's bleak ending. Although Dreiser leaves open the possibility that Carrie will eventually embrace Bob's philosophy, it seems unlikely. Why should Carrie listen to Bob when everything with which she is surrounded exhorts her to favor superficial appearances over internal substance?There are two brilliant portraits of men in this novel. Charles Drouet, a \\"genial egotist\\" and Carrie's first lover, is the spitting image of one of my ex-boyfriends. I suspect that most women have a Charles Drouet in their pasts because he's the type of man who holds great appeal at a certain time of life: the dashing, well-dressed, ridiculously self-confident ladies' man who is committed to nothing except his own pleasure, who genuinely likes women (on a shallow, self-serving level) and wounds them only inadvertently - that is, he does not maliciously seek to hurt anyone; he does so only as an unintended side effect of his self-absorption. The most masterful portrait, though, is that of George Hurstwood. The last third of the novel details his decline from wealth into seediness and finally into poverty, and it's some of the best writing I've encountered in a long time. (Drusier's style in the first two-thirds of the novel is bombastic - truly tedious at times -- but the last third more than makes up for it.) Anyone who has ever been unemployed for a long period of time will relate to the description of the lethargy and depression that sets in as Hurstwood's prospects grow dimmer, the self-doubt that takes hold and begins to emanate from his pores. I was on the edge of my seat during this part of the novel. It is SO GOOD. It is wrenching to see how Hurstwood's personality changes in response to his altered position in the world. When he is no longer accorded the respect that goes along with having money, he becomes a different man. Through Carrie's eyes - \\"the eyes of the world,\\" Carrie being both a product of society and its standard bearer - we watch as he is transformed from someone worthy of respect into an object of contempt.\\"Sister Carrie\\" was controversial when it first came out due to its profanity and sexual references, and it was released in numerous \\"edited versions.\\" I read the Penguin \\"unexpurgated edition.\\" It is disappointingly tame (for example, the sexual references are so oblique that I was unable to detect any of them), but I recommend the unexpurgated edition because other versions change the ending and cut out whole passages.This is a great novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Sister Carrie is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it at least twenty times in the past sixteen years. I'll spare you the literary review, which I'm sure you can read anywhere, and tell you why it still holds interest for the modern reader.Theodore Dreiser's attention to detail was definitely one of his major strengths as a writer. I've always found the details of late 1800's Chicago and New York fascinating in this novel. If you are particularly interested in this time period, you may want to read this novel for the everyday historical details alone.The coming-of-age theme is also one that modern readers can relate to, even though Carrie is from a different time. She leaves behind her small town and her family at the age of eighteen and is dazzled by city life. We can all relate to the degradation and desperation she feels as she seeks out her first job, and her desire for independence. Ultimately, she is successful, at least in a material sense, and the journey the reader follows her on is engaging.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I would highly recommend Sister Carrie. I have read most of Dreiser's other novels and several of his short stories. This is by far the best of his works, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Don't bother ordering this version...within a few paragraphs, one can tell that the book was transcribed very poorly, possibly by someone for whom English is not their first language."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"The 19th century marked the turning point, when mankind began to be urban rather than rural. All over the world, a process started of people abandoning their old homes and heading for the bright lights and the lure of fortune in town. It's still going on in much of the world. Similarly, writers of many nations traced the stories of such people, writers like Zola, Balzac, Dickens, and even Horatio Alger, who made a clich&eacute; out of it. (Nice work, Horatio !) Theodore Dreiser wrote this classic novel at the beginning of the 20th century, about a girl who leaves a Wisconsin backwater for Chicago. Unable to make ends meet through the drudgery of factory or shop work, she winds up as mistress to two men, the second of whom gives up home, good job, and family for her, committing a crime along the way. They flee to New York, where, as the long story unfolds, Carrie becomes a successful actress while Hurstwood, her star-crossed lover, slowly hits bottom, becoming a scab in a street car strike, having gambled away what little money he possessed.This gripping tale will take you time. It is couched in 19th century terms, that is, while it is about sex and power relationships between men and women, it is anything but explicit. Carrie at first is just a kept woman, but after an unexpected success in an amateur theatrical, she gains power. The themes of instinct vs. reason and raw desire vs. understanding suffuse the book. Carrie seldom thinks her way out of any situation, she isn't a schemer, rather more of a dreamer; she falls into everything almost by accident, but uses her sexuality to succeed and climb out of poverty.Unlike most literature of the time, and certainly unlike much of Hollywood's products over the years, a life of \\"sin\\" does pay here. Carrie climbs the social and economic ladder, despite her discontent with Hurstwood's lack of gumption. It's all quite the opposite of the American dream of Lincoln-like figures succeeding by dint of their hard work, study, and dedication. She merely longs for pleasure and luxury and through sex, clothes, and looks, plus taking advantage of small 'breaks', reaches her goals. She realizes along the way, though, that there is more to life, but she cannot conceive of what that might be. We leave her at last, a lonely, but successful figure, sitting at the window.This is one of America's classic novels. It goes without saying that it's worth five stars. Great story, great writing; it evokes the times so well, you feel as if you knew them yourself."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"Written at a time when women still lacked the right to vote, Sister Carrie offers an uncommon (and not initially accepted) commentary on women and independence. It also addresses that timeless theme of how the city changes the individual. Dreiser's turn of the century novel chronicles the young adult life of Carrie Meeber, who leaves her small town home for a more exciting life of Chicago. Taking residence at her sister Minnie's meager apartment, Carrie is immediately plunged into a pit of lower class struggles; to pull her weight she takes a job as a factory girl in a shoe shop for wages that can barely afford her basic necessities let alone the simple pleasures of Chicago life. Not quite used to the rigorous demands of intense manual labor, she yearns for something greater. By chance, she bumps into a wealthy, flirtatious gentleman - Drouet - whom she had previously met on her train ride into Chicago. His initial courting is unsuccessful but he eventually takes Carrie on as a kept mistress. Their relationship is at best superficial. He offers material things and compliments to her beauty.Without spoiling the rest of the story, Carrie's raw and innocent drive for success takes her on a series of relationships and adventures first in Chicago and later in New York. As a historical piece, Dreiser provides vivid descriptions of these two cities right down to the street level. He treats the city as a state of mind, with narrative insights weaved between powerful stretches of dialogue.100 years later, present-day readers might see Carrie as a heroine, despite her unabashed materialism. This was the very reason for its lack of marketing support; the historical fact is that the wife of Doubleday's CEO was upset by Carrie's bachelorette success going \\"unpunished\\" by the author.As was mentioned above, the \\"city\\" has transformed her into a woman who is set in her ambitions. Dreiser's style allows us to see things from the point of view of many characters and not just Carrie's. There are snippets of moralizing here and there which give the reader a sense that Dreiser was in some ways a prophet - he foresaw the unbridled potential of American individuality, its drawbacks, and how it is generally actualized in the American city. And for the time period, this was a paradox for women. But Carrie shamelessly lives her life they way she wants to. Classism and sexism aside, Carrie Meeber carries on the American dream."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"I had to read this book in college for a Modern Novel course. With the cover and title and length (and with 7 other novels to read that looked pretty good - except for Beloved, which is trash), I had to admit that this book looked like a huge bore to me. But from the beginning pages, you become part of Carrie's world, from her downfalls to her triumphs. This book showed me a bit of life that I knew little about and the story, plot, and writing style are excellent. I assume most people nowadays will only get the opportunity to read this some sort of class where it is required, but it will be well worth it! Surprise yourself with how good a book this is."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"In my opinion, there is no american author (with the exception of Steinbeck) who can create such powerfully moving stories like Theodore Dreiser. In Sister Carrie, Dreiser tells the tale of a girl who is disenchanted with her small town life, so she moves to Chicago in search of bigger and better things. The story is an amazing portrayal of a woman's life at the beginning of the twentieth century. Dreiser, through his characters, shows the difficulty of living as a single female trying to earn a living as well as maintain relationships. Throughout the book there seems to be a rather dark, somber mood, as if there is always an internal struggle and the dire need to improve one's life, but never achieving the goal. The romance, heartbreak, emotion, and power that are portrayed through the characters and their struggles are combined masterfully to make Sister Carrie one of the best works of fiction ever penned."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"&quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, first published 100 years ago, is Theodore Dreiser's ironic story of the acquisition and loss of wealth in a country devoted to commerce and pleasure. No one ever accused Dreiser of being sparkling -- one of my reference books calls him &quot;ponderous&quot; -- but he had the strength of his convictions, and he was convinced that American materialism was the root of American unhappiness. Caroline Meeber is a country mouse who, coming to Chicago in search of work, is pounced upon by big-city cats, including a flashy traveling salesman straight out of back-room jokes. When Charles Drouet seduces Carrie, it seems more like he's adopting a pet, she's so innocently compliant. And when she becomes involved with his friend George Hurstwood, it seems incredible she doesn't suspect that this middle-aged affluent man is probably married (or that Drouet doesn't reveal it to her long before he does). It is Hurstwood's abandonment of his family and embezzlement from his employers that is the plot's turning point. With his stolen money, Hurstwood and Carrie escape to New York, he to ultimate destitution, she to stardom on the stage. All this is interesting but terribly dry, like flowers pressed in a book. The main problem in &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is Carrie herself, who's such a passive character it's difficult to feel much for her. Even her success in the theatre seems to just sort of happen. (But, a reader may ask, if Carrie is so boring, how does she become a popular star? Well, turn on prime time TV for ten minutes and there's your answer.) Of course, there is no guarantee that Carrie's alluring situation is going to last -- I kept thinking of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw -- and Dreiser only hints at the fine line between stage work and prostitution a century ago. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is worth reading because it's a serious novel of life in a dichotomous society. Dreiser details with equal skill the drudgery of daily toil (not to mention the search for daily toil) and the glittering pursuits of those who can afford Michigan Boulevard and Fifth Avenue. If his style seems a little -- well, ponderous -- it should be remembered he was writing strictly from the brain. Dreiser really seemed to have no warm sympathy for the vagaries of capitalism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie","review":"It's a shame such a great novel has been digitized so poorly.

Ceilyn and Teleri must go against their principles of not using the old heathen rites to stop her. Afterwards this leads to awful consequences. The romance between Ceilyn and Teleri is really sweet, but sad. This book ends on another cliffhanger. The other thing I like about this author is how she tells you the story from many people's perspectives, but still in third person. Even the villian has her own chapters!

In desperation the British are driven to attempt to enlist the assistance of Serbian pirates to harass French trade in naval stores. A quirk of this novel is that Lewrie spends a lot of time on shore or in negotiations, rather than in his usual settings of boudoir or battle. While offered opportunities to play his usual &quot;ram-cat,&quot; Lewrie now acts like an &quot;old maid.&quot; Maybe it's understandable why this particular volume fell out of print.On the other hand, an attactive new plot device here is that the Great Enemy, Napoleon, is seen closeup with his admiring staff, plotting the ever-surprising tactics of his rapid conquest, er &quot;liberation,&quot; of Italy, in occasional chapters counterpoised to slow Allied expectations or Commander Lewrie all at sea. Also, in one surprising chapter we have no idea what's going on-has the author gone mad?-until the ruse is explained in the next chapter. While the infamous Alan Lewrie contends with the expectable obstructive superior, here this stock character becomes much more understanding and empathetic than usual, to Lewrie's discomfiture.

He was a hard headed skeptic of the theological arts, but took an intense, scholarly interest in it, and it was a boon to the universe of thoughtful men when he decided to report back to them on what he found there. The book he wrote will stand for a long while as the best of its kind--at once dispassionate and informative, with more than a little of his trademark wit thrown about with an undisguised glee. His enthusiasm for his subject bubbles out all over the place.The book begins with an imaginary story of how religion must have gotten started among the first primitive men. It is a story well told, and reveals what Mencken imagines is at the root of men's heart much of the time--a fear of the unknown, and an understandable aspiration to master that fear by some means. Then, very early on, the con men step in to utilize the fear for their own ends--power and cash. To successfully create a job for himself, he proceeds to invent embellishments unintelligible to the poor saps, and rituals that only the initiated, such as himself, can perform.The book continues with some comparative religion, basing most of it on what the Romans sneered at, that the Greeks made dramas about, what the Jews borrowed from the Babylonians, and what the Asiatics actually first dreamed up. He finds in all of this the roots of Christianity, and especially the stuff that Christ had never thought of, which the theologians later added for the most practical of reasons.His account of the early church and the evolution of the bibles is gratifying in its scholarship and clarity of description. He makes the ancient theological quarrels come to life, imparting an understanding that is a valuable addition to any freethinker's equipment. Occasionally, the real Mencken peeks through, enlivening and enlightening as he goes.The best part of the book, though, is when he shows how religion is inadequate for the job, and is in a full retreat before the onslaught of science and rational methods, leaving the truly civilized man with &quot; a way of facing the impenetrable dark that must engulf him in the end, as it engulfs the birds of the air and the protozoa in the sea ooze....not perhaps with complete serenity, but at least with dignity, calm, a gallant spirit.&quot;"},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"Pleasant, easy to read, and thorough overview of religion from the beginning of humanity, with an emphasis on Christianity, from the position of an atheist.From the preface: \\"My book is mainly factual. Its purpose is simply to get together, in handy and I hope readable form, the material data about the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of theology, with an occasional glance at its pathology....Religion was invented by man just as agriculture and the wheel were invented by man, and there is absolutely nothing in it to justify the belief that its inventors had the aid of higher powers, whether on this earth or elsewhere....There is no purpose here to shake the faithful, for I am completely free of the messianic itch...\\"Chapter I \\"Its Nature and Origin\\" - Mencken describes his view of how early priests came into being in prehistoric society: \\"One Spring there came great rains in the valley and on their heels a flood of melting snow...One night the flood rolled into the lowermost cave, cut off the occupants, and drowned a mother and her child...The rising water to them seemed like a living thing...One fellow steps boldly forth...He goes close to the edge and bombards his enemy with stones...Growing bolder, he stalks into the water and belabors it with his club...the next morning the flood begins to recede...This first priest could accomplish something that other men were incapable of...What more natural than to give thanks?...True religion was born at that moment...He took on the aloof, philosophical air of a dermatologist contemplating a rash: he learned how to avoid making promises and yet hold the confidence of his customers... He gave some thought to the form and content of his first incantations, and thereby invented the first ritual...The gift of blarney went with the sacerdotal office, in the early days as now...the new trade of priesthood had attractions that were plainly visible to any bright and ambitious young man...When he let it be known that there were certain things, done by the people, that would gratify the gods and insure their aid, these things began to be regarded as virtuous, upright, moral. When he announced that other things were frowned upon, they straightaway became sins...The priest found himself a law-giver...Did the fires rage and the sky remain dry? Then it was because the faithful had forgotten their plain duties...It was not the priest's fault...calamities were plentiful in those days, as they are now. They remain the most potent weapons in the armamentarium of the priest...Theologians, as a class, are practical men. Immortality, as they preach it in the modern world, is but little more than a handy device for giving force and effect to their system of transcendental jurisprudence: what it amounts to is simply a threat that the contumacious will not be able to escape them by dying...I am myself a theologian of considerable gifts, and yet I can no more imagine immortality than I can imagine the Void which existed before matter took form. Neither, I suspect, can the Pope.\\"Chapter II \\"Its Evolution,\\" continues as an academic treatise, but sprinkled liberally with condescending and clever phraseology: About creation myths: \\"In no department of theology is there a vaster accumulation of amusing rubbish.\\" About afterlife: \\"Even in India, the very gonad of theology...\\" About contradictions in the Bible: \\"The collection of tracts called the New Testament is so full of inconsistencies and other absurdities that even children in Sunday School notice them.\\"Chapter III \\"Its Varieties\\" is a study of comparative religions. This is a well-done academic piece with fewer \\"Mencke-isms.\\"Chapter IV \\"Its Christian Form\\" is a beautifully written history of Christianity, highly complimentary of the Old Testament as poetry and Literature, and is the best chapter in the book. He reviews the well-accepted J, E, D, & P authorship of the Torah, with brief mention of how it was compiled. (for more info on this, read \\"Who Wrote the Bible,\\" by Friedman). This chapter alone is worth the price of the book. According to the bibliography, he gets much of his factual material from James Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics.Chapter V \\"Its State Today,\\" resumes \\"Menckeisms,\\" such as, \\"The church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad laws, bad social theories, bad institutions.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining and informative book and highly recommend it. For a different approach to the same subject, I recommend Atran's book, \\"In Gods We Trust.\\""},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"In this sardonic, blasphemous and sometimes ferociously cynical pamphlet, H.L. Mencken castigates the irrationality and incredibility of all religions, e.g. there are 175.000 discrepancies in the manuscripts of the Christian New Testament.But he considers religion rightly as one of ( for him) the greatest inventions of all times, giving the clergy enormous economical (all the temples became extremely rich) and political power. For Mencken, their power comes from the fear of Hell. The God of love that they preach invariably turns out to be a God of harsh and arbitrary penalties and brutalities. Religion is not only cruel (human sacrifices), but also a source of enormous human misery: 'Is a Catholic bishop a good citizen, when he commands, on penalty of Hell, that poor and miserable women convert themselves into mere brood sows?'(p. 270)'The priest is the most immoral of men.' (p. 271)His major targets are Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.'Calvin was the true father of Puritanism, which is to say, of the worst obscenity of Western Civilization.' (p. 245) His God is an 'appalling monster'. (p. 272)The Churches are well aware that science is their natural enemy. Therefore, they try to control education. They are always on the defensive (Galileo, Darwin) and they are opposed to all attempts of rational thinking. For Mencken, religious education is the same as organized ignorance.He lambasts those who defend religion for 'practical' reasons: 'the fact that threats of Hell have their social uses is ... simply an argument against the human race!' (p. 268)However, H.L. Mencken has a dark side: 'the democratic pestilence'. Like Plato, he was disgusted with the masses which were a source of a cancerous proliferation of demagogy. More, 'the reigning theologians heated up the mob against the enlightened minority.' (p. 255)It shows his deep pessimism: the masses could not be educated and the mighty priests kept them in an irrational darkness.This is an important flaw in his reasoning and it turned out to be a false prophesy. In many democratic countries, the religious right is on the defensive and is losing (lost) important battles.This treatise is one of the most violent pamphlets I ever read: a Homerian battle of the enlightened one against the powerful caste of the priests.A must read."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"In this wonderful 300-page book, Mencken takes on one of his most persistent enemies -- religion. Although Mencken is heavily biased against religion of all types from the start, he impresses the reader with presenting him with the most recent and accurate research into the authorship, history, and linguistics (among other things) of the time. This displays a sense of fairness and scholarship far beyond what one normally expects of skeptical writings. Mancjen even goes as far as to commend the beauty of the Jewish poetry in the King James'Bible and seeks to explain some of Christianity's popularity in terms of its' aesthetic appeal to beauty and poetry. The books' major fault is that Mencken often assumes things of which he cannot be positive and which may not be totally accurate. For example, he ascertains that Jesus was not married even though this is rather unlikely, he maintains that Jesus had no political ambitions which is even more unlikely, he assumes that the only true religious impulse is fear and never considers the feelings of awe or wonder and he uses dramatic license in recreating the prehistoric ancestry of humanity and the probable historical development of religion. In some cases, this seems to make his underlying philosophical assumptions just as full of wishful thinking as those of his advesaries, but he tempers his natural inclinations by admitting that he is not objective about the subject that he is considering, and by utlilising as many historical and reliable sources as he is able to find. I was surprised at how objective he remained throughout the whole of the work. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"I had no idea H. L. Mencken wrote a book until I stumbled upon this treatise (shows you how much I know). Needless to say, I snatched it up in a heartbeat. The book is, unsurprisingly, a literary delight. I was, however, struck at how calm the tone was compared to the acid sarcasm in his dispatches from the Scopes trial. I have to confess, I enjoyed the peacable Mencken more, not that the old trouble-maker doesn't peek through once in a while to give us a good laugh. There is, for instance, a little passage about a &quot;rough Christian country.&quot; But I won't give it away - read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"Who says comparative religion has to be dull? Mencken is on his best behavior here, but his characteristic flash and dazzle light up the book. As \\"The American Language\\", reflects Mencken's enduring interest in words, so this book reflects his fascination for religion in all it's varieties from high-toned to gaudy. While innumerable histories of religion have appeared before and since, probably none are so gracefully written and engaging. Even the pious will enjoy it. As for the \\"admittedly damned\\" (HLM's phrase), they will enjoy it all the more."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"I'd scarcely agree with others here who suggest that this work is unbiased.

I quote the preface (which this edition includes and which I heartily recommend you not skip):\\"There is no purpose here to shake the faithful, for I am completely free of the messianic itch, and do not like converts.\\"Bias duly noted, I think. And appreciated.What concerns me more when I read an analysis of the origins, impact, and likely outcomes of organized religion is: Does the writer do a convincing job of defending his bias? Mencken most certainly does, in the brilliantly literate, bleakly romantic prose he mastered in his days as a journalist. The truly remarkable thing about \\"Treatise,\\" though, is that, for all its theological detail, it still makes the discourse about the validity (and absurdity) of religion utterly readable and conversational. Other than strongly recommending that you purchase the book, I would make only one more suggestion: Have your dictionary and your Wikipedia handy, for there are GRE words and theological arcana aplenty (but don't worry, they don't bog down the enjoyment). I leave you with one more taste:\\"The Reformers were men of courage, but not many of them were intelligent. The new theology that they brought in was quite as silly as the old.\\"Amen."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"Over the years this is probably the tenth or more copy of \\"Treatise On The Gods\\" (TOTG) I have purchased. I collect all books by and about H. L. Mencken (HLM). If a friend expresses an interest in HLM, I give him a copy because this is the most complete survey of all the Gods who have ever lived (and died). And they are all pretty much the same; in their demands, in their outlooks on life and their ability to create and destroy. Yaway (today's big time God) was the best at this. I give copies of TOTG away to fellow non-believers and grandsons who have to read it if they want any more money from me. Mencken maintained he was an agnostic, but I believe he was a thorough-going atheist. Not the suit-filing kind of atheist (10 commandments in the Court House, Ave Maria at high school graduation etc.) but one who believed and lived by Commandments 5 through 10. You don't have to be a Jew or a Christian to have ethics and live by certain decent standards. Mencken was a Conservative/Libertarian, one of the very few in democratic Christendom. When you get through with this epic, order \\"Treatise On Right and Wrong,\\" another and even better book on religion and right and wrong."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"I read this book a few years ago but am reading it again and wanted to share my views. I love how Mencken develops a very logical theory on how god and religion were created. It's certainly more logical than actually believing in one of the thousands of gods that have existed throughout the history of man.While the theory is great, the facts about the different gods and religions is fascinating. I wonder if Christians knew that the story of Jesus was essentially the same story as many other previous religions just re-wrapped with new names if they would still be so faithful? Just as gods come and go, another religion will eventually replace Christianity and the believers of that new god will call those who believe in Christianity fools.I often wondered as a child why people would accept Christianity just because they are geographically born in a certain location that is mostly Christian. The same can be said for any religion.If I'm an atheist and you consider yourself a believer, you are actually an atheist as well, you just believe in one more god than I do. I reject your god for the same reason you reject Zeus, Ra, Osiris, Amen, Isis, Tezcatlipoca, Vinitius, Horus, Aton, etc. etc. etc. etc.."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"If you're used to the snappy quotables we've (all?) come to expect from Mencken and love, you may be somewhat disappointed. \\"Treatise...\\" contains more carefully fleshed out analysis and argument than his sociocultural criticism.In this mode, without so much of the caustic wit, his writing style actually doesn't impress quite as much. But, to make up for it, his quality of argument and inventiveness is surprisingly rich. I'd always considered Mencken to be quite a philosopher, as well as a snappy come-backer. Here, he proves it: coming up with some quite brilliant hypotheticals about the origin of religion in early man, especially. And his re-telling of the concise history of Religion shows that he has a knowledge of considerable breadth. There are a few very dramatic turns of phrase here (the fun stuff), some awkward delivery, but a lot of interesting subject matter."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"This surprisingly neutral book compares the enormous variety of religious beliefs throughout history, with particular attention paid to Christianity. While not an in-depth text, it will serve as an introduction to critically examining the development and spread of religion.Christians should definitely read his chapter on Christianity; Mencken considers the 1611 King James Version to be one of the most beautiful books ever written.While his chapter hypothesizing the origins of religion is rather speculative, any such hypothesis is bound to be - at the very least it will pique your interest in the subject. The chapter on the variety of religions is particularly interesting, as it attempts to show how the same general ideas were molded into vastly different beliefs; in particular, the section on the various conceptions of heaven(s) and hell(s) will definitely be engrossing to anyone."},{"Title":"Treatise on the gods","review":"This book is Mencken at his best. Far from being biased, this book is the most objective approach to religion I have ever read. Most books that discuss comparative religions do not attempt to go to the beginning: when man first tried to tame the forces of nature through evocation of some deity. That speculation is actually one of the reasons why this book is an extremely valuable contribution to the philosophy of religion.Mencken does not claim that fear is the only religious impulse (as asserted below), although he does believe that fear is an important one. Mencken believes that the religious impulse is a desire to exert control over the forces that command one's destiny.He delivers a fair, logical, and certainly NOT biased look at religions world-wide from the beginning of history to the present. His critiques of Christianity (for example, his examinations of the Bible) are now accepted as true even by Christian theologians. The book's examination of Christianity alone is worth twice the price, but coupled with a dispassionate analysis of comparative religions makes it priceless. Mencken's discussion of the roots of many Christian practices make for enlightening reading. Regardless of one's faith, there is a treasure trove of knowledge here. Most people have never attempted to take an intellecutal look at religion or its history: Mencken does both, with this amazingly thought provoking and scholarly work."},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","review":"In the line of one-volume histories of philosophy, Popkin's History will immediately take its place as a classic.He includes not only the latest scholarship on the familiar figures and debates, but we also broadens the scope of what ought to be considered and studied in the canon of Western philosophy. This is a summa for the end of the 20th-century. The chapter on analytic philosophy is the most lucid treatment of that difficult topic I have ever read.Popkin has given us a gift in this volume. If you need a basic introduction to the field or if you need a large angle sub specie aeternatis view of philsophy, this is the book to buy."},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book could have been just another collection of essays on Western philosophy. Instead, Popkin's masterful organization, editing and commentary produced a lucid, well-integrated work. Ideas are presented and developed in the context of their times and mirrored against similar and contrasting ones. The result, in my view, is as seamless as a treatment of this vast subject could possibly be. Any future attempt to tackle this area will have to contend with this superb benchmark."},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","review":"The Columbia History is destined to become a classic. Richard Popkin assembled a small army of experts to write this history. The result is a text that is useful not only to the scholar, but to the general reader and student as well. Although a book like this suffers the danger that it will be simply a collection of unrelated essays on each philosopher or school of philosophy, Popkin provides notes that connect the separate articles. The thorough bibliography and index make this book particularly useful. Every student of philosophy should own a copy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","review":"When I was browsing on Amazon, I was surprised to see that this book (In Europe it is called 'The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy, edited by Richard H. Popkin and effectively written by -indeed- a 'small army of connaisseurs') had an average rating of 4.5 stars. To me the largest part of the book is utterly unreadable. Many sections seem like an endless row of quotations connected by lines of interpretative thought from each expert. No doubt that these people are experts in their field, but their capacity to transmit the basic ideas as intended by the philosophers discussed (or at least the interpretations of those ideas), is very poor. Nor do the discussions stimulate philosophical thought in the reader himself. Probably this might not be the purpose of this book, but in my personal opinion every history of philosophy should encourage the interested layman to contemplate on the big questions concerning metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and ethics. Or as Storig formulates it very well in his excellent 'Kleine Weltgeschichte der Philospie':What can we do? What should we do? What may we believe?If you are looking for the answers to these questions, do not read this book. The remark Popkin makes in the introduction of this book concerning 'History of Western Philosophy' by Bertrand Russell is really cheap: &quot;Russell wrote his book hastily out of financial desperation while jobless in N.Y.C. at the beginning of WW II. Since Russell was a scholar of very few topics he covered, and uninterested or hostile to others, his opus is most engaging as Russelliana but hardly as history of philosophy&quot;. And further: &quot;This work (Popkin's) is not intended to compete with this classic (Russell's)&quot;. Well, I read both and the conclusion is easily made. Pimlico doesn't come even close to Russell's. Indeed Bertrand Russell treats the history of philosophy in a very personal style and frankly ventilates his opinion on the great minds of western philosophy. But he does this in such a way, that it is still possible to get a clear picture of the original ideas unbiased by Russell's opinions. Also Russell's book does stimulate the educated reader to think and judge for himself. And, frankly, - but this is my personal opinion - although I do not agree with Russell's judgement in a number of cases, his statement that the philosophic ideas of some great men like Berkeley - who denied the existence of matter; material objects exist only through being perceived - are to be classified as insanity, despite the sometimes ingenuous arguments Berkeley made to support this view.I would like to spare one section from Pimlico's from my harsh criticism. That is the one written by Avrum Stroll on 'Twentieth Century Analytic Philosphy'. The eleven chapters he wrote give a very accessible introduction to this difficult subject, although I feel he could have spent more words on the Tractatus in the Wittgenstein chapter. Stroll's contribution prevents the rating from dropping to one star."},{"Title":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy","review":"The Columbia History of Western Philosophy narrates western philosophy in a more collective way than traditional histories of philosophy, and, for related reasons, its editor, Richard H Popkin, has called upon a diverse group of specialists to edit the chapters.This is both Politically Correct and academically conventional, but it means that the Columbia history is not a good introduction to philosophy for the general reader: instead it is an excellent reference book for someone already versed in philosophy.In former days, the history of philosophy was biographical, and focused on the thought of the major dead white males. .... Throughout his book, Popkin's authors provide this Politically Correct equal time and the general reader already well-versed in philosophy can learn much. But Popkin, in the selfsame interests of Political Correctness, fails to have his team judge, and for that matter, the judgements of a team are almost guaranteed to be a least common denominator. The sophisticated and academic reader can be left with more questions than answers, but the general reader is, I think, ultimately confused: did Plato mean what Plato said or was Plato messing with our minds? Should Spinoza have gotten married and settled down? Was Theodore Adorno a schnook or a good guy? ...."},{"Title":"The Space Tourist's Handbook","review":"One of my favorite volumes in my collection of space-related books is a library discard titled \\"Your Trip Into Space.\\"The book by Lynn Poole -- \\"Producer of The Johns Hopkins TV Science Review,\\" the title page proudly proclaims -- was published in 1953, four years before the beep heard 'round the world ushered in the space age, and eight years before anyone would actually take their own trip into space.It's a fascinating piece both for what it got right, years before the U.S. would being serious work on putting a man into space, and for what it got wrong. Practically on the eve of Sputnik and then Gagarin, the book boldly pronounces, \\"No one can give you the precise time and exact date for departure. We are willing to take a chance on predicting that man will fly out into space within your lifetime, at least within fifty years.\\" Emphasis theirs.Looking back from a little more than that half-century later, \\"Your Trip Into Space\\" really isn't of much use if you're actually planning your trip into space. But it is a captivating snapshot of the state of spaceflight -- and public perception thereof -- at that moment in time.Fast-forward now to the present, and a new book with a title that echoes the spirit of that half-century-old library discard, \\"The Space Tourist's Handbook.\\" This book's bona fides are equally impressive, with the name on the spine belonging to Eric Anderson, president of tourism company Space Adventures. (The author credit beneath Anderson's name adds, \\"And Joshua Piven, co-author of The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook.\\")To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the book when I first heard about it, and Piven's author credit did little to allay that. The success of his above-listed work has spawned a variety of imitators, how-to guides that promise the reader everything up to and including, literally, superpowers. I feared a book that might have some interesting information, but, in living up to its title, would fall as flat as those would-be Supermen. On the flip side, there was also the possibility that it would go the other way, serving as nothing more than a 192-page brochure for Space Adventures.The book's similarity to its spiritual forebear was pleasantly surprising. Like the earlier book, \\"The Space Tourist's Handbook\\" uses the conceit of preparing you for \\"your trip into space\\" to present a surprisingly complete picture of the state of human spaceflight at this particular moment in time. From the space shuttle to Soyuz to SpaceShipOne to Shenzhou (and many other things that don't start with S), the book provides an overview of all the major elements of spaceflight in 2005. A person who knew nothing about current events in space could pick up the book and in a couple of hours be relatively conversant about what's going on today. And for the reader taking the book off the shelf as far into the future as \\"Your Trip Into Space\\" is into the past would get an excellent idea of what was going on in this moment in history.There are times when that spaceflight overview is shoehorned into the book's space tourism approach. The book notes the prospect of the space shuttle being used for tourism may be \\"tantalizing,\\" and, while it notes that there is \\"no indication\\" that the government plans for it to be put to such use, to say that's an understatement would be an understatement. The book also notes that a spacewalk is \\"space tourism's ultimate walk on the wild side--the outer-space equivalent of bungee-jumping, parasailing, and skydiving all rolled into one amazing rush.\\" And that description may be true, but overlooks the fact that while EVA may be \\"just a single step outside your door,\\" that's one giant leap that no space tourist will be taking any time soon. (The space tourism bias also shows up in such ways as when it promises that \\"you will be an official astronaut upon completion of your sub-orbital flight.\\" That's \\"official\\" according to whom, exactly?)Those issues aside, the amazing thing about \\"The Space Tourist's Handbook\\" is that, in addition to providing an overview of the state of modern spaceflight, it actually lives up to its name. Unlike Poole's book, a person could actually read this book as preparation for their own trip into space. Granted, that's more because of the difference in the age than the difference in authors -- though, to be sure, Anderson has done his part to bring the change about -- but it adds a level of excitement knowing that chapters that still read almost like science fiction are, in fact, rooted in fact.Even if the $20 million price tag for a Soyuz ticket is slightly out of your budget, the space tourism hints can be fascinating reading while you're waiting for suborbital costs to fall -- the book shares everything from how to prepare for a spaceflight medical exam to how to pass the psychological exam (though one wonders if the tips for seeming sane were actually left over form one Piven's other projects) to what to expect during cosmonaut training to why not to play chess in space (I suggest a new strategy -- let the Russkie win.)To top it off, furthering its idea that the era of spaceflight for the average man is upon us, a card in the back of the book offers you a chance to enter to win a free suborbital spaceflight.So when will we actually see someone use this book as preparation for a ride as a passenger on a suborbital spaceflight? I am willing to take a chance on predicting that man will fly out into space on commercial flights within your lifetime, at least within fifty years.\\"And probably a lot sooner."},{"Title":"The Space Tourist's Handbook","review":"In one of the most unique formats for such a book, the author has produced a highly educational and yet entertaining book on space travel. Written in a tourist handbook style, it starts with a series of vacation postcard style pictures including space pictures, vehicles, and training. From there you turn to the various potential space destinations. This section includes Spaceports you might leave from and destinations you might go to such as a space station or the moon. Now that you have picked your destination you have to choose how to get there. The next section of the book covers space vehicles and systems you might use, what to do when you get there and the approximate price. This section includes information on zero-gravity flights, sub-orbital flights, space shuttle flights, Soyuz flights, and even trans-lunar cruises. For each of them it shows the approximate cost range, training time, and mission time. Of course it includes a section on space flight training including the various exams you will have to pass, equipment training, physical training, etc. Typical of most foreign tourism books it even includes a section on space travel dos and don'ts, personal items to bring along, and even how to approach and dock with a space station. The section on life on the spacecraft includes how to do the common tasks you take for granted here on earth including how to sleep in zero gravity, how to spacewalk, eating, drinking, bathing, and even using the toilet. And, when you are done with the trip the tourist handbook ends with a section on the voyage home. This section includes information on things like reentry and landing. An innovative way to learn about the space industry and what an astronaut goes through, or what you will go through to become a space tourist, this is brilliantly done and a fascinating read. Scattered throughout the book are some tongue-in-cheek comments that just make it all the more entertaining.

I enjoyed the book and commend it for reading by any one have the slightest interest in space affairs. The author should consider a new edition to be more inclusive of the more reasonably priced suborbital flights that hundreds, if not thousands, will purchase tickets to fly as the first decade ofthe 21st Century ends. The new FAA regulations effective in Februray should be reviewed and incorporated into the book and comparative analysis as to what regulations will be imposed in Singepore and the UAE as those commercial spaceports open on non-US regulated soil.

Potential space tourism destinations, from space stations to the Moon, are also covered. The meat of the book discusses training for space flight, recommended packing, the logistics of launch and space travel, and, finally, life in space. Like any good travel guide, space travel options are ranked by relative cost, training effort required, and mission time. It also offers a comprehensive index for quick reference purposes.Any engineer is going to know the majority of the information presented in this handbook, and anyone without an interest in space is going to be bored by it. The prime audience is students (and armchair enthusiasts) with an interest in science and engineering, who will no doubt glean both scientific facts and a healthy enthusiasm for the space industry."},{"Title":"Grown-Up Fast: A True Story of Teenage Life in Suburban America","review":"If you had a baby as a teenager and had a rough time, please read this book.

The novel is about Meghan trying to find answers to her father's death and why this girl looks so much like her. On Meghan's quest to find answer the story comes more and more unbelievable. With everything that Meghan finds it seems the less she knows about her father and the people around her.

You will see the heart ship that they go threw and you will ask yourself why. The novel will keep you guess till the end. In the novel Meghan has a conflict with her dead father. Meghan does not know what to think of him after she found some things about her. Meghan has conflicts with the people that she can trust and can not trust. I liked the novel. The reasons I liked the novel are that you never know what is going to happen next. You will be thinking one thing and then something else will come up and you will change your mind. In the novel you can never be sure of one thing or the other. The novel does fallow the style of Mary Higgins Clark. Where you never know quite what is going till you get to the end of the novel. You never know what will come next, with each new discover that the characters find. Then at the end the story makes sense why everything happens. The novel just like the other one I read. You will keep guessing what will come next and be surprised at what does end up happening."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"I found this to be an excellent novel with well-developed characters and an great plot. The plot began to thicken right from the beginning when the protagonist sees a stabbing victim that bears a striking resemblence to herself, while on assignment as a reporter. Every detail was carefully thought out, and every detail was connected in the final outcome. This book has everything: some science/medical jargon, an action-packed chase scene, a lot of suspense, and a love story. If you want to read a good detective story and love to try and figure out the ending, this book is for you. If you pay attention to the little things you may be able to put the puzzle together, but there's always a twist at the end. It keeps on the edge of your seat until the very end. I could not read fast enough as I waited to see what happened. I loved reading this book and would recommend it to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"I understand that suspense novels are by design meant to be a little far fetched but this book just had too many coincidences for me to find it even remotely plausible... The book was a decent read but definitely not one of my favorite MHC books. The ending was predictable. I suspected (won't say the name) the \\"suspect\\" from the 2nd or 3rd chapter. I was willing to look over the many coincidences but then the end just made me feel robbed...all in all if you aren't an avid suspense reader this book will satisfy you...if you are big suspense/MHC fan this book will dissapoint you."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"Television reporter Meghan Collins is shocked when a stabbing victim who dies looks exactly like her. She doesn't tell her mother about the woman, or the late-night fax she gets at home, claiming the woman's death was a mistake, because Catherine Collins has enough on her mind. Ten months earlier her husband disappeared, supposedly a victim in a bridge accident. The authorities did not find any remains of Ed Collins or his car, however, so the insurance company is refusing to pay and her bills are piling up. Catherine collapses and winds up in the hospital when someone calls, claiming to be her missing husband.Meghan had been interviewing personnel at a fertility clinic for a feature story, but when one of the clinic's doctors is murdered and it is found she falsified her credentials, evidence points at Ed Collins, who got the woman hired at the clinic through his professional placement business. Because of the scandal, Meg is placed on leave, so she uses the time to investigate her father, who had a lot of secrets. In addition to the double life Meg and her mother begin to suspect Ed Collins had, it is possible he had even more to hide. The burning question is...is Ed Collins alive or dead?Meanwhile, Meghan is being stalked by a parking attendant who took a liking to her, and he's hanging around her mother's house and place of business hoping for glimpses of Meg. Meg's feelings for her mother's neighbor, Mac, rekindle as she spends time with him and his small son, looking into discrepancies at her father's business and at the fertility clinic.Since the last couple of Clark books I read introduced a multitude of characters I couldn't keep straight, I decided to make myself a cheat sheet. I was glad I did, since there were at least a dozen recurring characters introduced within the first 50 pages. I didn't seem to need to refer to it very often, though. This was an intriguing story with several components all tied into one answer. In all, a very entertaining read that kept me turning the pages. This is definitely one of Mary Higgins Clark's better books."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"love all of Mary Higgins-Clarks work. This book is a long series of successful suspense. Her heroines are real and likeable. And the situations are up to date and trendy. I look forward to her next book. I must admit I like that her books are an easy read, usually one or two days tops."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This is a fun read. The main mystery is about Meghan's father. Mehgan tries to unravel whether her dad is dead or alive, if he had a double life, and if he murdered a unqualified fertility doctor after his disappearance. I really liked how all of these story lines flowed together and how they added to the mystery and suspense. I really didn't feel this story line was as predictable as other reviewers felt it was. I went back and forth between suspecting who the real murderer was and the ending surprised me.I also like how Higgins-Clark developed the characters. That said, Bernie really didn't add anything to this book. I am not sure what Clark needed him for other than to add a disturbed character.All in all this book did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"I just didn't want to finish this great book. I felt so close to the characters especially Meghan. This is a great read to take on a plane flight. The time goes by real fast. I started reading it on a Saturday night and read l00 pages in like 2 hours. You just never know what was going to happen next. I have always enjoyed a Sidney Sheldon book and have read all of his. Now I guess I am going to read all of Ms. Clark's. A great mystery lover's book."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"i absolutly LOVE MHC and i thought this book was excellent. i didn't think that it was slow at all!! in fact i thought it took off rather quickly. i would definitly recommend this book to everyone!!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"It kept me in suspense. I couldn't believe how it ended. I didn't expect it to happen like that. I loved the parts about Meg and Mac. I saw that coming. If any one is just starting to read her books, I suggest that you that you read this one first. I always figured that her father's partner had a thing for her mother. I couldn't put it down once I got it. I stayed in my room until I finished it.

However after &quot;I'll be seeing you&quot; my passion for her writing will diminish slightly. Not as exciting as the last seven I've read. Clark is a great writer, but you'd be better served to pick up &quot;Loves Music, Loves to Dance&quot; or &quot;Let me call you Sweetheart.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"The characters are fully developed. There are sub-plots on top of sub-plots. Until literally the last couple of pages, I was not only unsure as to whether there was a murder, I was unsure as to whether there was a death.

It kept you on your seat pratically. I give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"Once again, Mary Higgins Clark paints an extremely realistic picture that reaches out and grabs holt of the reader. This is the exact picture that she has painted in this book. The book takes you on twists and turns than leave you thinking that somebody else murdered the person, but it also leaves you HUNGRY for more. If you want a great book that will keep you reading for hours to come, then get &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot; by Mary Higgins Clark. I will promise you that you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This has to be the best MHC book that I have read.

The reporter starts doing her own investigation and as she finds out more and more about her father's life, things start going wrong and the reporter's interest is turned elsewhere, leaving her with the knowing thought that her father had another family out of state and that something is terribly wrong where her father worked.You know MHC will pull it all together for you and it really is an outstanding ending. All of your questions will be answered."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is one of those contemporary writers who can deliver a great story without graphic sexuality, violence or language. This particular book is one of my favorite Mary Higgins Clark books as it deals with the business of reproductive technologies. Over the last 10 years, I have read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"A typical (and dependable) offering from MHC. Although her books are formulaic (beautiful woman in danger has to use her brains and a little outside help to figure out how to save herself and close friends or family members), they are still enjoyable. Although there is the added challenge of figuring out if I've read this particular book before or if it's just because it's all so familiar because of MHC's [tried and true] formula. But then, that's part of the reason that I enjoy her books . . . they ARE dependable. I have almost always enjoyed her books. When I am traveling and need something to fall asleep to in the evenings, I can count on MHC to deliver --- and I can recommend her books to friends and not be concerned about which one they pick up or that they have to be read in order."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"An awesome mystery/suspense novel from Mary Higgins Clark. The best part about this book is it never gets stagnet. There are constantly new revelations, new suspisions, and I loved it!!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This book kept me reading from begining to end. It was great. I especially liked the topic of in vitro fertalization. There was many different elements in the story that lead up to a grand finale at the end. Easy to follow.. and you won't want to put it down. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark writes a pretty good mystery, and all her heroines wear GREAT clothes. What more does a teenage girl need to captivate her? Add in short chapter lengths, a handsome male suitor that is devoted to the protagonist, and a few harrowing twists and turns, and this book is almost irresistable for a young reader.No, it doesn't qualify as a literary masterpiece, but it definitely can prove to a kid why reading CAN be enjoyable. And for adults, I can think of worst ways to \\"escape\\" than with a good, easy mystery."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"I liked this book because I love mysteries. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. The book takes place in many different settings and there are also many different important characters. This book didn't take long to read. This book how alot to do with bonding and learning who you can trust and who not to trust."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This was my second Mary Higgins Clark novel. The two that I have read are the same in some ways. You never know what could happen next and you do not know what all the characters know one or the other in some form. In the two novels that I have read I noticed that until you get to the end of the book you do not know how all the characters will meet up. Her novels are the same style of writing but you can never put the novel down. Mary Higgins Clark novel I'll Be Seeing You is a suspense that will keep you guessing until the end.

The in vitro fertilization storyline made this book very interesting. I admired the fact that MHC did so much research on this topic to present it in a tasteful way. I loved the way she brought the medical and ethical aspects of in vitro to this book. I believe MHC wrote about in vitro in a way that didn't seem too technical and overwhelming. It added just the right touch to this book.This book, unlike some of her newer ones, is superb. If you've read some of her current works and didn't like them, give this book a try. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This is one of my favorite Clark books. The multi-layered mystery kept me fascinated all throughout the book. Unlike some of Clark's main characters, the protagonist in the book, Meghan, actually gets out there and does something to try and solve the murder instead of moping around the house all day. There were two things I did not like about the book, however. First, I didn't like who the murderer was. I realize Clark gives a twist at the end of her books and I appreciate that, but I just didn't like the way this one ended. Secondly, we do not find out what happens to one of the characters."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"I read the novel I'll Be Seeing You by Mary Higgins Clark. The book went into detail about how a man named Edwin Collins led a secret life for over twenty years. Mary Higgins Clark did an excellent job of describing the details of why he did this and how his family coped with his dissappearance. While all this was happening, she wrote about someone getting murdered and a fraud in a doctors file. This added a great thrill to the story and made it a page turner from the start. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes a murder mystery from The Queen of Suspense. It was a wonderful novel in which Mary Higgins Clark showed her exquisite writing style while including an enteresting flare to a murder mystery."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"A suspenful mystery filled with twists and turns.

After losing her father to an accident which everyone else (but her and her mom) thinks that her dad planned and just wanted to hide out and collect money. Meghan is faced with a story of a girl who was stabbed to death in New York City. But this was no normal homicide. Staring down into the face of the victim Meghan see's the striking resemblance between her and the girl. It is so remarkable that they could pass as twins. Through the months Meghan uncovers things about her father that she never thought were possible. How could her father have had another family in a different town? Is her father still alive? Soon Meghan is covering a story about an in vitro clinic. The fingers start to point at her father when a women ends up dead who her father placed in the Clinic. Or did he? Will Meghan live to see the outcome. Or will she be the next victim."},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This is not my first Mary Higgins Clark book,and nor will it be my last. She consistently writes mystery books that I find I cannot put down til I am finished. This book is definitely no exception.I'LL BE SEEING YOU centers around Meghan Collins, a television news reporter who in the beginning of the novel is covering the story of a stabbing victim, a woman that happens to look very much like her! Pure coincidence? Or is there a connection?At the same time, Meghan is dealing with the disappearnce of her father, Edward Collins, and because of the circumstances, no one knows whether Edward was murdered, or had just plain disappeared along with a huge sum of money. Both Meghan and her mother cannot move on with their lives because there is no body recovered from his supposed drowning off the Tappan Zee Bridge. At the same time, Edward is accused of murdering a woman that all had thought was a reputable scientist at a in-vitro fertilization center.Between the death of the mystery woman and Meghan's father's disappearance, there unravels a complex story of a man with a double life, a newstory about the in-vitro fertilization center, and the facts that tie all of them together.

She is so talented. Having also read 2 of her other books, i liked this one the best. Perhaps, it is because this is the only one i understood thoroughly. The suspense present in those pages make you want to pursue your reading to see what happens afterwards. Like many of this author's other books, we can see that she makes us suspect the one person that is not the murderer or the criminal. Therefore, she puts us on the wrong path. At the end, you figure out that the bad guy in the story is the one you would have least expected. For example, I would have never thought that Hefferman was that important in the story. I thought he was just there to mislead us. But i sort of suspected Carter near the end. Clark's way of narrating is great. An advice to people whose eye is out for an adventure: read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ill Be Seeing You","review":"This is my most favorite Mary Higgin Clark book.

In trying to identify this mysterious doppelganger, Meghan investigates an in vitro fertilization clinic and tries to piece together the events surrounding the mysterious death/disappearance of her father.

I would not be interested in reading this book again."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"This book, based on the five issue miniseries starts off promising, with great Templesmith (30 days of Night) art and an intelligent story about a therapist and a disturbed patient who travel to the town of Silent Hill.However, at chapter three, the story and Templesmith are both abruptly discarded. New artist Salman takes over. He has an interesting artistic style, but the difference in the artistic style is jarring. It is also hard to follow the story from the artwork. Moreover the direction the new story takes, about a biker chick who practices witchcraft, doesn't make sense with what came before it.Why didn't this book stay with the same artist and the same story?"},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"I was very excited when I picked this TPB up since I couldn't think of a better publisher to attempt a comic series attached to the popular Konami survival horror game, Silent Hill. The fact that Ben Templesmith (probably best know for his work on the hilarious Cal McDonald mystery series with writer Steve Niles) was the assigned artist only increased my expectations. IDW managed to surprise me by completely missing the mark.Dying Inside opens with the introduction of a disillusioned doctor named Troy Abernathy, a man who has become disgusted by his own fame and popular self help books. A friend of his asks him to try his hand at helping a mentally disturbed patient named Lynn DeAngelis, since they can't seem to pinpoint the source of her fears. Lynn apparently used to be a young journalist, who suffered some kind of attack while filming in a town called Silent Hill. Troy becomes emotionally invested in his patient, as he thinks he understands the reasons why this girl is tormented by her past. he makes the mistake of taking her back to Silent Hill to confront her inner demons, but naturally, they end up having to deal with real blood-craving monstrosities caused by a small child named Christabella. The reader later finds out that Troy's past is full of nasty little secrets, thanks to a manifestation of his dead wife and best friend (whom we later find out Troy killed with a shovel). In an incredibly dramatic fashion, he sacrifices his own life, so Lynn can escape. She apparently DOES and is picked up by some elderly couple on the side of the road. We never find out what happens to her later, as the story takes a different twist completely. Lynn's digital camera is intercepted at the hospital and her video is watched by a bunch of Goths, who decide they could make some money by visiting the town themselves. Around issue 3, Templesmith is ditched for Aaadi Salaman, which effectively destroys the mood Templesmith effectively created with his style. Lauryn, the punk leader of the Goth teenage group, apparently has ties to Silent Hill and Christabella is later revealed to be her deceased younger sister. Her friends are slaughtered and Lauryn finds out she has some vast demonic power over the town, and somehow uses it to defeat her sister and turn her friends into zombies. All of the Silent Hill fans are now scratching their heads and saying \\"What just happened?\\"The story is very disjointed and full of plot holes. Honestly, the comic reads like Scott Ciencin just gave up on the story after the second issue, then had the rest filled in by a Mary Sue fanfic. The story really has no ties to the original game and fails to do it justice. I probably should have stuck to buying the first two issues of Dying Inside, since the story and art didn't offend me as much as the sudden transition to super powered punker-witch Lauryn.I'd probably suggest picking up the first two issues to fans as well, but don't expect much originality when it comes to settings and monster designs. The creatures are taken straight from the games and the backgrounds are practically nonexistent. Aside from some of the blood graffiti in the street scenes, the rest of the comic fails to deliver any spooky surroundings. Salaman seems to have confused blurry, dark smears for tension and mood creating backdrops."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"If you're a fan of the Silent Hill franchise as I am, you're probably looking for something that expands on the mythos surrounding this little New England creepshow.What you get in Dying Inside is Scott Ciencin's first attempt to tell a SH story as guided by horror comic legend Ben Templesmith. Fans of Ben's artwork will see the evolution of his linework between his previous \\"Cal McDonald\\" pieces and most recently, \\"Fell.\\" Until book three that is.For some reason, IDW dropped Ben in favor of comic artist Aadi Salaman starting with book three. Strangely, the whole story shifts at that point as well, making books 3 - 5 a sequel to Dying Inside, but not a part of the original tale as the story arch title would make it appear.While Aadi's artwork does fit the mood, and isn't a total 180 from Ben, it does show a lack of visual flow from panel to panel, often leaving the reader to fill in the blanks where Scott's story was probably light on detail. In the end, it's like listening to a hyperactive four year old tell you about his trip to the mall... but with pictures.If you can get around all of the bad points, Dying Inside does want to share some interesting twists with the mythos. You have to really work at it though."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"I can tell that these authors are hot hardcore fans of the great Silent Hill videogames by Konami because if they were, they wouldn't publish something that's more of an insult than interesting. It has very little potential and the pictures and art may be liked by graphic novel fans, but I certainly despised it. If you're not a Silent Hill gamer, you may like this but I am one, and I felt it insulted and really made Silent Hill look bad."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"The other reviews to this comic was right. It wasn't a very good comic."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"Okay when you think of Silent Hill, you think scary monsters, demons and messed up people. Well, in dying inside, you don't get any experience from the game, except maybe in the first few chapters (just 1 and 2). Dying Inside starts off with a man trying to find a cure for a girl with psychosis. He brings her to Silent Hill and all this bad [...] happens. The first two chapters follow the basic Silent Hill 2 aspect and implement it well, but the downside is the art-it isn't that great.When we begin chapter 3, we are introduced to Lauryn who wants to go to Silent Hill because of a tape of the story mentioned above and runs into her dead sister. The art work becomes better, but the storyline is worse. Heck, you only get a few monsters only one of which is actually from the game. You always are missing something in this book. If you must read this comic, which I would advise against, go buy the Silent Hill Experience for PSP if you have one. It comes with this whole comic as well as some other videos and you save money.The only thing scary about this comic is that it doesn't live up to the series at all. Fans, you have been warned. Stay far away from this embarassment if you can."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"I can't really say much for this book. It rehashed and reused monsters from previous games; having a head doctor in the story should have created far more interesting monsters. It seemed like the story started out with nothing more then an idea, and the writed decided to just see where the story led him. Stories should always be on a leash, guided and molded into what they are. otherwise you get this story. The only person EVER to have gotten away with letting the story walk itself is the creator of Bob and George of www.bobadgeorge.com .The art (both styles) are unaatractive, yet somehow fit. I liked the idea of having the riddles on the wall, and I felt like taking notes. But I didn't; the story was more like what a non-Silent Hill player viewed Silent Hill as.Nothing to see here, move along, move along."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"As a fan of the Silent Hill series and its twisted mythos, I was hoping that the comics would expand on that. That the one shot stories with original characters would be worth picking up. While Dying Inside is not as bad as the others, it wasn't that great either.The artwork may have worked if you could actually see what was going on. There were times when the scene was so muddled that I couldn't tell the difference from one of the living human characters or a piece of rancid flesh.The story isn't that strong either. I've seen fanfiction writers do better jobs with the Silent Hill story and create a greater sense of dread in me.Dying Inside does not capture the essence of Silent Hill. That's just my opinion though. I leave it up to others to make their own."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"The twists were okay. There were some decent ideas wrapped in here.The writing style of the dialogue can be a bit iffy in certain spots, but what comics don't have this problem? The speedy pace is what I have more problem with. This author jumps from point to point a little too quickly for my taste. It's very hyperactive and doesn't flesh out very many details. Usually, in comic books, this is completely fine, because the artwork gives most of the detail... But this brings me to my next point: The art is mostly very stylish, however, it can be difficult to tell what's happening at many points because it's so blurred and scribbled. (This problem is mostly in the last few issues, since a new artist was brought on board.) The choppy writing and stylishly incomprehensible art combine for an aesthetically pleasing, but conceptually confusing read.The mood and attitude stray a little from what Silent Hill works usually bring. This is the type of thing that would be better if it wasn't labeled as a Silent Hill piece. As it is, it works fairly well though. It adds new elements and tries new things. It works well enough in this comic, but I definitely wouldn't use the plot for another game or movie... It just doesn't fit well enough.Give it a read if you're curious, but don't expect a story that's much like anything we've seen in the games or movie."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"the only thing that makes this comic book good is ben templesmith's part. his art and his story are amazing. once the third chapter finishes and another artist takes over this comic book turns for the worst. his style isn't bad but it's not as good as ben's work. he twists the story so much that the entire thing turns into a convoluted mess. get this if you're a fan of silent hill or ben templesmith.the story doesn't fit into the silent hill universe at all, but i'm sure silent hill fans will appreciate the effort."},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"The whole book had a great darkness and moodiness to it which I really liked. Still, I would not recommend it for the casual reader. I would, however, highly recommend it to all the avid comic book fans who have a place in their heart for weirdness and horror. If this applies to you, then read and enjoy. If not, look for your kicks elsewhere.Basic background story: Welcome to Silent Hill, a quiet little town teeming with the most horrible ghosts and zombies imaginable. Go in, and you will probably never come out alive. In this place, where evil runs amok, a vicious battle between good and evil is about to take place, and you can bet it's going to be Hell on Earth. Enjoy your stay... }:-)"},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"I am a huge fan of Silent Hill, so knowing the games as I do, I know that there IS no original story that these so called \\"fans\\" want to be familiar with when they pick up the comics. Not the same monsters? Well duh. Its called originality. Besides, Silent Hill was trying to show us in the first place that the real monsters are not the ones physically seen, but are within the human psyche. Not the same story? Again, duh. Every story of Silent Hill is different and leaves much to the imagination.Now on to the review. The artwork in this comic is made by two different people, why, I don't know. But there are differences galore between them. The first animated it in a way that presented a more expressive and dramatic side of the world and characters, whereas the second seemed to paint the world, making it a bit more of a pictorialization. They are both unique and dark, much of what I would picture a Silent Hill comic to be. (I should mention that there are 5 chapters, and the second illistrationist appears in the third and up.)The story, though a bit difficult to follow at times (as with any Silent Hill story) is entertaining if you don't think too hard on it.Whoo, I gotta go, but look my advice is to just relax and enjoy it, listen to some Silent Hill soundtracks while reading, or even better buy the PSP title (The Silent Hill Experience) and \\"experience\\" the digital comics of the same name (there is another one on there called \\"Hunger\\") plus it has music in the background throughout.As to be expected there are similarities and differences between the comics and the games, try not to dwell on them and just enjoy it, for God's Sake. Silent Hill is a town that screws with your mind, beyond that it is up to the imagination of others to turn endless possibilites into a story. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"This comic has some of the most expressive artwork I've seen in a long time. Nightmare slashes of color fight against a darkness that encroaches from every side. Demon figures lurk, half-formed, in ambiguities of shape and shade. The human (and human-like) figures are scrawled across this hellish landscape, themselves as half-formed as the world around them. The style is as raw as an open wound.That imagery is an ideal expression of the stories told here: psychosis, bizarre and vicious crimes, and supernatural revenge. The stories themselves tend towards the weak, though, scattered, and leave just a little too much unsaid. I had trouble engaging myself with either the plot or its characters. The artwork, though expressive, isn't as narrative as some. It pulled me along anyway, even if I'm not quite sure where it pulled to.The art is exceptional, as long as you can take it on its own terms. The story isn't much, though, and what's there isn't for everyone. I like it, mostly, but I expect opinions to vary. And no, I haven't played the game.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Silent Hill: Dying Inside","review":"This is a compilation of 5 issues of the first Silent Hill comix - Dying Inside.Highly recommended for all Silent Hill and comix fans!"},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"The book very nicely develops the basics of measure theory from a probability perspective (e.g. includes Caratheodory extension theorem, Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures, weak convergence and Kolmogorov extension theorem). It then gives a brief introduction to functional analysis and proceeds to probability theory, martingales and concludes with brownian motion and stochastic integration.All standard results are given and the book is self-contained. It is a concise, yet readable introduction to this area (less concise then Rudin, Williams but more than Billingsly). An excellent feature of this book is that full solutions to some of the exercises are provided at the end. This makes this book ideal for self-study. The only prerequisite for this book is elementary real analysis (say chapters 1-7 of Rudin's principles of mathematical analysis).There are other excellent books on measure theory (Rudin, Royden), but if you are interested in measure theory from a probabilistic view this is the book to choose.As far as a probability textbook, it is clearer and more readable than Billingsly, Chung, Williams and Durrett."},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"I first used this text in the earlier version, which comprises the first half of the book, in a one-year course in Hilbert Spaces and Lebesgue Measure theory when in the first year of grad school. The material is presented in a clearly written manner and the exposition is some of the clearest mathematical writing I've seen in a subject which is replete with textbooks.Anyone who wants to be inaugurated into the &quot;mysteries&quot; of measure theory and the fine points of the rigorous theory of stochastic processes and the Ito integral, will do himself or herself a favor by using this text. If it is not assigned to your class and you have the extra cash, order it anyway. It is also well-suited for self-study."},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"This book deal with the whole picture of probability. One learns the very first roots of rigurous probability. And when I say rigurous I am not regarding it as \\"engineers rigour = nothing\\" but as \\"mathematicians rigour\\". The book is self-contained, the exposition is clear and is organized in the mathematic classical fashion: definition, lema, proof, theorem, proof.That rigour, when it comes to probability beyond \\"number of successful cases / total number of cases\\", can only be achieved when the theory is developed in the most general background: measure theory. This gives general tools (theorems) which are applied to measures in general, a particular case of which is probability. Measure theory and general abstract Lebesgue integration go together, so the book defines and deepens in Lebesgue theory: integration, convergence theorems, Fubini's theorem, etc.Once you feel confident and capable of deal with almost anything regarding Lebesgue integration the books moves on relations between integrals and measures: the Radon-Nikodym theorem which is perhaps one of the most important results of the book and whose proof is outstanding. It provides the reader with the tools to tackle Lebesgue almost everywhere differentiation theorem and absolutely continuous measures and functions.Finally, before starting with probability as special case, there is a functional analysis chapter which gives proof of the three most important theorems of functional analisys in Hilbert and Banach spaces.From chapter 4 on, everything about probability is covered. From basic distributions to martingales, ergodicity or central limit theoroem. But instead of making up ad-hoc theorems, theorems proved for measures in first chapters renders the proofs in this stage simply colloralies.Once you read the book you will feel confident about anything touching probability, measure theory and Lebesgue integration and equipped with the most fundamental tools of functional analysis which are used widespread.I couldn't recommend the book more."},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"This was my textbook for a course in Probability Theory that I did in my third year at college. I had course work in Probability, but this course took a measure theoretic approach to probability. This book does the same. I found that the book is written for an audience that already understands some measure theory. That notwithstaning, I still think the book is an excellent introduction to Probability through measure, and is one of the most comprehensive books on the topic. Almost everything one might want to talk about in the subject are dealth with thoroughly. For first timers, the book is a little difficult to follow, but a little perseverance should pay off. This book is something every grad student of mathematics should have on his bookshelf. This also happens to be one of those rare math books that have a selection of the exercises solved at the end. Cant ask for more, can you?I also recommend K L Chung's book on advanced probability. Sometimes when I was stuck with Ash, I referred to Chung."},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"This was the fourth book I tried when I attempted to give myself an introduction to the Lebesgue integral. I found it to be, by far, the most accessible among them. It is written in a very clear style that is easy to read (well, as far as mathematics texts go), which is certainly not a property shared by all books on this subject. Anyone with a little patience and a basic introduction to epsilons and deltas should be able to successfully tackle this book.The fact that the book goes on to develop the theory of probability is an extra bonus: I think this book is worth it just for the first 3 chapters. Although it isn't nearly as thorough as something like Royden, it sets you up with the most important results as quickly as possible, giving you the tools you need to begin thinking in a new way.The problems that I have done are generally of high quality. They illuminate edge cases and help you understand the consequences of the theorems and definitions. Some of the problems have solutions in the back, but it never hurts to have someone knowledgeable you can run your ideas past when you get stuck."},{"Title":"Probability & Measure Theory, Second Edition","review":"The information in this book is so concise.

Ellen eventually marries him but her desperate posessiveness grows worse. She will stop and nothing, even murder, to see to it that Richard is hers alone.The book gets into the heads of all the major characters and I was impressed at how well the author writes from the female viewpoint.

So, in these hundred-or-so pithy and entertaining pages, he shares with readers some core truths about creativity and its psychology. Courage, as the book's apt title implies, is at the very heart of creativity, since to be creative requires us to risk seeing reality anew, and to try (typically not wholly successfully) to express our experiences in creative work, despite the anxiety such soul-searching and self-revealing endeavors inevitably engender. Creativity always requires taking a chance on one's self-- meeting one's unconscious, or shadow, or what May called the daimonic--and moving ahead despite self-doubts, discouragement and anxiety. Courage, as May makes clear, is not the absence of insecurity, fear, anxiety or despair, but resides in the decision to move through these feelings as constructively or creatively as possible. For anyone struggling with the creative process, this classic meditation on creativity can provide welcome encouragement."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"I have taught a Psychology of Creativity course for over 13 years now and this has been the only book I have ordered for every single course. Not only does May describe the creative process (e.g., the encounter), blocks (fear of life/death), environment (history, mythology) but he DOES offer real-life practical solutions in terms of self-questioning. A Humanistic, Transpersonal, Existential psychologist, May expounds on the \\"life is a journey\\" worldview: it is what we make it, yes, but not the \\"it is what \\"I\\" make it. WE, not \\"I\\". Laid out like a recipe, May discusses at least two paradoxes of creativity that other psychological theories might refer to as indicative of error. First, his definition of courage is the willingness to take action DESPITE despair. I interpret this not that creativity derives from despair but that it is better measured within the context of despair, for example John Nash \\"A Brilliant Mind.\\" Secondly he defines creativity as the willingness to be fully committed while keeping in mind we might be wrong (which brings to mind the cognitive concept of functional fixedness). Tolerance for ambiguity is a key characteristic of creative personalities. A willingness to move beyond the \\"ok\\" solution in preference for the \\"original idea\\".Physical, Moral, Social and Creative courage are each discussed in practical terms. Unlike many books which incorporate \\"creativity\\" in the title, this book truly focuses one possible reason creativity continues to elude empirical measurement, not unlike Heisenberg's \\"uncertainty principle.\\" We can know about the world/nature-at-large but it depends on what we ask. Perhaps there is another side to what it means \\"to know.\\" If this question intrigues you then read, and re-read The Courage to Create. It is a guidebook for lifetime existential quest that doesn't kick aside practical application. Tolerance for ambiguity--that's the key."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Some books age like vintage wines, gathering a film of dust thatdisuse protects until that happy &quot;discovery&quot; by an oldfriend. Rollo May's &quot;The Courage to Create&quot; was written in1975 - in a time when the presence of the atom bomb created an anxietythat prevented people to create for a future that was unsure, at best.Now in 2000, twenty five years of cosmic angst have intensified to afear of the limits of even a glimpse of a future and it is reaffirmingto return to Rollo May to regain the courage to &quot;rage against thedying of the light.&quot; In eloquent but inordinately accessiblelanguage May surveys the entire concept of Creativity with terse, wellselected passages from Plato and the ancients to Cezanne to Tillichand Kierkegard and Thomas Wolfe. This is not a &quot;How To&quot; bookor self-help rapid- read to solve superficial problems. This littlebook, when read slowly and thoughtfully, guides us through conceptsthat allow us to regain a state of positive thinking in a time when itis far more popular to dwell on our day to day foibles and transientmisjudgements.

Its essentially for everyone else; for all those whom deem themselves creative but dont know how to create. The title 'Courage to Create' epitomizes the core understanding of what is true creativity. In a nutshell, author Rollo May explains that to have courage is to move forward &quot;in spite of despair.&quot; This is where creativity is borne out of: out of despair. May then cites many examples of artists, mathematicians, musicians, and other forms where creative thought can be applied. He does not give the read a step by step process in how one can apply techniques, but empowers the reader with an attitude. The attitude of perseverance, encounter relationship, and expression of the deepest levels of our psyche. To be in constant search of ourselves is to be, in one sense, in despair and yet, to challenge that deparity is to have the courage. And by expressing that challenge, one begins to understand creativity. When we have worked and overworked ourselves, then frustration ensues where we leave our work. In this silence, our unconscious is still at work. Then we look bright-eyed and say 'Aha!'. We have created. Author May also includes other aspects that will be helpful to the reader in gaining more awareness and insight to anxiety levels and what the artist may be suppressing emotionally or cognitively. A wonderful book I highly reccomend that will challenge your limitations."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Drawing on sources like Paul Tillich, May writes ably about the psychology of creativity--but not in hugs-and-rainbows fashion, for as Stephen Diamond has emphasized in his own writings, creativity always carries what I think of as a dangerous edge to it, the breath of the daimonic. Read this book to see why creativity is so central to the human experience. (Dunno if I'm allowed to do this in a review, but (see below) what's the deal with letting people post reviews in which they admit they haven't even read the book? )"},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"First of all, who the hell writes a book review without ever reading it? Moving on, I would give limited praise for this book. In terms of May's other work, it does not surpass something like &quot;the cry for myth.&quot; I should like to bring to your attention that the book is a collection of lectures and vary in their quality when transformed into essays. A few are thought provoking and a few are irrelevant and the rest are in between. It's worth reading if you enjoy existential psychology and are curious about creativity. If you just want to know about existential psychology, choose a better book."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Two things really shine in this slim but rich volume: Rollo May's insight as a psychologist, and his basic decency & empathy as a human being. His exploration of the sources of creativity is one of complete engagement with subject & reader -- for all his obvious education & experience, he never succumbs to a detached & superior academic tone. He speaks to each reader as one human being to another.Be warned: this is not a how-to or self-help book. (But it's likely to help you far more than an entire shelf of self-help books.) What May delves into is the nature of creativity -- what drives it, why it's a necessity to both the individual & society as a whole, and the complex, delicate balance of powerful psychological forces it must negotiate.May explains how creativity enriches & enlarges our lives ... but it's not always easy, as it demands working in uncertainty, a kind of pregnant, hopeful doubt. We never know if what we're creating is actually worthwhile, or merely fairy gold that turns to ashes at dawn. Yet the heroism of it is that we work on through that doubt & despair to produce our work. And of course this not only applies to creative work, but the work of life itself. And perhaps the two are not so far apart?Formatted in a few short chapters, each of which is a complete essay in itself, this remains the single best book on creativity I've ever read. It's one I return to on a regular basis, considering it a work of art itself. It won't give you any simple step-by-step instructions -- but it'll make you think, and contemplate, and deepen your understanding. And in the long run, that'll do much more to awaken & nurture the creative spirit.Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Courage to Create has been on my to-read pile for quite some time. Strongly recommended by several friends, I was very curious to read it. This despite an admitted suspicion of books that address creativity from a psychological perspective.I found the book interesting and relatively clearly written. May resisted the temptation to pad out the work, and its 140 pages are perfectly adequate to make its point. The book is divided into seven sections; they run from \\"The Courage to Create\\" to \\"A Passion for Form\\".I found the sections relevant to creativity and the unconscious the least interesting parts of the book. This may be, in part, because the book was early enough (1975) that many of the concepts in those chapters feel a little bit like open doors. Courage to Create has been a very influential book and over the years a number of its themes have been picked up and expanded on-- sometimes in a more complete way. I was quite interested in May's thoughts linking form to creativity. Again, they weren't new ideas, but I found he articulated them clearly and with some perspectives that I hadn't considered until reading the book.Despite my reservations I would still recommend the book to readers interested in the roots of creation and creative ability. It isn't a lengthy read, and requires more time for consideration than it does for the actual reading."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Have you ever wondered how people have creative ideas? This books tells you step by step how. Using anecdote after anecdote from the past and the present May builds a montage portrait of creativity that convinces.

The first step is to spend an extended period of time concentrating on the ins and outs of your problem. The next time you have a difficulty to solve spend all morning on it 'hot-housing' the question.This book is probably May's most readable and entertaining work.

I had no idea."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"I found Courage to Create very helpful in becoming more confident at trusting the creative process. I am a graduate student in fine arts and sometimes artists sit and wait or have a lot of anxiety about the creative process. One of May's definitions of courage is having the courage to deal with anxiety. May also states that you can not force creativity but you can force the work. If you work hard enough the work combined with your unconscious will produced creativity, your own original thought. I have found this to work and have become more confident in trusting the process. I am not a humanist, and you need to read this book critically and not allow humanist thinking to get a root if you are a person of faith."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"Referenced in the great book Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz, regarding being fully committed to something. Useful to me because of it's relevance to committing to working with dog training through the ups and downs and high and low energy times."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"rollo may's works have been concise and insightful. i have read him off and on since i was in college. the book arrived almost immediately and in great shape"},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"There is a lot of positive thought in this book. It is one which encourages 'creation' and finds in it a moral basis in courage. It is also seeks to connect that courage with the individual's ability to explore and employ their own unconscious mind. My problem with the book is that it does not give enough examples. And it does not thus trace the very different processes of creation, the varieties of creative experience in a detailed and informative way. Only the story of Henri Poincare's mathematical discoveries at times of relaxation from willed effort, are given considerable attention.The 'creative process' as I understand it involves more than courage. It involves being blessed with a 'gift from God' that no amount of will or determination can replace. It relates to circumstances since there are periods in which an Art form is exhausted, and other times when many individuals seem able to create in new ways. Creativity too in a broader sense can as the Pragmatic philosophers showed , can be linked with almost every form of human activity. The link they make between problem- solving and 'creativity ' is a central one.There are many different faces to creativity. One central religious one, not explored in this work is the Jewish idea of 'creation as a whole' as involving a ' creative connection' between human and divine the working together to shape and build a world.May is a clear writer and one whose general approach does provide a certain understanding of the subject of Creativity. But there is more so much more, and so many other worlds and ways not related to in this fine book."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"May has some good insights into creativity--his positing creativity as existing between the subjective pole of the artist and the objective pole of the external world is a refreshing change from those who deny the existence of an objective external world.However, May is at heart a Platonist, which means that he feels that there is some sort of super reality or super organizing principle behind the objective external. He privileges the artistic insight as organizing the external, rather than organizing the internal perception of the external. Big difference--through insight, we readjust what we think about something--we don't readjust the thing itself (although many times a true insight is profound enough that it substantially changes the way we perceive the thing... but the thing remains as it is--it's just that we are seeing it differently, and hopefully more clearly).He also commits some absolute howlers--for instance, talking about the large dilated eyes of Greek statues as reflecting the physiological state of revelation--the eyes are dilated because they were originally stuffed with jeweled iris and pupil. The whole book basically smacks of insight unleavened by research and editing."},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"I believe if we are to create we must have courage. We must not be afraid to confront ourselves and our fears. Its easy to be apathetic, its easy to live off other peoples opinions, its hard to find our own, are opinions are our creations. It is hard to let ourselves feel comfortable with just our inside voice, why must we depend on outside voices, what we create is a reflection of what we have lived. Our lives are our creations, do we have enough courage to control it, why am I so vague?"},{"Title":"The Courage to Create","review":"I read it last... maby 15 years ago. And at the time, I &quot;bought the book by it's cover&quot;. And I &quot;lucked&quot; out: creativity is a frontier... and truth is tougher than the bad pulp-fiction that we can readily hash out and regurgitate to ourselves...and just as likely validate like the one too few lotto tickets that we bought with our &quot;home-boy&quot; friends -- but never checked the numbers: heck were too smart for those odds -- but then tell that to the longshoreman 50-60 something Vanghogh... ticket holder:::we're not talkin Dutch realism here:.

From the moment I started reading the book I couldnt stop reading. It takes you on an ubelievable journery from the beginning of their lives in this business to where they are now. It is so beautifully crafted. The book is literally story after story, but the way they were streamlined together makes it like one person reciting an autobiography. If there was ever a time that all of the tears of joy and pain from trying to \\"make it\\" were combined, it is in this book. It will inspire you to work even harder, not to be a broadway star, but to just work and do what we love. The only reason I put the book down was to run on stage for an entrance, seriously!"},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"For theatre people or anyone interested in acting this book is a MUST!! It actually is more about making &quot;it&quot; on Broadway. The Great White Way is strewn with many funny, sad stories. These are actors who make a living at their craft. Most of them are not household names but they work primarily in Broadway musicals. This book painfully tells of their youth, their dreams and their struggles. All in their own words.Some of it is very funny and some is very sad. They express anger at what Broadway has become and tell of the hard work and discipline that is required of them. There are some very amusing anecdotes about things that go horribly awry during a production.Dave Clemmons tells a very touching and sad story of a little girl who came to see him in &quot;Les Miserables&quot; in Salt Lake City. It has a happy ending but really tugs at your heart strings.The theatres are old and dirty, and most of the time the pay is not that great. But they do it because they love the theatre. The are all Broadway Babys. Read it, you won't regret one word."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This is such a great read! Theater fans like me love hearing actual broadway actors speak about what the business is really like. Most other Broadway books talk about either the history of theater or how vaguely to construct a show, but this book really gets to the core of what being on Broadway is about. Be prepared for shocking, hilarious, and sometimes even painful stories shared by so many revered performers. It's an extremely truthful and important read for everyone even vaguely interested in theater!"},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"A collection of commentary from Tony Award winners and other successful actors, Making It On Broadway gives a real-life view into the career of an actor. From the beginnings of their career when they first took an interest in acting to moving and settling in to a new home, survival jobs, live theater, Broadway life, the changing scene of Broadway, the personal life of an actor and problems that acting creates, romance, road trips, and finally when dreams come true, the whole life cycle of an actor is uncovered in detail. This is a very good book that shows the difference between the glamorized version of being a Broadway actor and what it really takes in terms of commitment, experiences, and the toll on your personal life. But it does not concentrate entirely on the difficulties of becoming an actor; the authors also discuss the thrill when you actually make it. When so many people have false ideas of what it would be like, and colleges and training facilities have a financial interest in encouraging students to remain it is a breath of fresh air to hear the viewpoint of all of these actors who have actually made it. Just like any other occupation, acting has its good and bad points and this book points them out from the perspective of people who did make it. Making It On Broadway is a recommended read for anyone who wants to pursue acting as a career."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This book is brilliant and worth far more than the asking price, if you ask me. Sure, it's got more than its fair share of funny and interesting little theatre anecdotes, but it's also a great textbook about the trials of being a professional actor, as well as a study in the commercialism of modern theatre. I'm actually using it as a textbook in my capstone Theatre course, as we're focusing a bit on \\"what makes a hit\\". I think that anyone interested in any aspect of Theatre should give this one a read; it really gives a fascinating view into it, as well as being just a really good read.Oh, and one of my favorite parts is the set of interviews all talking about the Les Mis entrance mishap... funny stuff. Warning: don't read this backstage, or you *will* almost miss your cues!"},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This book is so entertaining. I love hearing actors' stories in their own words, from their point of view. There are some great stories (My favorite section so far is the &quot;Mishaps during a performance&quot; section.) and some wonderful insight. Very well done.I am enjoying reading it so much that I have to force myself to slow down. I don't want to finish it too soon."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"&quot;Making it on Broadway&quot; is absolutely amazing. This book depicts the business as it is. Accurate and Ispiring! I reccomend this book to actors, people in the business, and theatre lovers! READ THIS!!!"},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"NO other way to describe it. Broadway or even the glitzy life of showbiz ain't all razzle dazzle. In fact, as this groundbreaking book describes, the life to stardom is fraught with poverty, rejection and even stiff competition. And let's not even mention the fact that almost 80 percent of the stories seem to reveal that the performers don't feel like stars anyway, no matter how high up the showbiz ladder they go. Many attest to having to work with intense apathy in the casts, and even having to deal with a disinterested management as well in areas so clear-cut in the corporate world, it's astonishing. What's also so liberating about this book is that many performers will instantly relate to the universal stories of living in cheap and tacky apartments, having no money, not getting on with their castmates and even feeling intensely lonely, in the height of their success.You could be forgiven for thinking that there is a slight hinge of bitterness in the book, but in all honesty, the book paints a real picture of a deeply misunderstood profession and will doubtless be a deep comfort to many a performer who will scream from their apartment, 'It's okay to feel this way, I am normal!!!' What's so good about the book is the way the stories have universal appeal whether in London, New York, LA or even Australia.Also causing a great deal of controversy is the topic of a mysterious 'gay mafia' in the Broadway business which selects those of a certain sexual preference over another , and the way that performers deal with it. If you bark 'It's so subjective!', you couldn't be more right. The book reeks of realness and honesty and seems to be cathartic in its very conception. One can't help but hope that every casting director, director and top management of every Boroadway show that exists will read it, reread it, reread it again,make notes, be humbled and instantly effect change.For the new performer, it no doubt will discourage or force a new drama student to count the cost of the profession and hopefully discourage many who are not meant to be in there from going in. And that's good. For the theatre lover who doesnt perform, it can only help you to appreciate and even understand and be part of the solution for a highly misunderstood and marginalised profession of deeply talented and misunderstood people."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"Whether you are a theatre novice or Broadway veteran, this ambitous work is insightful, educational and fun.On some nights, the theatre life is full of passion and wonder. However, many nights are spent in the hope of simply finding a job or landing a decent audition. Warts and all, this book is a must for anyone who loves a play or story. Enjoy and learn."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"For anyone who plans to go into the performing arts as a career path, read this book. Full of first hand accounts on hard the road to \\"stardom\\" can be, and what a fickle mistress the modern theater is.I couldn't help but feel slightly depressed when reading this book as theater has changed so much thanks to the advent of the spectacular. Actors aren't given the chance to be creative anymore, they're merely replaceable products in the modern musical machine. This book should be a requirement for all college theater departments."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"I bought this book recently and read it from cover to cover in 2 sittings.I highly recommend it. If I knew anyone who wanted to be a theatre performer, I would definitely BUY him/her this book.As a theatre fan, the book was an eye-opener and left me somewhat sad. It was especially interesting reading the contributions of Jason Alexander and Antonio Banderas.Most of the shows mentioned were musicals. Very little mention of straight plays. Thus the 4 stars instead of 5. But that's just a minor quibble."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This is a beautifully crafted book of perceptive interviews of the stars and the less-well-knowns among contemporary Broadway performers. Their words are woven into stories that move and frustrate, inspire and sadden those of us who love theatre, and live with or love theatre professionals. It's highly recommended for performers and would be performers, as well as for those of us &quot;audience members&quot; as it gives a rare, honest look at the commercialization and homogenization of the mega-musical, and insight into the actors who after years of honing a craft, find themselves hired less to create a character, than to fill a space in a business. Bless them for continuing, and bless Jodie Langel and David Wienir for the sensitivity with which they tell the story. A must read!"},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"No punches pulled here, no fluff.

Well here's your chance...told through the mouths of over a hundred performers, you'll get the chance to laugh, cry and survive with these performers.Many don't understand the heart-ache and sacrifices made by a performer. Many even think that Broadway is easy...but with each story you'll learn that is far from the truth.If you want to be a Broadway performer or just explore the life of one this book is for you...."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This book was recommended to me by a very good friend. Not only is it a humorous read, but an eye-opening one. This book brilliantly deals with the reality of professional theater right from the mouths of professional actors. If you are in the business, this book exposes you to so many things that aren't taught in school. It's a must read. If you are a theatergoer, this book offers a rare look into the lives of performers.

But I will defy anyone who doesn't think that this book should have a semester of coursework based on it at every notable conservatory and theater school in the country.There are many books that aspiring actors can read to learn the craft and skill needed to perform onstage.This is the only one I know of that can prepare young actors for life ahead of them OFFstage."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This is an absolute page turner, horrifying, funny, depressing, and sometimes inspiring. I am merely a fan of Broadway, not an aspiring performer, and, as my husband, who does not normally read this sort of a book but is engrossed in this one, said, thank heaven neither one of us has ambition to be a Broadway performer. An absolute delight."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"This book is a MUST READ for anyone considering a career in the performing arts...especially on Broadway. It's like having 150+ friends in the business who are willing to share their personal experiences and insights with you.

And Kudos to the performers who contributed their personal stories and thoughtful observations."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"I want a career on Broadway when I'm older.

I am reading all that I can to help him and our family to prepare. This book is in many ways the most useful. When I tell others of my son's plans they often say \\"that's wonderful!\\" After reading this book a parent could feel that such a career choice is about as wonderful as being a prostitute or a hired killer. The book lets us hear actors in their own voices and it is frightening (as well as funny and heartwarming at times). I was prepared for the lousy apartments and the menial jobs to make ends meet. What I was not prepared for is how bad life is for the stars. I was not expecting to hear that actors who are in the mega productions are not enjoying it and that they play games on stage during the show to avoid boredom. After reading this book I hope that my son stays in local theatre. Broadway sounds like a nightmare, especially since the takeover by the mega corporations, referred to as the Disnyfication of Broadway."},{"Title":"Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this book.

Basically Mallory is sitting for the Arnold twins and they are terrors, but it turns out that they just wanted to be individual people instead of dressing alike all the time. My favourite parts were the birthday party, the shopping trip where they bought new sophisticated clothes with their birthday money, and when the club members go on a shopping trip and most of them get their ears pierced after Mal & Jessi got permission and also the part where they got new earrings. But honestly, who waits that long to have them pierced at an older age? Most people I know, including myself were not old enough to remember getting our ears pierced, so it seemed really strange to me that most of them weren't allowed until them and some of them not being allowed until they're older.

As you would expect from the title, this is the story of a low borne brute, Billy Byrne, who wins the hand of an upper class lady, Barbara Harding . &quot;The Mucker&quot; ran in &quot;All-Story Cavalier&quot; in 1914 with &quot;The Return of the Mucker&quot; being published two years later in &quot;All-Story Weekly.&quot; Now both stories are published in a single volume.Billy Byrne is basically a street thug whose notion of honor is based more on a sense of territoriality rather than anything else. Just when things are starting to become too hot in Chicago he gets shanghaied and ends up on the brigantine &quot;Halfmoon,&quot; a 20th century pirate vessel. Surviving and rising in the ranks because of his ability to beat any other man to a bloody pulp, Billy participates in the taking of the yacht &quot;Lotus,&quot; where one of the captives is Barbara Harding, the millionaire's daughter. Of course he insults her, as is the way of the mucker, but when she calmly calls him a coward and a beast he finds himself thinking about how he much look to others, thus beginning his quest for moral regeneration. When she gets captured by headhunters, take a wild guess as to who is going to rescue her. Of course, at the end of the first part Billy takes the high road, knowing he is not good enough for Barbara and leaving her to return to the world to which she belongs, and then we repeat all the action in the second part and change the ending.You will find a little bit from several different early works by Edgar Rice Burroughs in &quot;The Mucker.&quot; The story starts in Chicago, a city that ERB knew well, and then turns into a sea yarn with a mutiny, which is how &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; began, except that this time the &quot;hero&quot; is one of the pirates. You will also find one of ERB's lost races, which would become a staple in the last half of the Tarzan series. The second half, which takes place after the Mucker does the noble thing at the end of part one, goes off into the Mexican desert and turns into a western. So there is certainly a little bit of everything here, although the strongest comparison is to the first two Tarzan novels, not only because the romantic plot follows essentially the same pattern, but because it also provides the brute becoming civilized. In that regard it is one of ERB's more interesting pulp yarns, totally devoid of the science fiction elements found in most of his better stories, but retaining his strong sense of human nature."},{"Title":"The Mucker","review":"Most of Edgar Rice Burroughs' heroes are highborn, chivalrous, and heroic.

And that one person you always have such a hard time buying for will be easier this year! Not your spouse, your boss! If you have been trying to get your boss to listen to your crazy ideas about SGML or want to let a new boss in on what all of that acronym stuff is - SGML, the Billion Dollar Secret fits the bill.Wait! If you think your boss won't read it - there's pictures! Cute little cartoon picctures that show the publications process as it relates to a busy executives job. The pictures are cleaned up versions of the ones we have all hastily scrawled when we try to show our friends, family, and bankers what we do.Chet Ensign has written the book we all need when talking to the mass market about SGML. The book outlines, in business terms, what SGML is, why someone would want to do it, and what a business can expect to gain by using SGML. Mr. Ensign does a grand job of taking all of the technobabble out of the industry and explaining in clear business terms the problem with information in corporate documentation and how some companies have solved it.And what companies! The real strength of this book is right in the middle of the book. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 are dedicated to in depth case studies of Sybase, Grolier, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Mobil Corporation. Each business case is organized in it's own chapter with a great little executive summary on the first page. The executive summary is invaluable because at a glance you can see if you want to continue reading the business case. Each business case presents the problem the company was trying to solve, details of what they did and the challenges they faced and then the tangible benefits they saw. Each business case is presented in a great narrative style so that we meet the people who made it happen and share their frustrations and triumphs. This very human approach to technology kept me reading even though in some cases, I already knew how it was going to turn out. If all of this sounds a little chatty for your audience, remember, the executive summaries are first and only one page long!You are sure to recognize your company as you go through these business cases. Mr. Ensign has done a good job of not only giving us various industries to study but also various implementation strategies - in fact, the only thing these case studies have in common is that they all saved money - big money - using SGML. Grollier changed out their authoring environment, Sybase didn't. Each case gives a compelling reason why or why not. For those of us in the consulting business, these case studies are a gold mine!One problem we have had with SGML is convincing companies that the up front investment was worthwhile. And we all knew people who were saving big money with SGML but our non disclosures kept us quiet - and most often our customers were unwilling to talk - even to non competitors. Mr. Ensign somehow navigated the legal and political waters that the rest of us were unwilling or unable to chart to bring these case studies to light. I, for one, am eternally grateful. There is an added bonus in chapter 6 when we learn the inside story of the Semiconductor Pinnacles initiative. As a member of another standards organization, I remember the dismay I felt when the Pinnacles group was able to accomplish in one year what our group had only begun after 4 years. Our company hosted a meeting in Dallas for the Texas instrument session of the Pinnacles analysis and the description of how the lonely semiconductor &quot;peaks&quot; find each other and share their common dream made me smile. Descriptions of the analysis process as &quot;Mud, Bricks and Mud 1&quot; is good preparation for any manager who doesn't understand why analysis takes so long. I like the metaphor so much, I plan to start using it with our customers.The first two chapters give an overview of why you might want to read this book and describe a hypothetical company (Typicorp) that is trying to integrate their electronic data into a new delivery mechanism sans SGML. The successful prototype is followed by the nightmare of true system implementation. We all know companies who have undergone this sort of effort but with the explosion of the World Wide Web and the continual changes in HTML, I suspect Typicorp's problem is even more prevalent today.Chapter 8 contains references to other places to go for more information and chapter 9 contains guidelines on how to know if your business could benefit from SGML. Chapter 9 also brings some common lessons learned together from the case studies and describes how to use these case studies to gage impact on your organization. That's it! The book is done and your boss is wiser. Many of the sticky questions that you would have had to face when presenting your business case have been answered. (See the three part business case article in the last three issues of &lt;TAG&gt;) Chet Ensign has made everyone's life easier who needs to sell SGML.

Looking at all the other reviews, the good and the bad, they are all basically right.As a naval officer with the designator responsible for aircraft acquisitions (although not personally involved, with the fleet instead) and a personal / professional interest in aircraft design this book aligns with my interests more than most any other. I expected a good history of exactly how the F/A-18 was developed, how the lightweight fighter competition went, how the acquisition process works, and a fair assessment of the actual F/A-18 fighter. What I got instead was the best history of all these things. I got the best history, because this is the only history of all of these things. And in an absolute since, although I think the topic is highly important and the data presented is very rare and thus invaluable, this is a very bad history. I actually agree with the author and the lightweight fighter mafia, but as one reviewer put it there's an argument for the lightweight fighter and this book isn't it. The author truly writes a confusing, sometimes deceptive, and way, way too cynical book that in the end feels more like a strange, biased hit piece on the F/A-18 plane rather than a balanced assessment of the acquisition process, how it can be reformed, and just how the F/A-18 development went.The Pentagon Paradox is basically that the more is promised of a plane (or any military system for that matter) the heavier, more complex it gets, the more it costs, and the less it actually performs. This is relatively well known and the book will convince you of it if you didn't know already. But the author just gets vindictive about it, seemingly taking out his anger on the subject of his book, instead of actually offering much real advice on how to reform the system. It's like kicking the cow for not lactating lemonade. By definition the current system is perfectly designed to produce exactly the results it produces. The acquisitions process does indeed sound like a nightmare in need of improvement. It involves huge sums of money, the careers of senior military officers and government officials, turf battles between the multiple bureaucracies and projects, and the politics associated with congressional oversight. As a result, in the budget battle, program advocates drastically overstate (i.e. lie) what they can deliver, unrealistic specifications are written, the system gets funked up in development in backwards attempts to meet those misguided specifications, too many people have a say in the development making it slower and worse because it tries to meet too many demands, and we do end up with systems that are relatively wasteful of taxpayer funds. But like Churchill said it's the worst system except for all others it would appear. The author weakly advocates more prototyping as a solution, and I agree, but doubt that this will solve the problem. Indeed it didn't, the F-16 and F/A-18 were both prototyped and this tome is mostly dedicated to ripping the F/A-18 to shreds. So where does that leave us? I don't think the author even realizes in the bigger picture he's writing against his own solution.There is a lot of good information in here about a lot of topics: air to air combat history, missile performance, air force doctrine, fighter design and performance, development of many different fighters, systems acquisition (especially the politics and bureaucratic infighting involved), the Gulf War, and the state of Naval aviation. A lot of this information simply isn't available elsewhere and thus I recommend this book for anyone whom would have professional interest in the above categories. I can barely scratch the surface here and so won't, do yourself a favor and buy the book.But a lot detracts from the book. The author is frequently whiny, confusing, and sometimes deceptive. He lionizes the lightweight fighter mafia perhaps too much, not critically evaluating anything they say. I agree with them mostly, but still think you should not grant them and their pronouncements God like and inviolate status the way he does Boyd, Pierre Sprey and Chuck Spinney. His presentation of facts is in depth and hugely detailed, but extremely spotty and selective; A huge amount of detail about some of the trees, not anywhere near enough on the forest. By cherry picking his trees he can paint a picture that while not untruthful, is not the whole truth either. One of the biggest standouts for me was the lack of any real comparison of just how the YF-16 and YF-17 performed in their fly-off for example. It also smacks of bias. Anything that can possibly be said bad about the F/A-18, whether they are mutually exclusive critiques or not, is presented as the truth. Basically nothing good is said of the plane. The F-16 on the other hand is always faultless.Despite being a book that suffers from many flaws this is an important book for many in the military and aerospace sectors to read and take to heart.End of my review.As an adjunct the lone one star review got challenged to back up his assertions of twisted logic and factual mis-representations. These bothered me too, so I compiled a list. Read on only if you're interested.- Despite a rather lengthy discussion about minutiae detail as to why the Navy rejected a Navalized F-16N, the factor of twin engine versus single engine is not brought up! Instead he spends most of the time claiming the Navy killed the F-16N based on a specious argument about its tail clearance angle. The F-16 features the same F-100 engine as used on the F-15. In another section of the book he disparages the low reliability of the F-100 engine and how acceptance flights of the F-15 experienced as high as a 15% failure rate for the engine. Although the F/A-18 is powered by a significantly more reliable F-404 engine the point is made. The lack of jet engine reliability coupled with blue water operations where rescue was unlikely in case of engine failure (and pointless in the North Atlantic Cold War battleground where the pilot would die from exposure within minutes of hitting the water anyway) was the primary reason the Navy wanted the actually slightly inferior performing but still highly capable twin engine YF-17 for its flight decks and not the otherwise superb single engine YF-16. In the event of a single engine failure the F/A-18 still has a decent chance of getting back to the ship, the F-16 has none and the pilot is likely lost too. This is the same reason that Canada, Finland, and Australia chose the F/A-18 over the F-16, all three countries have relatively vast wastelands which are difficult to perform search and rescue in and can easily kill downed aircrew if not rescued quickly. In a 389 page book with reams of notes and appendices the author doesn't even pay lip service to this primary reason the Navy chose the YF-17 but instead rips the decision for tens of pages citing secondary and tertiary issues only to make the Navy and the hornet look bad. The meticulously documented data of the tail clearance issue is an example of depth at the expense of breadth to a point that the much bigger picture is entirely missed. This was of course a decision of its time. The Navy had traditionally operated single engine aircraft, but there was a massive increased focus in safety and force preservation starting in the late 1950's which eventually drove the preference for twin engine Navy aircraft. Recently, improvements in engine reliability have allowed (some would say forced) the Navy to accept the single engine F-35, but not without uneasy reservations from many Naval Aviators.- He claims that all weather aircraft are not actually all weather aircraft because the number of sorties in the first Gulf War dropped with increasing cloud cover. This is the result of two things. First, and least importantly in this particular case, all weather does not mean that the aircraft can actually perform 100% of its jobs with 100% efficiency regardless of whether it's a clear sunny day or the inside of a hurricane on a moonless night. Even all weather aircraft will be reduced in efficiency in adverse weather (and pilots will certainly be hampered by it too, having to spread their concentration out over more factors, and thus system performance of plane + pilot will decrease because of the pilot), but they can operate in those types of weather as opposed to non all weather aircraft. Second, and more importantly here, allied doctrine dictated no operations below 10,000 feet since it wasn't felt necessary due to the danger posed by AAA and because we were fairly confident of overall military superiority, thus why risk pilot lives to engage enemy ground forces not in contact with our own? So when there was cloud cover below this floor the sorties were usually ineffective because they were constrained by doctrine, but not by the performance of the airplane. Yet the author happily and deceptively slides the blame to the aircraft.- Spends a large part of the book, rightly I think, describing the incredibly poor performance of the Sparrow missile in Vietnam and the reduction in fighter dogfighter performance associated with large radars and complex fire control avionics. Although he does this so repetitively throughout the book that it grows shrill and tiresome. In the same vein and often at the same time he disparages the F-14 (by no means a light weight fighter, much more it's antithesis) and the Phoenix missile, plus the NAVAIR bureaucrats who championed it. Later on though when the same pro F-14 bureaucrats, most likely defending their projects turf, testify before congress against the F/A-18 because of the Sparrow's inferiority to the Phoenix their treatment by the author shifts to heralded brainchildren behind the amazing F-14 who should know better than anyone else just how bad the hornet is. So the hornet is bad for having the Sparrow because it is heavy and complex, but it is also bad for not having the more complex and heavier Phoenix. The F-14 is also apparently able to out-dogfight the hornet all of the sudden, a claim made by the F-14 constituents at NAVAIR and one he gives validity to. But if this is true, that the heavy, complex and underpowered Tomcat can outdo a smaller, lighter, higher thrust to weight ratio and lower wing loading fighter in a dogfight, it is something that would invalidate his every argument for the lightweight fighter that he has built his entire book on. The common thread is criticism of the hornet, deserved or undeserved, not logical consistency.- He argues against any radar in a lightweight fighter other than a ranging radar for the pipper of the gun fire control system and a bare minimum of avionics. Later he blasts the F/A-18 though for lacking an additional avionics suite for its radar that would improve its air to surface mode, a radar he argued earlier it shouldn't even have in the first place.- He makes comparisons that are often incomparable and usually further cloud the issue. To continue his proof against all weather fighters he compares the total sorties generated by the allies in the winter months of WWII (with no all weather fighters) in 1944-45 to the total sorties flown in the Gulf War, and since more overall sorties were flown in WWII during a similar period (and in worse weather) than were flown during the Gulf War all weather fighters are thus bad and don't actually \\"buy you anything.\\" Comparing different wars is one thing, but in this case the basis of the comparison being total sortie generation rate is invalid. By the winter of 1944-45 the allies had been fighting for three to six years (depending on America or Britain respectively), were spending over 40% of their GDP on the war, had tens of thousands of planes, so on and so forth, conditions that amply contribute your ability to generate sorties and that didn't apply to the Gulf War. So what does it prove that more sorties were flown in WWII per month than in the Gulf War? Nothing. This isn't even comparing apples and oranges. But this false comparison is the basis for a whole extended argument against all weather fighters. At other points he literally compares how many B-17's we could buy for one F/A-18 (not including crew costs.) This is apparently because tonnage of bombs dropped is what counts and the tens of B-17's we could afford per hornet would thoroughly outclass the one F/A-18. I only mention crew costs, to say nothing of fuel costs, because these things would count in how many B-17's you really could afford to operate per hornet and would drastically skew his comparison. So his comparison is not just merely pointless, it is in fact inaccurate. Yet unsurprisingly it makes the hornet look bad again. He also talks about how many F-86's we could buy per F-15 at another point. There is a logical fallacy of many small steps that make sense individually (i.e. comparing one fighter to an earlier one, then comparing that earlier fighter to an earlier one, and so on and so forth to make a chain that you can eventually compare the first and last fighters against each other; only comparing non-deterministic systems like fighters is not commutative) but do not make sense taken together. For example, to go one or two steps further with the author's reasoning, do you realize how many Sopwith Camels we could afford per F/A-22 right now? Would our plentiful fleets of affordable lightweight Sopwith Camels clear the skies of enemy MiG-29's??- Because the F/A-18 \\"only\\" scored 2 of the 33 fixed wing air to air kills in the Gulf it was clearly a bad air to air fighter according to the author. This is his entire argument based on the combat results. But this is obviously not the whole story! How many F/A-18s were in the air versus F-15s, Tornadoes, F-16s, F-14s, Mirage 2000s, etc? How many of those F/A-18s were given the mission of and armed for shooting down enemy fighters, i.e. escort or Combat Air Patrol? (Next to none, those missions went to the F-15s, Tornadoes and F-14s, which sought the clear the MiGs before they could reach the hornets and falcons. The Hornets were bombing ground targets and not exactly going out of their way to down MiGs, the 2 MiG-21s the hornet did shoot down were while laden with tons of bombs and on their way to another target, a not un-impressive feat.) How many Iraqi aircraft came up to fight in the airspace where they would be in proximity to allied hornets? All of these are salient factors that are ignored. Worse, the F-16 (his championed plane as the model of what we should do) scored no air to air kills, so applying his own logic it must be an even worse air to air fighter, a claim he unsurprisingly doesn't make.- He compares the speed of the F/A-18 and the A-7 and comes away with the conclusion that there is no speed advantage to the F/A-18 when it is loaded with stores versus the A-7 and that therefore the clean max speed of the hornet is meaningless. I don't know the relative speeds (and he oddly doesn't actually state them himself either despite the fact that he has no problem providing reams of data in other situations) but I will grant him that it is true. But does his argument \\"miss the point?\\" I will put it this way, would a pilot who had just dropped a ton of bombs over a hostile target and thus alerted the enemy to his presence and intent which aircraft would he prefer to make his egress with, a clean configured F/A-18 with twin afterburning turbofans or a clean single engine, non afterburning A-7 that is well known to be slower in that \\"meaningless\\" configuration?- Although bogus comparisons between WWII and modern fighters are often made, there is amazingly very little comparison between the F/A-18 and contemporary fighters in a broad sense. Yes, the F/A-18 is compared to the F-14 in the interceptor role briefly (and on paper), as well as compared briefly again with the A-7 in the ground attack role (and again on paper), and as a multi-role fighter it comes up wanting. This is a valid argument against multi-role fighters and already well known, the old adage \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" immediately coming to mind. However there is a large amount of data of the F/A-18 did this or the F/A-18 did that, either in actual combat or testing, indicating that the results were poor, but not comparing how well the F-16 or other contemporary planes performed in testing or combat at the same missions, data that certainly exists. The lack of this data being presented can be ostensibly explained that this is a book about the F/A-18 and not the other planes. But it can just as easily be misleading. We don't know and his book thus conveys far less useful information and understanding than it could have. If little Johnny scores 45% on an Algebra test is he an idiot? If that's all that's mentioned most people would say yes. Well, how did the other kids do? Was the average 95%, or did the teacher write an incredibly difficult test and was the average 35%? Did the hornet perform poorly in combat because it didn't destroy every target it was assigned, or did the fog of war (Clausewitz's inexorable \\"friction\\") mean that most planes didn't perform perfectly or as advertised either? This comparison is left out, and the silence is deafening. In fairness to the author though I feel compelled to point out that he does actually do a good job of talking about one plane, the A-10, which certainly did perform well in the Gulf War and makes a convincing case for it.- On Page 270 he shows that in the Gulf War it took on average 72 sorties to destroy a bridge, and thus claims a completely ridiculous 1.5% sortie success rate, clearly meant to imply poor weapon systems performance. But this is deceptive in the extreme and assumes that each sortie was defined as some lone warrior plane sent up with the intent and capability of destroying the bridge all by itself, that it should have destroyed the bridge all by itself, and that it took 72 tries to destroy the bridge for a 1.38% (1 divided by 72, rounded up to 1.5%) success rate. In reality the strike package against a bridge would consist of multiple aircraft designated to actually strike the bridge in order to make sure the thing went down and without the need for a second strike package. Included in this package would be the nucleus of strike aircraft for actually hitting the bridge, fighter escort to protect the whole package, possibly SEAD aircraft to engage enemy SAM and AAA and clear the air defenses ahead of the strikers, AWACS assets to give the strike package situational awareness and provide control, reconnaissance aircraft to follow up the strike and provide Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) plus tankers for the whole package and can thus easily approach dozens of aircraft. This is not bad aircraft design (in fact the author prefers and argues for single role aircraft!) or poor system performance but it just is what is necessary to drop a bridge, protect yourself, and evaluate if you actually did it. To report this fact in a completely misleading and incorrect way to imply poor combat performance of weapons systems furrows eyebrows as to exactly what the author's point is.- Read Page 297 for a good example of having it both ways. At first the author talks about how completely and utterly ineffective the Gulf War air campaign was, citing only one point of information in a vast ocean of data as opposed to any overview or summary data to show the whole picture. (Although the air campaign was not that effective compared to the ground campaign somewhere in his gloomy analysis of how poorly the military and its equipment worked during the Gulf War is also the minor detail that we actually won the war with less than 200 combat fatalities.) But apparently this completely incompetent bombing campaign is also blamed for somehow destroying Iraqi healthcare and the food supply, which weren't even targets, and more amazingly doing so after the war was over. Quoting verbatim from that page: \\"Yet as reported in Aviation Week & Space Technology, at one location, 'only 10 of 100 oil storage tanks were destroyed, and postwar Iraqi fuel supplies are so great that gasoline is still cheap' . . . some of the strategic bombing accomplished nothing more than the postwar demise of health and food services for the civilian population.\\" Or could it be that after the Shia uprising at the end of the war Saddam denied food and adequate medical care to suppress his enemies, which is the normal explanation of any starving group most anywhere on the planet. We don't actually lack food, but around the world we do have people in power willing to starve their enemies. This is not some bizarre after-effect of what the author would have you believe is a bungling air war that couldn't tie it's own shoes. It was the policy of Saddam Hussein. But why bother putting that blame on him when it could just as easily (and inaccurately) be laid at the feet of the US military, the equipment it buys, and the way it buys it? The author does the latter, disingenously in my opinion.- After explaining away the Gulf War victory as Pierre Sprey did as a complete collapse of Iraqi morale due to being exhausted after the Iran-Iraq war and thus not really an allied victory in one chapter, he later castigates the development of the F/A-18E/F in the next by asking, if we won the Gulf War against the fourth largest military in the world with the original hornet what's the more \\"potent potential threat\\" out there than the Iraqi military was in 1991 to justify an upgraded hornet? Well, China for one, but by his own reasoning one day practically any military, North Korean, Iranian, Chinese, or otherwise, would be more potent than Iraq's in 1991, argued in order to deny a successful victory to allied forces, but when it suits his purposes to extol the vaunted and vast Iraqi military in order to deny the ostensible purpose or justification Super Hornet the next day he does so without blinking an eye. All these things made it very hard for me to accept what the author says on face value."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"First off Mr. Stevenson has a very big axe to grind and he does it with this book. If you can put that out of your head when you read this and understand it for what it is. That is how, by using the F-18 Hornet as an example, the Pentagon wants to buy simple but so many people put so much into what that item needs to do that it become so costly and overbudget that it is cheaper to continue to fund it and buy it then it is to trash it and start again. This book is dated to a point in that it was written just after the First Gulf War. But the ideas covered in how the Pentagon fails to buy its weapons right is still true. The biggest part of the axe to grind is about half way through the book when the reader finds out that Mr. Stevenson was very involved with this project as an Undersecretary in the late 70's going into the early 80's. So he knows to a point how some of the bitter congressional fighting went. He also finds a way to bite back as some of the (at the time) current Defense personnel that stood in his way. If you can over look this axe then this is a very good book. When added with how he has recently written about the A-12 Avenger II fiasco it does well as to provided some ideas on how to fix the purchasing of new weapons sytems and platforms."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"\\"The Pentagon Paradox\\", subtitled \\"The Development of the F-18 Hornet\\", goes beyond that, describing how our military wastes money on equipment paradoxically overpriced and underperforming. Not the most expensive or least efficient of America's warplanes, the F-18 stands out because it was intended to reverse the trend towards expensive and complicated planes, but ultimately became that kind of plane.James Stevenson's book is almost immediately partisan - he's got strong opinions about the shared Air Force and Navy addiction for aircraft needlessly sophisticated and too expensive to procure in reasonable number. Paradox begins in during the Viet Nam war, when we learned the bitter lesson of technology's limits. Despite the poor performance of the F-4- easily the world's most sophisticated fighter- both services commit millions to develop even more sophisticated successors. Instead of the USAF F-15 or the Navy's Tomcat, a cadre of officers known as \\"The Lightweight Fighter Mafia\\" press for a small low-cost fighter that can be built and maintained in large numbers while still preserving our technological edge. By 1977, ACEVAL/AIMEVAL exercises firmly demonstrate weaknesses in America's new warplanes. Knowing that they will never be rid of these expensive new jets, the Light-Mafia push for a light-weight fighter to \\"compliment\\" them.The eventual result is the \\"lightweight fighter competition\\" between the GD YF-16 and the Northrop YF-17, designed to select the LWF for the USAF and the Navy with the apparent intention of selecting the same plane for both services. In hindsight, given bitter inter-service rivalry, a smarter course would have been to have both services evaluate each aircraft in parallel. Instead, the USAF gets the first pick, leaving the Navy with the unenviable choice or either a \\"navalized\\" version of a rival service's choice or the loser of the competition. While the Navy's dilemma may sound more unpalatable than impenetrable (what's so bad about shipping out with carrier-ready F-16's? The USAF accepted versions of the Navy's Phantom and managed to do quite nicely), the title \\"Paradox\\" says it all. The Navy went out of its way to choose the loser and has been trying to hide the fact of its cost ever since. Stevenson shows how the Navy bent its own rules to make the F-18 carrier-ready - using double standards in such areas as landing speed, range, weight and \\"spotting factor\\" (which measures how much space an airplane will occupy while on a carrier deck) which should have given the F-16 the edge. The Hornet is so unsuitable that, according to a study cited by Stevenson, it would have cost us more to select it for both services than both selecting the F-16 for the USAF and developing a new plane for the Navy.The story doesn't end with the Hornet. Instead, the Navy will then spend billions in the early 1990's on a new Hornet, the F-18E. In some ways, the F-18E is simply a radical modification of older Hornets - visually similar, 90% common avionics, with marginal improvements in weight, range and maneuverability. In terms of actual structural differences (a redesigned wing and other control surfaces and new engine) but mostly because of the billions spent developing it, the \\"Super Hornet\\" is an entirely new airplane. Unsurprisingly, the Navy and the Defense Department prefer to characterize the F-18E as a modification because this will allow the program to bypass many procedural hurdles de rigueur for a totally new airplane, even though it will cost more to \\"modify\\" the Hornet than it did to create it.\\"Pentagon Paradox\\" is ambitious - the F-18 is only part of that story in which our military stridently campaigns for weapons it doesn't need, paid for with money it can't spare. Besides the Hornet, Stevenson also tells of the airplane it was meant to \\"compliment\\" - the too-expensive F-14, an airplane that also benefited from selective bending of rules. (The Navy acquired the F-14 after rejecting a navalized version of the F-111 deemed unsuitable for carrier aviation. Stevenson shows how the Navy F-111 exceeded its parameters no more egregiously than the Tomcat.) The USAF doesn't get off lightly either - they choose the F-16, but can't make too strong a case for the small fighter lest it endanger the F-15. Eventually, the F-16 also succumbs to the \\"Pentagon Paradox\\", becoming an overweight, high-priced warplane with more sophisticated weaponry than needed. Stevenson also attacks the logic of stand-off missiles like the Sparrow, the reason-de-etre of sophisticated fighters like the F-15 and the Hornet. Sparrows were notorious heartbreakers in Viet Nam. Eventually tweaked to reliability, the Sparrow will never make beyond-visual-range intercept a reality, and all successful kills are made within the same range as shorter-ranged Sidewinder. Sparrow is a big player in the Hornet's story, because the Navy's insistence on Sparrow capability for the F-18 belies its role as a practical and economical aircraft.But Stevenson goes beyond the Hornet - he also covers the many undisclosed technical blunders of Desert Storm, and reveals the hollow promise of exclusive airpower in other past wars. In his painful deconstruction of airpower, Stevenson harks to names like Pierre Spey, air combat visionary John \\"forty-second\\" Boyd and defense analyst Chuck Spinney, all attacking the military's single-minded obsession with big and heavy warplanes from different angles. Stevenson also covers the almost mind-numbing bureaucratic and political maneuvering that shaped our current generation of tactical fighters (and also shaped a number of paper projects that never survived the planning stages). At times, Stevenson nearly succumbs to the Paradox himself, and there are stretches that are nigh unreadable as he navigates the bureaucratic and political morass of defense acquisitions. Stevenson also tends to inject more cynicism than necessary. (As an aviation analyst, was he really that shocked to learn how unrealistic the F-15's stated specs are?) That said, Stevenson's work is heavily footnoted (perhaps excessively so - but at least he's got research to back him up, and we never doubt that he stands by what he says). \\"Paradox\\" may be inaccurate, but it is incendiary, compulsively readable and it deserves an answer."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"As a former military officer, I was curious about this book upon hearing about it from a friend in the Naval aviation community. I have seen factual evidence of this kind of procurement first hand. In fairness, all branches do it. The Army bought off on a very substandard Bradley (quasi-armored) for political reasons, for example. As I have no way of researching Stenvenson's facts, I keep an open mind but gauge that against my personal military experiences. After reading this book, I have to admit allegiance to the lightweight fighter mafia. America cannot afford 50-90 million dollar hyper complex fighters in limited numbers against aggressive factions that possess superior numeric air forces. I believe that the military should invest in a reality check as to where our dollars are being thrown. The quote \\"Where is Naval Aviation going?\\" really deserves in-depth consideration. Careers in the upper military ranks are being bolstered by people manuevering for political and monetary gain shamefuly at putting the lower ranks and our country at risk. Between the aerospace industry, the lobbyists, and the obscene amount of money involved, it shouldn't come as a shock that politics and corruption are rampant. I enjoyed the book and have already made multiple recommendations to other military officers and friends in the V-22 Osprey community."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"This book takes an indepth look at the F-18 history. But it does not assume that what the Department of Defense or the U.S. Navy claims is necessary true.The book gives a behind the scenes look at what really happened with the F-18 and how it became an aircraft less than it could have been.Anyone who wants to feel good about the F-18 should avoid reading this book. This tome is for those looking for what really happened and want a basis for understanding the process by which the military provides systems that often fall far short of their claims."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"James Stevenson does an excellent job of not only showing how the Pentagon is just another government bureaucracy which squanders taxpayers money but also shows how the US Navy deliberately chose to procure an aircraft they knew was inferior mainly because they didn't want the hated US Air Force dictating what aircraft the Navy should fly. Shows the ugly corruption that places interservice rivalry and favored defense contractors ahead of America's security. Every elected official and concerned taxpayer should read this and see the dark underbelly of America's military."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"Interesting but biased. Simply put, Stevenson does not like Hornets. He uses any contradictory or circular argument he can to try to convince the reader that the procurement of the F-18 (he refuses to use F/A-18) was a horrid mistake. Given today's Navy's almost exclusive reliance on the Hornet and its progeny, the Super Hornet, his arguments on its percieved worthlessness, written in the early 90's, come off as laughable. Still if you are obsessed with the Hornet or the inner workings of military procurement, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"Disclosure: I read this book after reading Coram's biography of John Boyd. I more or less knew what to expect, and was somewhat disappointed. (The buffs will find more connections between the two books than it would appear at first. For example, we find out who was the aircraft designer whose magical airplane had negative drag at zero speed).The Pentagon is a mess. This massively, grotesquely over-bloated temple of bureaucracy manages to waste somewhere between 600 billion and one trillion dollars a year, depending on what you count. The entire rest of the world doesn't spend the latter sum. Nobody in his right mind can deny the evidence: military affairs are defined by a lack of transparency, accountability, and plain morality. Almost everybody who is connected to the military-industrial-congressional complex will have to lie hard and often. If he doesn't, he will be criticized, marginalized, and possibly expelled from the system. Virtually always, threats are exaggerated or simply made up, citizens are misled, and weapons programs end up costing far more than expected. So-called budget cuts happen to be cuts in the expected rate of growth of military expenditures. It's an utterly rotten, corrupt world.The question is, how successful is Stevenson at portraying these facts?The answer is, not much. Somehow, the writing just lacks the force I find in Coram's book, or in anything written by Everest Riccioni or Pierre Sprey. He goes over the facts calmly, and by the time he reaches a conclusion, the reader has already figured out, so there isn't much emotion to the reading. No doubt, there is anger behind the words, but Stevenson just doesn't write very well so he can't make the readers feel outraged or anything.He also spends a lot of time reaching conclusions and speculating about far-flung marcial affairs, such as what was the effectiveness rate of JDAMs in the Gulf War and so on. But the point of this book is not military history, or war in general. The point is politics and governance. The BVR vs WVR debate, for example, could take several books on its own and can't be discussed in deep at the same time as so many other issues. It would be enough with saying that BVR was a persistent disappointment and did not change the face of war. You get that? You do not need to bash the Sparrow missile over and over. Yes, we get the vast majority of Sparrows were used in WVR kills, it's not necessary to repeat it.And besides, nnot many people will be interested in this book because they want to find out how many BVR kills took place in the air battle over Lebanon, 1982. (Nugget: it was only 1 out of 80, and the Israelis had F-15s and E-2s so there's no excuse). By contrast, most people will be interested in this book because they want to know if their dollars are actually being used for a decent purpose. Because they want to know if the generals and politicians are telling the truth. No, they aren't.So why 4 stars? Because many of the facts told in this book can't be found anywhere else. Or if they can, they are in separate little pieces, in obscure columns by retired Reformers who reminisce about their past. The author has really done his homework in that respect. Stevenson is the only one who has not only made the effort to weave a narrative around the F-18, but has actually had the guts to put out a book. Many people complain about \\"problems\\" in the military and publish the occasional article, but articles are soon forgotten. Books mark your career forever.Riccioni, Sprey, Stevenson and Boyd have made their case against military bloat. It's something of a vindication to see the F-22 cancelled. But if you want to find out just how utterly pointless, useless these budgets are, there are two books I have to recommend: Quiet cataclysm and Retrat from doomsday, both by John Mueller.They are absolutely the best books I've read on modern war and politics. As it turns out, nobody is willing to invade anybody, let alone America...so what use is the Pentagon?"},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. As a former Naval Officer charged with building/maintaining the infrastructure Naval Aviation uses coupled with my engineering background I find the historical aspects of Naval aviation to be a very interesting topic.While in the Navy I also became a Level II (Level III is where the big money is spent) contract officer which accorded me first hand experience of the acquisition process. I can relate the the issues and concerns which the author alluded to with procurement. What the author does not talk about is the issue of time which in major acqusitions is usually long. Time appears to be a major issue in the Navy's reluctance to prototype the F/A18E/F. Given the issues the Navy was having with the F-14 in the late '90's I'm not surprised that NAVAIR pushed the E/F Rhino through. Did the Navy really have an alternative? Especially for the F/A-18F. No more Tomcat, no more Intruder; what does the Carrier task force have left for power projection?Overall I found the book to be laced with facts and statistics which was enjoyable. I found the book lacking on conclusions and/or reccomendations. I can see how people have issues with the book but I can say I did not find the author making the same conclusions in some of the other reviews. I read the book rather fast (2 days) and probably need to read it again.Since I left the Navy and now work in a fortune 200 company, I can tell you that the issues we faced in the Navy are very similar to those faced by corporate America. Big projects suffer from scope creap and also seldom meet the requirements/needs for which they were approved. Individuals make careers on getting them completed and supporting the completion of the project regardless if it really works. I offer for reference any ERP project at a fortune 200 firm. But is that the point of the book?I can say after reading this book that I am much less a fan of the F-15 and F-14. I was never a fan of the F-18 only because of the \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" philosophy. I would have enjoyed this book much more if the author took about 10 pages to write up his conclusions and then add a chapter which would allow for his perspective of what a Naval Air wing should look like. I found myself wanting for concusions or better yet, a specific point to the book. What should I learn from this book?That said I would reccomend this book to people who are:1. Interested in the development of modern fighter aircraft2. Interested in interservice rivalry challenges3. Interested in understanding inertia against change in large beauracraciesI would not reccomend this book to people who are:1. Interested in making a case for the F-18, F-15 nor F-142. Interested in getting insights to improving the procurement process3. Interested in debating issues/solutions facing our naval aviators and NAVAIR Strategy.If you are interested in modern aviation, this is a good read.My favorite quote: \\"Analysts are seen just above traitors...\\""},{"Title":"The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet","review":"The author argues forcibly for the case of lightweight fighters, and tells the story of the development of the F/A-18 and F/A-18E.

What I found out was far beyond what I expected. Basically, the author tries to analyze the historical existence of Jesus. Many have attempted that before, but his perspective is indeed both innovative and unique. In fact, the author proves (however using circumstantial evidence) that the Gospels and the scripts left by Paul were based on a &quot;lost&quot; bible which he tries to prove existed (mainly comparing the texts in the Gospels and other Christian resources). What impressed me was the author's usage of Aramaic (the language Jesus is believed to have spoken) as well as Arabic, Hebrew and Greek. The author's main argument is based on the question: Why did Paul go to Arabia rather than Jerusalem following his revelation. Indeed, this remains a most interesting question which the book attempts to resolve. As a critical researcher, I find his work convincing as well as interesting (but not necessarily convincing all the way through). Yet, since Salibi has pursued an innovative scientific' approach in this study, I now find myself seeking two other controversial books of his, both he argues have furnished the writing of &quot;Conspiracy in Jerusalem&quot;, namely &quot;Secrets of the Bible People&quot; and &quot;The Bible Came from Arabia&quot;. Salibi warns, however, both at the beginning and end of his book that if one is looking for a religious scandal, &quot;Conspiracy in Jerusalem&quot; is not the kind book he should be looking for. Bourdillon's words &quot;The mind has a thousand eyes and the heart but one&quot; are most appropriate in identifying Salibi's work, but one indeed needs not to have his faith in question before he starts reading the first book. A most remarkable and insightful work by all means."},{"Title":"Who Was Jesus?: A Conspiracy in Jerusalem","review":"With absolute confidence, Kamal Salibi presents solid evidence in order to argue that Christianity as we know it, is the brainchild of Paul the Apostle, and is way different from the main teachings of Jesus, whom Paul never met but claimed to have seen in a revelation.The book is based on Salibi's original hypothesis of his book The Bible Came from Arabia.Who Was Jesus starts with a description of the soiopolitical status quo of the Jewish kingdoms of Judea and Israel prior to the arrival of Jesus. Salibi draws historical parallels and argues that Jesus, coming from a royal Jewish line in Arabia, the seat of Jewish historic events, came to Palestine to lay claim over his sovereignty over the Jewish people. He said that by the time of Jesus, Jews had considerably emmigrated from Arabia and established a prosperous community in Palestine.Jesus' bid, however, disturbed the status quo of the Jewish establishment and made the influential among them demand that the Romans crucify him.Not aware at first of the original story, Paul started preaching his line of Christianity, which eventually made him fall out with the rest of Jesus' closest followers. Salibi concludes that Paul's version of Christianity ultimately prevailed and contributed to shaping the religion in the way that we know it today."},{"Title":"Who Was Jesus?: A Conspiracy in Jerusalem","review":"Dr. Kamal Salibi delivers, again, a gem. This daring analysis of what might have been the true history of Jesus is very enlightening. He draws on his extensive knowledge and superb analytical skills, coupled with relentless research to explain and draw a new light to what everyone have taken for granted about Jesus.This historical scenario is very daring, since it clashes with the accepted beliefs. It represents stories that have been suppressed for centuries, and clarifies the contradictions encountered in the accepted version of the New Testament. The book states that the story of Jesus might be the story of 3 personalities that were eventually combined into one. This book must be read."},{"Title":"Who Was Jesus?: A Conspiracy in Jerusalem","review":"It is a must read esp. if you were familiar with his other books about the bible. It is very well written."},{"Title":"Who Was Jesus?: A Conspiracy in Jerusalem","review":"Before commenting the book I start my review with KAMAL SALIBI biography in order to show his education and cultural environments.For those who do not know him, Kamal SALIBI is one of the greatest Arab scholars. Recently (2003) he published his autobiography that includes parts of the modern cosmopolitan Lebanese history and where he tells some stories of the American protestant and Methodist missions in Lebanon during the period 19th -20th century, since he was one of their students starting his primary education till his graduate studies.While reading his autobiography you meet public modern figures from Bahrain and Kuwait who were his colleagues at the American university of Beirut. He takes us to London during Second World War. In London one meets Bernard Lewis who was his supervisor in his studies. Kamal Salibi is also an Arab and an Arab cultured person. He is a Christian who got the influences of both historical eastern orthodox and modern Christianity as viewed by American Methodist and protestant churches.Unlike other biblical scholars KAMAL SALIBI worked on a lot of projects related to lot of Arab countries; projects ranging in space and time and topic; from cities dictionaries to old words of eastern Arabia. Recently he has been working, and still on the dialogue between religions.For kamal SALIBI we cannot watch history of Palestine out of its real context in the geographical and historical means.Unintentionally he applies what he knows and what he has touched through his life education and carrier.According to this man all these issues ( bible, jesus , etc..) belong to the same content of cultures. babiloniya , Eastern Arabia, Palestine, Gulf of Oman have most of their stories details belonging to the common containers. For SALIBI, as for other Arab scholars [example: Fadel -Al-roubai3i] ( 3= the Letter ain in both Arabic and old CANANEEN scripts) the old Arabian oral traditions besides the Syrian and Palestinian ones compose a whole with multitude of versions and mutations. In this, indirectly, he meets with Thomas L. Thompson in his view of scriptures. This has lead him to other results; a geographical displacement. For Thompson this was not necessary.These mutations go deeper than simple linguistic approaches. In his last autobiography he shows an example of discussion with western scholars for topics cited in southern YEMEN and coastal Phoenicia.SALIBI wrote this book - about Jesus - in this context. Unfortunately the works of Fadel -al-rabi3i are not yet translated to English. His last book \\"Sisters of Quraish\\" published in Beirut shows lot of common roots and aphorisms to be compared to the bible details. The difference with the case of Judea area in Palestine was the canonization and fixing of these later traditions following the Greek models of fixation in the case of the bible. If some reader follows the details examples of names, food, marriage, drinks cited in oral Arab tradition he will not be surprised by the ideas of KAMAL SALIBI towards historicity of Jesus, regardless of whether it is true or false.Following I give some examples used by KAMAL SALIBI in this book - that I read some years ago - : QURAN, taken as a literary book of the 7th century CE, describes Jesus as named 3issa while in the Arab language Jesus is Yesou3 or Yasou3. Christians are called NASSARA and not masi7iyeen. 3issa is from AHARONIC descendant and not Davidic. Mary mother of 3issa has delivered the baby near a palm tree. Also following QURAN Jews [ following of a religion ] [ YAHOUD] have different features compared to BANI-ISRAIIL [ Sons of Israel ] who were a people from old times similar to the people of MEDIYAN or 3ad. These examples proclaimed by QURAN were not shocking for the persons of Arabia of the period of the QURAN. In other words there was a different version, not only one, talking of all this stuff. Islam has fixed this and The \\"New\\" world history made of islam another religion.Beyond Quran, SALIBI reviews Pauline documents, reanalyze gospels sources, he adds the Injil source cited in quran to the traditional views of scholars about the gospels. Among other points he focuses on why the historical Jesus is not the main in pauline document.Jesus the \\"nassorei\\" is a historical figure; true. His objective was rather political than religious. Himself was follower of an israelite ( not jewish) sect that has its roots - out of Palestine - ( why not - do the reader know that some jewish tribes of Arabia - quranic times - have arabian roots and not palestinian.! )Other examples cited by SALIBI are the oral stories that are still current till our era [ yes 20th century CE ] or fixed through Arabic historians of the Islamic periods, to express El-3iss God and its relation with the fecundity and moon tradition.Away from SALIBI another Spanish modern author speaks of pre-Islamic religions not following the Hellenistic-Roman model that had ARIUS (4th century CE ) among its scholars.Here is nothing of a plot or modern conspiracy as reviewed by one reviewer. Here, with this book, is simply a wider approach not usual for the western reader who is used to millenistic scenarios that has the east most limits of the world geography located on the east coast of Jordan river."},{"Title":"Who Was Jesus?: A Conspiracy in Jerusalem","review":"Regardless of your belief, the book reads like a detective novel.

Both parties speak out their minds in total bias hanging on to their beliefs and refusing to admitt to new ideas.

Those who will be most impressed, however, are the Hebrew speakers who know Arabic or the Arabic speakers who know Hebrew. Unfortunately you will find a handful of those dual-language semitic speakers.

I guess that's the whole point. However the majority of the kitchens in this book require custom cabinetry. If you can do that yourself, you're in luck and this book is for you. However if you do not have a $30k budget for cabinetry to store your food and dishes then this book will do little to help you design your kitchen. The kitchens shown are mostly huge with a few exceptions and even the exceptions are using tens of thousands of dollars of custom cabinetry. If all you need are ideas of what is possible, browse through this book in a library or bookstore. If you need real life examples of what can be done with a small to medium size kitchen on the same size budget, forget this book. It won't help."},{"Title":"The Art of Kitchen Design: Planning for Comfort and Style","review":"Designing a kitchen is an excruciating task for most homeowners. The restrained and often stale design palette of most kitchen designers compounds the difficulty. Far too many &quot;dream kitchens&quot; are nothing more than expensive appliances attached to row upon horizontal row of bland cabinets and continuous work surfaces. Not only is this is esthetically uninteresting, but these modern designs are often not fully functional and detract from the spatial beauty of older homes. John Grey dares to be different. While decidedly modern in material choice and functionality, his kitchens evoke the flavor and visual beauty of older kitchens. The book is superbly illustrated with examples of his work. Mr. Grey's book is a passionate treatise on how to create a stunning yet fully functional kitchen interior. His ideas are provocative, among them a banishment of upper cabinets and a mixing of lower cabinet styles and height. The book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book, it has scale drawings and colour pictures, but its focus is on the principles and not the particulars of kitchen remodelling. The audience of this book will be those who desire something different and special in a kitchen. It is an essential read for anyone planning a kitchen remodel and is of particular importance to those who have older homes."},{"Title":"The Art of Kitchen Design: Planning for Comfort and Style","review":"I am a professional cabinetmaker and designer. Johnny Grey's book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about and designing kitchens for the way we use them in our modern lifestyles. It is easily the most inspirational book I have ever seen on the subject. I fully recommend this book to anyone in the trade wanting to take a fresh look at their craft.In general, cabinetry from the big mass manufacturers are inadequate to fulfill Johnn'y ideas, because his whole design philosophy represents a new paradigm not yet integrated into our general culture. Therefore I do not recommend this book to the average homeowner wanting to remodel their kitchen unless they have a reasonable budget and can think creatively. And oh, yes, you are willing to establish a working relationship with an open minded cabinet maker skilled at custom design as well!"},{"Title":"Once a Marine: The Memoirs of General A. A. Vandegrift Commandant of the U.S. Marines in WW II","review":"\\"Once A Marine,\\" the engaging memoirs of Alexander A. Vandegrift - eighteenth Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, is a remarkable story. The story is that of a leader who dedicated forty years of his life in service to his country, his Corps, and his fellow Marines. He did it all with personal humility and without losing perspective of the Corps' role in American government and society. This book is an important part of any World War II or Marine Corps collection.This book illustrates General Vandegrift's belief in the importance of communication, as dozens of his letters to family, friends, leaders, and fellow servicemen are included. Also included are selections from his many speeches, including the famous \\"bended knee\\" speech that he gave before Congress to state the convincing case for the very existence of the Marine Corps.Told here is the story of Vandegrift's career, which truly spanned the globe, with service in Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, China, Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and American locations such as Maine, North Carolina, and Washington, DC. Throughout many actions and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, he relates his extensive service under larger-than-life figures such as Smedley Butler, Thomas Holcomb, Douglas MacArthur, Chester Nimitz, and William Halsey. Also, we learn that in Vandegrift's Pacific actions and campaigns, he led other Marines who would become legends in their own rights - Clifton Cates, Merritt Edson, Joe Foss, Roy Geiger, Herman Hanneken, Randolph Pate, Lewis Puller, Lemuel Sheppard, David Shoup, Julian Smith, and Holland Smith. Five of these Marines would go on to become Commandants themselves.Vandegrift led the 1st Marine Division in its successful invasion of Guadalcanal, which was the first American offensive action in the Pacific Theater during World War II. This book gives an extensive narration of the invasion for which he ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor. Throughout his career, Vandegrift continued to break new ground. As Commandant, he was the first Marine four-star general on active duty.In a large downtown park in my city, there is a monument dedicated to Marines fallen in combat. General Vandegrift was present and dedicated the monument on November 11th, 1947. From reading this book, I learned that in Washington, DC Vandegrift had named his successor only the day before, on November 10th - the 172nd birthday of the Marine Corps. The fall of 1947 also saw Vandegrift and the Corps emerge successful from the final round of a multiyear struggle for the continuation of the Marine Corps as a separate and distinct service. Vandegrift's dedication, honesty, humility, and foresight for the future of the Corps lead the way in this momentous struggle.It is often said that Marines do not leave their dead behind. As General Alexander A. Vandegrift, in the twilight of his career, stood at the monument to fallen brothers-in-arms on that rainy November day, he proved that saying to be right. After reading this book, you will know the character that makes up such a great leader."},{"Title":"Once a Marine: The Memoirs of General A. A. Vandegrift Commandant of the U.S. Marines in WW II","review":"No student of Marine Corps history should be without a copy of this book. It's an oldie, and of course it's a memoir, so the tone is very much personal and the viewpoint is unique to General Vandegrift. But the value of his observations, personal experiences with the superstars of 20th Century Warfare, and his unaffected manner of relating the facts of battle are worth immersing yourself in."},{"Title":"Once a Marine: The Memoirs of General A. A. Vandegrift Commandant of the U.S. Marines in WW II","review":"This book was written at a level that is easy for anyone to fully understand. It gives an insight of General Vandegrift's earlier life as a boy, and then as a young Marine during World War I in order for the reader to acquire a sense of connection with him as he is tasked to develop the First Marine Division and then deploy with it as the Commanding General during the campaign to defeat the Japanese at Guadalcanal and then other Solomon Island campaigns. The book is absolutely captivating in its construction to put the reader right there in the thick of battle with the general. Vandegrift identifies how he had to elucidate with Army Generals and Navy Admirals on how desperate the battle of Guadalcanal was, finally attracting the favorable attention of Admirals Nimitz and Halsey which resulted in him receiving the necessary support in order to win the fight and later to get his division a satisfactory location in order to rest and recover from that hellish struggle with the Japanese. He is promoted to the challenge of Commandant of the Marine Corps after the Solomon Islands are in allied control, and gives a gripping explanation of how he labored to obtain necessary weapons and logistical support for the Marines. Finally at the end of the war he explains how he went about preserving the Marine Corps when the President Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were posturing to disband this outstanding military organization. This biography is a must read for aspiring Marines of every rank and history buffs."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","review":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Goodbye...This selection is a favorite especially for teachers.

And there was a possible upside: Israel might thereby rid itself of a security liability and isolate its remaining enemies.The peace idealists, on the other hand, simply bought the most preposterous and transparent lies of thugs such as Arafat, hook, line, and sinker. It is hard to believe that anyone could be so naive as not to be at least a little more suspicious, but in this article, Gidron shows us that some folks were that naive, including him.Until September 2000, that is, when it all fell apart, and Arafat started a war against the very people who had, um, \\"morally cleansed\\" him.I have to admit that I have little sympathy for many of the peace idealists. I like the idea of peace. But I can see that surrender to thugs is not the answer. For one thing, it isn't peace. It is a war in which one has put down one's weapons but one's enemies have kept their weapons, and that is quite the opposite of peace. Still, my complaint with the peace idealists is not primarily about their being too naive. It is about the countless times that many of them have refused to take truth seriously and refused to think about logical inconsistencies in their stances. No matter what one tries to do, if one plunges ahead and ignores all facts and logic, one will fare poorly.Well, what does the author conclude? He lets himself off the hook as being naive. And so he lets those who took the same position off the hook. That may be self-serving. But just what hook does he let himself off? It's the hook of being guilty of complicity in political crimes. That's a pretty big hook.As for those who stayed in the camp of the peace idealists even after September, 2000, well, to Gidron they are indeed guilty of political crimes. And I have to agree. Those \\"who continue to make excuses for political murder\\" have indeed crossed the line.I recommend this article."},{"Title":"Escape from Babel: Toward a Unifying Language for Psychotherapy Practice (Norton Professional Books)","review":"I am especially glad to have stumbled upon Escape From Babel sooner rather than later in my career.

The story concerns the escalating problems that beset a typical Australian 'bludger' (lazy type), his immature 18 year old son and his silly brother in-law, when the man's wife leaves him, having been encouraged to do so by her venomous sister and sniffly mother.It is a fun read, although perhaps getting slightly dated now and a bit mysoginistic.It is faintly reminiscent of the escalating humour of 'The Adventures of Barrie McKenzie' (an Australian comic strip by Barrie Humprhires (Dame Edna Everidge) and turned into a film by Bruce Beresford in the mid 70's) and also perhaps Crocodile Dundee because of its colloquial Australian flavour and euphimisms.It is now out of print but Angus and Robertson (Syndey, Melbourne, London and Wellington) may know where copies lie."},{"Title":"Here's luck","review":"An uncle known for his eccentric taste in gifts gave this to me when I was about 11, so it naturally lay unread for years. Definitely my loss, as the pithy one-liners alone make it a joy to read again and again. Virtually every page is a comic gem, but I can't decide whether Jack's attempted reconciliation with his wife (and subsequent unfortunate confrontation with his mother-in law and sister in-law), or the passionate tribute to alcohol by Mr Sloove (aspiring MP) is the highlight of the book - perhaps both?"},{"Title":"Here's luck","review":"This riotously funny book is also consistently surprising. Just when you think you have the rhythm of the humor down pat, Lennie Lower strikes a different path. Ostensibly, this is a rowdy book about a hard-drinking, somewhat misogynist Aussie good old boy and his ne'er-do-well son, who -- suddenly freed of any female oversight -- gamble, tussle, smoke and drink to glorious excess. It's a kind of a road story where the characters never go anywhere, and appear dangerously close to self-destruction at every turn. You would expect the writing to be curt and fairly coarse -- yet it's also subtle, exceedingly well-turned, consistently delightful. Mark Twain is cited in the introduction as a reference point, but Damon Runyon seems fair too, and I kept thinking about Kingsley Amis as well.Before I even finished the book, I had sent copies to two people. It's that kind of book -- a surprise to anyone not reared among kangaroos and waltzing Mathilda. Read it and discover a dazzling comic voice. One of the best of the excellent Prion Humour Classics."},{"Title":"Here's luck","review":"It is a crying shame for Australian literature that Lennie Lower wrote but one novel in his lifetime 'Here's Luck'. However at the same time as we lament the lack of a more volumous collection of work, let us be thankful that the hard drinking, hard talking Lower found time to chip in with this sweet reminder of Australia leading up to the depression era of the 1930s.The book comprises of a short timespan in the life of Jack Gudgeon and his family, living in Sydney during the late 1920s. Jack Gudgeon is used by Lower as his champion of the working man (although I use the term working very loosely)! Gudgeon is left to fend for himself when his wife Agatha and her sister depart the household leaving only reprabate son Stanley for company.The story follows Jack and Stanley's unorthodox approach to living without Agatha which consists of chopping up the furniture for fuel, many meals of steak and eggs, and parties with fairly dramatic conclusions.Lower writes constantly with tongue in cheek but where as it would be easy to criticise sections of the book as msogynistic, I believe that Jack Gudgeon (in his own unique style) comes to the conclusion late on that perhaps he truly recognises how important Agatha his wife is to him. An example being when he describes the realization he got out of 'hugging the same pair of hips every night'.Perhaps this book is now dated, nearly a quarter century since initial publication, however for me that just adds to the charm of the narrative. A good read for anyone wishing to escape the confusion of the modern world for a while."},{"Title":"A Gray, Gray World","review":"Mr. Cunningham's book &quot;A Gray, Gray World&quot; is a refreshing short story that is an inspiration to a world that is gray and hopeless.

As a straight adventure yarn it carries the reader on a historical roller-coaster ride through 16th Century England, Spain, and Mexico at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Rider Haggard wrote Montezuma's Daughter immediately after the death of his beloved son, Jack. It was a blow from which he never recovered and the deep grief and depression he suffered colours this tale of ancient mexico with a dark despair which is not inappropriate to an account of the last days of the Aztec Empire. But this does not make Montezuma's Daughter a gloomy book. Far from it. Rider Haggard was a deeply (if unconventional) religious man and his hopes and aspirations for mankind shine through the darkness to illumine the pages of this book with his wonderful spiritual philosophy which is perhaps his greatest legacy to his readers. The closing chapters on the fall of the Aztec capital of Tenoctitlan under the relentless assault of Cortez are profoundly moving. In short, Montezuma's Daughter is a most moving and well-written fictional history of the fall of Mexico interwoven with a passionate love story and enough action to keep the most jaded reader on the edge of their seat, whilst those who value the deeper aspects of Rider Haggard's narratives as much as the story-telling will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"Within the first hundred pages, the hero has gone to Spain to avenge his mother's murder, learned how to be a doctor, helped drug a girl about to be walled in a convent cellar, held prisoner on a slave ship, thrown overboard, and is shipwrecked in Aztec Mexico. It gets better from there. And yet the hero is such a nice man: a novelty these days in adventure stories."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"An adventure worthy of Dumas' inkwell.

The author also discribes the characters so clearly that you get an exact picture of who is it that you're reading about. I would recomend this book for everyone because it also has lots of historical facts to it too."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"To my mind this is the best thing that Haggard ever wrote. Written by one of the fathers of the genre it has everything that a Ripping Yarn should have: the Spanish Inquisition!; the Battle To The Death by the Lake of Fire!; the fiendish blood-soaked rituals of the Aztecs! a Quest for Revenge! True Love! All this and more!!It is set in the historical period of the end of the bloody Aztec Empire at the hands of the equally bloody Spaniards. This colossal slaughter and End of An Era is used as the backdrop for the tale of Thomas Wingfield's tragic life and his life, in turn, is used to make this Grand Guignol personal for the reader. As they say, \\"The death of one is a tragedy but the death of millions is a statistic\\". When we read of the thousands dead, bereaved and tortured it is made immediate to us when each of these things happens to WIngfield and his loved ones.The epic love stories are very well done and not at all saccharine. There are two main romantic interests for Wingfield. Though they never actually meet they do battle for his affections throughout the book. Even when in the presence of one he can never totally put the other, and her claims upon him, out of his mind. Haggard very realistically writes of how a woman in love reacts when she detects those sorts of thoughts going on in her man's head!I was also very interested on the book's take on religion. Thomas Wingfield, as an Englishman of the period would, often harshly criticises the Aztecs for their \\"cruel, savage rites\\" of human sacrifice and claims that his God is much better than that. The Aztecs' retort, and you can just imagine their eyes rolling when they reply, is along the lines of \\"Would your God be the one served by this Spanish Inquisition of which you tell us? The one which does not cleanly dispatch it's victims as we do but tortures them for months? The God of the Spaniards who burn our cities for gold and who enslave and rape our women?\\" A nice counterpoint written by a nineteenth century author."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"It is a genuine pleasure to read a book by H.

I found that, whilst it takes a while to accustom oneself to the style, the story actually rings more true because of it.Enough of the story is reviewed here for me to not give more plot away, suffice to say I add my approval rating.

The grieving father wrote \\"Montezuma's Daughter\\" as what his biographer D.S. Higgins calls a \\"therapeutic act,\\" and, following and preceding two of the author's greatest works--1892's \\"Nada the Lily\\" and 1894's \\"The People of the Mist\\"--demonstrates that the author, despite his bereavement, was then at the very top of his game.The novel takes the form of a memoir written by a half Englishman (his mother was Spanish) named Thomas Wingfield. Sitting down to write in 1588, immediately following the defeat of the Spanish Armada (an event that apparently elates Thomas...and for good reason, as it turns out!) and by request of his Queen Elizabeth, the old man relates to us the story of how he took vengeance on the Spanish cavalier Juan de Garcia. Seventy years earlier, Garcia had murdered his own cousin, Wingfield's mother, and the trail of vengeance that young Thomas follows brings him to some very strange places, indeed. (WARNING: Spoilers ahead!) Thomas trails the villain to Seville, where he becomes a quack doctor's apprentice and witnesses the horrors of the Inquisition; follows him to the New World, en route suffering a shipwreck (a shipwreck would also figure prominently in such Haggard novels as 1888's \\"Mr. Meeson's Will,\\" 1905's \\"Benita\\" and 1929's \\"Mary of Marion Isle\\") and a period of slavery aboard a Spanish caraque; and finally fetches up on the shores of what is now Tobasco, Mexico. All that, in just the novel's first 1/3! Once in ancient Mexico, Thomas is captured by the Aztecs, becomes a living god, marries Otomie (the titular character)--despite the fact that he is engaged to an Englishwoman back home--and, like some 16th century Forrest Gump, witnesses the arrival of Cortes and the many battles resulting in the downfall of Tenoctitlan (now called Mexico City) and the Aztec empire. (During all this time, Thomas encounters Garcia on numerous occasions, with the villain always seeming to gain the upper hand somehow.) It is just remarkable how much action and adventure Haggard manages to cram into this work of historical fiction--the book is replete with at least three marvelously described battle sequences, pyramid sacrifices, sieges, scenes of torture, high romance, political intrigue, sword fights, cliffhangers and on and on--and for those readers not familiar with the details of this bit of history, a reading of this novel will certainly prove a fun and entertaining way to learn.Thomas Wingfield was a character obviously very close to Haggard's own heart. Like the author, he resided in Ditchingham in Norfolk, and suffered the loss of his son; to be accurate, somewhat sadistically, the author has Wingfield lose no less than five children during the course of this novel! Also like the author, Thomas marries a woman even though his heart still belongs to a woman named Lily (in Haggard's case, Lilly Jackson, the love of his youth). Wingfield is a wonderful character, headstrong and brave; a deeply moral man, who obviously feels great guilt about marrying an Indian woman when previously betrothed. Otomie, too, is a well-drawn creation, a noble, fearless and loving wife, though still more than half savage, as events prove. De Garcia, it must be said, is one of the best, most sadistic villains that Haggard ever created, and must immediately be placed in the pantheon of the author's great lovesick wretches that includes Frank Muller in \\"Jess\\" (1887), Owen Davies in \\"Beatrice\\" (1890), Samuel Rock in \\"Joan Haste\\" (1895), Swart Piet in \\"Swallow\\" (1899), Ishmael in \\"The Ghost Kings\\" (1908) and Hernando Pereira in the Allan Quatermain adventure \\"Marie\\" (1912). Though the vengeance that Thomas takes on de Garcia is long delayed (20 years!), it is well worth the wait, taking place against the backdrop of the Xaca volcano. And speaking of pantheons, the real-life character of Marina, the native woman who betrayed her people and aided Cortes, must be placed in the pantheon of exotic Haggardian women who dare much for love and sacrifice more, a pantheon that includes Maiwa in \\"Maiwa's Revenge\\" (1888), Noie in \\"The Ghost Kings,\\" Mameena in \\"Child of Storm\\" (1913) and, of course, Ayeesha, from the author's seminal \\"She\\" (1887) and its three sequels.\\"Montezuma's Daughter,\\" in short, is a rip-roaring, sweeping historical adventure with few if any fantasy elements. Haggard, the so-called \\"Father of the Lost Race Novel,\\" needed none of those elements here; his wonderfully described Aztec world is quite fantastic enough, and the various portents and demonic possessions that take place supposedly have a documented basis. It is a tale, as Lily puts it, \\"wondrous strange, more like those that happen in romances than in this plain world,\\" but thank goodness that we had an H. Rider Haggard to give us those wonderful romances! This book, if adapted faithfully, would cost a good $300 million to bring to the screen today, and even then probably wouldn't be half as perfect. This is the kind of novel that one closes after many a thrill-packed night, maybe with a tear in the eye, and says, \\"My God, what a book!\\" This was the 40th novel of Haggard's that I have read, and I'm delighted to report that it is one of his very best."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"One of the best books I've ever read: love, travel, Spanish inquisition, war."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"A quite touching love story set in ancient Mexico.. makes good reading.."},{"Title":"Montezuma's Daughter","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

I was excited to find out about this book. And so disappointed after reading it. There was little if any character development - I didn't really care about anybody in the story. The stilted manner in which the dialog was written was silly - were we supposed to believe that this is the way they spoke? And I can't even count the times the author mentioned something in the story and then wrote \\"but I am not going to go into that here\\". How annoying was that? I could say that I couldn't put this down - but in truth I stuck it out to the end hoping that it would get good. It never did.Better to read Gary Jennings \\"Aztec\\" if you want to get the feeling of what life was life in that place and time."},{"Title":"Uncovering Traditional Quilts: Adventures in Piecing","review":"This book is more than what it might seem at first look. Yes, it is a primer for making simple traditional-style quilts. Beginners as well as more experienced quilters will have excellent results using Joyce Jones' easy techniques, largely new to America. One happy fact is that no triangles have to be cut or pieced to create any of the many new designs in the book - hard to believe, but true! The author presents her system of quilt construction and her \\"quilt shorthand\\" language for analyzing any traditional quilt patterns clearly and with humor. But what I found even more intriguing are the many original designs themselves. I've been quilting for a number of years, and I'm pretty familiar with traditional designs. These quilts look like they might have been made one hundred years ago by our great grandmothers - almost! In each case, there is a freshness to the design; a bit of a different look that lets the reader know this book comes from somewhere else - New Zealand in this case. I'm tempted to make several of these quilts, because I know that each one is going to look original and refreshingly new to my fellow quilters. If you like to piece, like the geometry of traditional designs but want to make something just a bit different from the usual, and want to work quickly and accurately, give this book a try. The author covers, with thoroughness and clarity and excellent illustrations and photos, the basics of fabric selection, preparation, all the steps in quilt construction, and finishing techniques. From inspiration to standing back and listening to the complements, this book will be an invaluable guide to you in your next several projects."},{"Title":"Uncovering Traditional Quilts: Adventures in Piecing","review":"This is an excellent, well set out book with clear instructions to make suck quilts as:Berried TreasuresBishopdaleD'UrvilleFifeshireMarble MountainSandy BayTasman BayTrafalgar Square and others.Using Joyce's Squirty &amp; Squiffy family of quilting shorthand one look through this book should make you think &quot;I can make that.&quot;I have very successfully made mitred borders with Joyce's instructions - they're now a breeze!!!Quilts are photographed on location (eg Berried Treasures in a Berryfruit garden) in and around Nelson, Top of South Island of New Zealand."},{"Title":"Uncovering Traditional Quilts: Adventures in Piecing","review":"Joyce Jones' Uncovering Traditional Quilts provides piecing tips and techniques, showing how to explore combinations of piecing techniques and how to use squares and rectangles to easy advantage.

My father left a book by John Newman, Sermons on Subjects of the Day. He wrote, \\"Let us consider a doctrine much debated and much resisted at this day,--the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration.\\"My first comment, right off, is that the rite of Baptism regenerates no one. The Holy Spirit is the Agent of regeneration, as proclaimed by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ in John 3. It does not happen by some Roman Catholic ritual.Newman added, \\"Scripture tells us expressly that, \`except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'\\"Correct, but the reference to \\"water\\" here is not something performed on an infant soon after birth. The Lord was referring to John the Baptist's preaching that people should repent and be baptized. Repentance should precede baptism, but Roman Catholics have reversed the order. They baptize the infant and then hope the child will eventually repent.Newman continued, \\"...and that God has saved us \`by the washing of regeneration.\\"Let's get the broader context. Paul's wrote to Titus (3:5-7): \\"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\\"The \\"washing of regeneration\\" is something that is done by the \\"Holy Spirit,\\" and no Roman Catholic priest is the Holy Spirit. In fact, the text makes it explicit that it is \\"not because of works done by us in righteousness.\\" A priest who baptizes an infant may think his action is an act of righteousness, but the text says not by such.Newman continued, \\"Baptism saves us.\\"Again, Newman took words out-of-context. Here is what Peter, perhaps the first pope in Newman's view, gave us in 1 Peter 3:18-22:For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.The outward rite of baptism performed on an infant is not what is in view here. First, Christ is the One who saves - not baptism. Noah's family, in the ark, were brought safely through water. It was not the flood that saved, but the ark. The Lord Jesus Christ is our Ark of safety today. Anyone in Him is safe. Baptism saves no one; Jesus is the only Savior. Infants do not have an \\"appeal to God for a good conscience\\" (faith). When a person trusts in Jesus, he/she should then be baptized. The Roman Catholic Church places baptism before faith, but that is the wrong order.Newman falsely affirmed, \\"No other means have been pointed out to us for attaining regeneration, or the new birth.\\"This is so blatantly false. The Apostle Paul told the Philippian jailer to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. A baby has no clue who Jesus is. The biblical order is faith then baptism; the Roman Catholic Church reverses the order.Newman continued in his foolishness, \\"...if a man is not born again in Baptism, it does not appear how he is to be born again.\\"But it does appear! A man is born again by the action of the Holy Spirit in his life. He must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ - entrusting himself to the saving mercies of Jesus alone. To trust in a rite is to reject Jesus as sole Savior.Newman continued his delusion, \\"That Baptism really does change a man's moral state as well as his state in God's sight.\\" Baptism changes nothing. The Holy Spirit opens a man's eyes to the only hope - Jesus Christ - and gives him new birth.Newman continued in his absurdity: \\"...two souls, one baptized and one not, are not in the same moral condition, but that the baptized, as having been regenerate, is inwardly either better or worse, or both at once,--in some things better, and in some things worse,--than the unbaptized.\\"Newman here was speaking poison. Rather than directing the attention of readers to the Lord Jesus Christ, he wanted people to have confidence in their Roman Catholic ritual. In short, the Roman Catholic Church saves. This is exactly what Satan wants. He wants us to take our eyes away from Jesus and toward some mere human ritual performed by some other intermediary. These words of Newman elevate the Roman Catholic priesthood (as in &lt;Do what we say, and we will get you into heaven>) rather than on Christ, the only and ultimate high priest of the entire universe."},{"Title":"Glimpses of abhidharma: From a seminar on Buddhist psychology","review":"I read this book a long time ago. The Abhidharma consists of three &quot;heaps&quot;. One is Psychology. Trungpa was at his very best when this book recorded some of his lectures. And it is &quot;greatly&quot; underrated. He covers pieces of the Abhidharma like a wizard. Each lecture is followed by a question and answer period. So it's really great. One question was what people who were really nuts could do for their pain. Trungpa replied that getting anchored in the body, at what he calls &quot;the animal realm&quot;, will help greatly. Years after reading this, I was leading a Codependents Anonymous meeting. One lady had just been diagnosed as a manic-depressive (no, this is not &quot;nuts&quot;). When my turn came, I suggested that anybody who is zippering off into outer space would usually benifit by manual labor. Such as doing the laundry or washing the dishes. When her turn came again, she said that was exactly what she was going to do (crosstalk is not allowed). I learned this from Trungpa. He also was very much against labeling people this-or-that. In this book, when he was forced by the audience to speak about insanity, he did so in a way that made it sound like insane people were egomaniacs like the rest of us. But so much so that they &quot;spin off&quot;. He describes the two forms in which he believed this happens. I have not looked at this book in 15 years. But it is very good.

I wish other scholars had done this attempt to address to amateur by writing so serious a book."},{"Title":"Zoroastrians: Their religious beliefs and practices (Library of religious beliefs and practices)","review":"The student of religions has few options when it comes to Zoroastrianism. Its scriptures have not been translated into English in over a century and there are vanishingly few scholars capable of dealing with the extreme philological and historical challenges of understanding and translating the material. Thank heavens that of the few books we have, Boyce's book is among them. Flawed though it may be, it is an invaluable overview of the history of Zoroastrianism from the time of its founder to the present day.Boyce did possess ample expertise to motivate and present the history and doctrines of Zoroastrianism in plentiful detail. Too plentiful, in fact, for the tastes of this reader, and I have a large appetite for dry academic material. Even so, plowing through this relentless presentation of technical terms, unfamiliar names, and obscure dynasties and languages was a daunting challenge, even at a short 200 pages.For all Boyce's lavish attention to detail she presents a surprisingly one-sided picture of Zoroastrianism. You would never know reading this book that the historicity of Zarathustra has been challenged repeatedly, or that opinions are sharply divided on whether or not Darius and his successors were Zoroastrians.Boyce has arrived at her conclusions and that is what you get. Her commitment to this interpretation goes too far at times and compromises her scholarly objectivity, as when she refers to the Zurvanites as betrayers of Zarathustra's doctrine and a \\"deep and grievous heresy\\". Such ideas simply do not have a place in academic scholarship.If we are to have too few books on Zoroastrianism in English, I am glad this one errs on the side of too much detail and minutiae.

That said, the history is very well written and covers a disparate group over people through several millennia.

A Monotheistic culture, with an angelic pantheon that in some respects seems polytheistic, Zoroastrians fight to maintain their belief in Ahura Mazda and the forces of good, which they believe is humankind's chief ally against the forces of evil, the Angra Mainyu.

It would be commonly associated with fire worshipers as you would find sacred fires as places of worship. In simple form the fire was to the early man where you gathered for warmth, cooking and where humanity came together. While today the fire may be a symbol of the faith, in its beginning it was much more a practice to bring people together. Zoroaster believed there was a separation of good and evil at creation. How subsequent tenants of this concept transitioned from lessons around a fire to a doctrine still practiced 4000 years later begins with song. Have you ever had a song stuck in your head and you couldn't get it out? Well it was the Prophet Zoroaster who brought what is believed to be the world's first religion to humanity through song. In a land where writing had yet to be invented, Zoroaster would have his priests commit to memory the Gatha in song, later to be written down.This book is an academic account of the tenants of Zoroastrianism from is roots through all is evolutionary changes. With a sense of an archeological dig, the reader becomes aware of not only how the world affected Zoroastrianism but also how this ancient faith in turn influenced the Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions. This religion is still alive in corners of the world with strong holds in Tehran, Iran and Bombay,India. In a chronological format the author begins with an overview of the tenets of Zoroaster in the beginning and then pulls them through history capturing the ebb and flow of humanity, giving the reader a sense of before, after and most important the present day pictures of life as a Zoroastrian. I found myself focused on the travesty brought on to this religion by Islam and therefore spend a bit of time dwelling on its relevant bearing on us today.In the early sections of the book the reader will be introduced to many new terms which may slow down the reading process with words that have no resemblance of English. That is because they are not even close to English sounding words. However spending time to get the cadence and meaning fluent in your mind will make the rest of the book more enjoyable and meaningful. Of the many, the following terms are critical in terms of understanding and enjoying the book:* Ahura Mazda - Ormzad, lord of wisdom who Zoroaster saw as God* Gathas are the hymns composed by Zoroaster which contain the basic doctrine that was committed to memory by his followers* Zend Avesta the sacred book of Zoroastrianism* Vendidad is a book read at night of the Avesta containing the code against demons.* Dakhma - is the funeral practice of placing the dead body on a high platform for the vultures to eat the flesh. When there were only bones they would be collected and placed in an ossuary. This was out of respect for the earth as they believed the body would contaminate the pure earth.* Spenta - is an adjective which characterizes the good creation, possessing power to aid.* The Doctrine of Three Times - Creation, Mixture, Separation - makes history in a sense cyclical, with the world restored in the third time to the perfection it possessed in the first one. Meanwhile all the sorrows and strivings of the present time of Mixture as part of the battle against Angra Mainyu (evil). Thus Zoroaster not only saw a noble purpose for humanity, but also offered men a reasoned explanation for what they have to endure in this life.* Yasna - is the act of worship. It is the main Zoroastrian service* 7 Amahragpands - the seven creations are the first being Ahura Mazda and the six lesser beings forming the heptad with Ahura Mazda himself the six are:o Vohu Manah - Good Purposeo Asha Vahishta - Best Righteousnesso Spenta Armaitiurvatat - Holy Devotiono Khshathra Vairya - Desirable Dominiono Haurvatat - Healtho Ameretat - Long Life* Saoshyant - is the one who will bring benefit; and it is he who will lead humanity in the last battle against evil. (saviour)If one were to distill all the coda into a practical statement on the merits of Zoroastrianism you could say that Wisdom to see things as they actually are, where Justice is the result of making choices in alignment with reality, and Lying being the fraudulent representation of reality. However history and humanity collude to blur this message. The 21st Century view of Zoroaster's original tenant must be viewed through a kollidescope and thus provides reasons for debate. You could begin with the lack of the written word, using only the treasures of archeology as only clues to the testament of what was preached left in the symbols found in art. You must also contend with the evolving languages brought on by conquest, dominion and merging of one ruler over another. The effects are found in conquest and merging of cultures where a King could impose an interpretation of preceding doctrine thus imposing a schism in Zoroastrianism similar to what is found between Protestants, Catholics, and Lutherans in our western world.Since Zoroaster came before the split of the Indo-Iranian culture many of the tenants developed in the beginning had a significant influence over the beliefs, doctrine, and practices, of both the Hindu and the Buddhist people. Against the backdrop of geography and time, we all know that within one language the story takes on at least different colors and many times evokes completely new paths of thought. The next few paragraphs are dedicated to the train to modern day Zoroastrianism. Avestan was the language Zoroaster used in the beginning. This is found in his original Gathas as they were written down long after his death. Pahlavi was the language in the time of the Persian Kings. Sanskrit, albeit equally as old as or older than Pahlavi is the language of India, found it was in prominent doctrine through immigration. The Indo-Iranian split occurred well before Islam, however when Islam forced Zoroastrianism to take refuge tin Bombay, translation from both Avestan and Pahlavi to Sanskrit took on a prominent influence in how we see the Zoroastrian Doctrine today.With regard to critical deviations form its origins one could look at the Zurvanite split as the most prominent. This occurred under the Achaemenians times of Cyrus, Darius, and Xerxes. The Avestan word \`zurvan' means \`time' and in a few of the younger Avesta it was used as the name of a minor divinity, hypostatizing time. The usage appears to be a very limited concession to Zurvanites who had come to believe that Time, Zurvan, did not merely provide the framework for events but was actually in control of them, hence a sentient being. While this would be considered heresy to Zoroastrians it ended up under the rule of the King of kings as being a sect of Zoroastrianism. Simply stated by Zurvanite's through the authority of the King of kings, Ahura Mazda created both good and evil, which is contrary to Zoroaster who said he created all things good, and what wasn't created by Ahura Mazda was evil. One could easily draw the one -v- many parallel story in the division of Eastern Orthodox and Western Christianity.The Manichaeism deviation took root under the Sasanian kings with the introduction of a man named Mani who was reared under the Semitic influence brought a pessimistic view on life. Since he gained favor of the King of kings he was given license to twist existing Zoroastrian text to give authority to his views. Again the original Zoroaster priest found heresy in his preaching.The Mazdakite deviation was brought on an ascetic pessimism where the Sasanian kings found common property to include the women of pheasants as slaves for the royalty. This fractured the families practicing the original tenets of Zoroaster as well strained the loyalty the people held towards their king and his religion. As timing would have it, it was against this back drop that Islam raged through Persia.In 636 (AD) the Muslim Arabs, driven by poverty and religious fervor, had begun to attack the rich lands bordering their deserts. They overran the Byzantine ....please do a keyword search on cigarroomofbooks. There you will find my concluding remarks and a relative bearing on today's world.

Quite honestly, I found the book burdened with non-essential details combined with a complete lack of embedding the narrative in any kind of comprehensive historical context. Boyce version of Zoroastrian history is non-confrontational and not the least concerned with the greater questions of historicity that loom on every corner along the way.As the author of The Great Leap-Fraud - Social Economics of Religious Terrorism, I am probably entirely unsuitable to reading Boyce's book, in particular because I studied a lot of primary evidence rather than pre-cooked secondary sources. Naturally, it may be hard to please me with conformist religious gibberish that seems to derive from Boyce's admiration for this faith of supposed peace, tolerance and care for the poor (as if these would not be expedient central tenets of everybody else). Even though the author hints at some problems with the orthodoxy, she seems to stubbornly refuse to address them. She is not the least irritated by the Zoroastrian claim that they would not have relied on written texts. Is it not obvious to the author that a religion without firm written doctrines would be prone to hi-jacking by just about any vested interest? How does the total absence of evidence prove the historicity of a \\"prophet\\" 6,000 years ago? While it is certainly not enough to stake the claim over 4,000 years later, not even the oldest archaeological evidence is watertight. It may be nothing more than a symbol and a god-like figure, combined with a god that may have been adopted later on. I think that Boyce is reading too much into primary evidence that may have been backdated centuries later, which is possibly a shared bias among academics in the dusty minefield of religion. But then, said evidence points at an entirely different history: one of a religious revolution that may have swept the Middle East somewhere from the sixth to the fourth century BC.While the read itself is challenging, even strenuous, I doubt that many are able to memorize much out of the bombardment of names and places. The book Zoroastrians is for those that do not dare to ask questions and want to learn something about this faith for the sake of being good conversationalists. If you are one of those, pray for never being seated at my table! A disappointing lone star."},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"An anthology of Mark Steyn's work is like giving a drug addict a large supply and telling them to only use a little at a time. It's impossible and it won't happen. I received this just two days ago and have already finished it!Mark Steyn From Head To Toe is a collection of his columns dating back to the early 1990s loosely arranged by the theme of the human body. The essays cover everything from the Clinton impeachment, popular culture and Election 2000 to politics in Canada, the U.S. and Britain. If you've ever read Steyn you know each essay is a combination of humour and erudite analysis. Word play that serves not only to make you laugh, but make real points.There are some real standouts such as his 2001 piece on Mordechai Richler but that said there are no clunkers in the whole bunch. If you love Steyn, you'll love Mark Steyn From Head To Toe."},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"Mark Steyn has written some of most intensely funny and provocative political and cultural material I've read yet. This book is filled with clever, witty incisive humor and powerful observations. His essay on Sinatra is a gem and his conclusions about celebrities in general is masterful. I cannot recall reading so much laugh-out-loud verbiage in ages -- Steyn is truly divine.But don't pass this off as simply humor. It's far more and it's brilliantly written. He rips everyone without mercy but he also tells the truth; it's not funny unless it contains a kernel of truth. Steyn's essays contain the whole cob.His genius shines through on every page and his writing is probably better than anyone in his genre and probably better than those outside his genre.How can he keep up such near-perfection this consistently, essay after essay, and where has he been all my life? Buy this book and give it to everyone you know with a brain."},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"Mark Steyn's writing is brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant. His honest, no-nonsense (yet hilarious) insights into the double troubles of Islamofacism and the West's (especially Europe's)politically and demographicaly appeasing responses are priceless ... and cost him his job in Britain ... two British newspapers just this weekend dropped him for being too hot. My conservative British friends love him ... and are distraught at this. Mark is a breath of fresh air. Always fresh. Buy this book and enjoy some fantastic writing. A true Renaissance man."},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"I read this book, MARK STEYN FROM HEAD TO TOE: AN ANATOMICAL ANTHOLOGY, because I was so blown away by his current bestseller, AMERICA ALONE.HEAD TO TOE is a collection of brief commentaries, obituaries, and other brief pieces, which all contain his dry sense of humor and likeable writing style, yet, after the importance of AMERICA ALONE, (which warns of a fast growing, major threat to Western Civilization), HEAD TO TOE seems very trivial and full of mere fluff.Most pieces are about 3 pages long. I think the longest one, \\"Balls\\"/Mordecai Richler, is 12 pages. I think the oldest piece in HEAD TO TOE is \\"Leg\\"/Breaker, from 15 July 1989; I think the the newest piece is \\"Jaws\\"/Of Defeat, from 7 September 2003. The best obituary is very informative and respectful for Frank Sinatra.Only half of the book seems focused on any type of social/political writing, which I had expected from the author of AMERICA ALONE. The rest is about celebrities and show business, and people inhabiting different levels of fame in those areas. There is a good deal about people I never heard of.If you like Mark Steyn's writing, then this is a good anthology that samples his career. His likeable writing style is present, and the book can be a page-turner for that aspect alone, yet still mostly shallow topics, (for me, at least). There is even a bit of an autobiographical piece, \\"Great BBC Departures,\\" which gives details about Mark Steyn's work as a TV show presenter, and the office politics involved at the BBC.It IS interesting to read about past political situations, (like Clinton/Lewinsky, Gore's campaign stupidities, etc.), to get an amusing insight from Mark, but I am just left puzzled and not interested by half of this book. AMERICA ALONE is technically Mark Steyn's first book, (as opposed to collected shorts in a book, like in this HEAD TO TOE), so HEAD TO TOE is definitely for only the most serious readers of Mark Steyn, who are interested in learning about his past writings.Mark Steyn has another book, THE FACE OF THE TIGER, which is about the post 9/11 era. I will read this book next, and I suspect the subject matter will be closer to the importance of AMERICA ALONE, than of HEAD TO TOE.If you are new to Mark Steyn, then you should definitely read his first official book, AMERICA ALONE, which is excellent!"},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"If you like current affairs and politics, this is right up your alley. Mark Steyn is a real hoot and will make smile....."},{"Title":"Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology","review":"Mark Steyn is the most eloquent and prolific author / commentator that I have read. I don't read much however. In my opinion, Mark is further legitimized by his ability to sicken op-ed readers of many nations on a weekly basis.

It was not easy to study the book due to its condensed material, but it was certainly worthwhile. The fact that the third edition (1954) was published again in 1985 indicate its durability against time, having been classic. Even though 50 years have elapsed since its 3rd edition, the book still remains a valuable source of information on heat transfer and also inspires the hard way of book writing, badly needed nowadays."},{"Title":"Foundations: Early Childhood Education in a Diverse Society","review":"Janet Gonzalez-Mena has written an excellent text for the beginning early childhood teacher. It is filled with reflective thought from her years of experience. This provides a helpful start for new teachers to begin reflecting on their own work and the actions of the children in their respective classroomsThe layout is well thought out beginning with some basic theory and phiolosphy of learning, continuing to important aspects of care as health and safety, children's emotional development, guidance techniques, the role of the teacher and ending with the early childhood curriculum and integrated learning. Interwoven throughout the book is the theme of diversity and how a teacher can deal with it respectfully and successfully for the benefit of all.The basic tone of the book is one you would like to see in every classroom - caring, respectful, considerate, and professional. Using the atmosphere of the book an instructor can easily guide students to reflect on the tone of their classroom and how to create a caring, respectful, considerate and professional place for children.In the capacity of Early Childhood Education Instructor I am looking forward to using this text in a beginning ECE course this October."},{"Title":"Napkins: Lunch Bag Notes from Dad","review":"I worked at Hats In the Belfry (Courney's hat shop in downtown Annapolis) with Cara on breaks and vacations during my 4 years at college.

If you are a solitary and learning I believe you will find it excellent.. However there are 2 books before it that you need and I need..I highly recommend this one"},{"Title":"The Manual (Green Witchcraft, Book 3)","review":"This book really seems like it should have been written before the first Green Witchcraft. And this book goes along with the first Green Witchcraft and not the second one. It also constantly refers back to the first Green Witchcraft, which, in this book, is refered to as &quot;the text&quot;. This book is very much a course with different lessons every chapter.

I have no idea what the problem was with the wet fish from England--get a grip! This book is a course of instruction that uses the first book as a textbook, (duh, that's why it's called &quot;The Manual&quot;) so if you're looking for the next best thing to a classroom study of Green Witchcraft, this is it. If you're not, just stick with the first two books in the series. Some folks like a little more hands on work, and this helps you to get into the actual Craft at your own pace. Wow! Lots of different ways to cast circles and different kinds of altar set ups! Loads of practical information. Hey! I liked it!"},{"Title":"The Manual (Green Witchcraft, Book 3)","review":"I had read the first, the second was just as good, so the moment this came out I went out and bought it without even flicking through it, that was the big mistake! The first thing is the name &quot;The Manual&quot;, well if that isn't setting yourself up as an authority what is?The next is the content, or the lack of it. I had an unnerving sense of deja vu as I started to read, had I not read all of this before? Then the answer came to me, yes I had, whole sections (most noticable on the ogham) had been lifted from the first two and placed neatly in this one. This clever tactic for not having to write more new material is cleverly justified by the idea this book is complimentary to the first two, well it's not, it's a rehash of the first two.The book is well padded out with the constant bombardment of the rede, rules of conduct etc, which I didn't appreciate as I follow a path of personal responsibility &amp; an understanding of a boomerang effect, thus I am capable of making up my own mind about what I shall and shall not do. I don't need to consult a list of rules before every action.The only new information is on palmistry, crystals &amp; deity images, which to honest is the type of stuff you can get for free off of any basic pagan website.I say, leave it on the shelf, the first two are better, and hopefully, the next one, if there is one, might be a return to form."},{"Title":"The Manual (Green Witchcraft, Book 3)","review":"I found this book to be a OUTSTANDING Manual. After reading Green Witchcraft 1 and 2, I found 3 to be a great ending book. One of the things I have found with my children and other people is they don't want to study.(They want it handed to them now)And as we all know that isn't possible with witchcraft.I found in this WORK/BOOK,along with the other 2,a way to teach my children and others,with lessons and guided Meditations to get things rolling. It's set up as classes. Easy to read and understand.I recomment this book to people who are starting out as well as to those who have practiced for years. It would be more helpful if you read the first 2 books.

You will discover just about everything you could imagine or would want to know about Witchcraft from reading her books. However, I strongly urge anyone interested in her books, to purchase all three. Although each book is well written and can be used independently, each book in my opinion compliments the other.

I enjoyed the story very much and can't wait to read the other 2 books.I come from a large family but I found the Marcellis a bit off-putting. The grandfather, especially, is pretty unlovable. I hope he gets better in the next books. The older Marcelli women are kind of cute. I liked how they all pulled together to help Katie out in a major crisis.However, it was the story of Zach and Katie that I enjoyed the most. I like that the story unfolded over months rather than a week or two. (One of my pet peeves is forever after occuring in just a few days). The respect they had for each other from the beginning was wonderful. Even as they disagreed on what to do about the young engaged couple. Her sister, his son. Both 18. Yikes!Another thing I like was the progression of the relationship of the youngsters. It was presented in a pretty lifelike manner, I feel. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read the book so I won't detail the outcome of their engagement. Let's just say I'm glad things worked out the way they did. It was nice to see the women working together the way they did. Gramps could learn a lesson there. Not a likeable man.It was good to see that Katie didn't back down in the face of Zach's unsubtle attempt at blackmail. She is my kind of heroine. Smart and determined without falling into the TSTL category. (Another pet peeve) She has her fears and that makes her very human and easy to relate to.All in all, I do recommend reading this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"SPARKLING ONE (MARCELLI SISTERS OF PLEASURE ROAD)","review":"Event coordinator, Katie Marcelli has just landed a major coup - to organize a huge charity fund raiser. As an added bonus, the man in charge is a sexy lawyer named Zach Stryker. Nothing can take her off her high; not even her loud boisterous family when she gathers with them for her youngest sister's engagement party. To guard from the numerous pleas to settle down and find herself a man, Katie mentions a possible romance with her new client. Imagine her surprise (or horror) to find that Zach is the father of the groom, and of course her family manages to further humiliate her when they mention that they have heard all about Zach, to his amusement.Zach also has a secret up his sleeve - he hired Katie in hopes she'd be indebted to him enough to help him break up the engagement of his 18 year old son (who was born when Zach was 17). Katie doesn't bow to his threats, and they suddenly find themselves attracted to each other. While she doesn't agree with Mia's choice to get married so young, she doesn't want Zach interfering.The first Marcelli saga is a really engaging and sizzling story that probes into the relationships between Katie and Zach; Zach and David; David and Mia; as well as the entire extended Marcelli family headed by the staunch patriarch \\"Gramps\\", who wants nothing more than a male heir to whom he can pass on the family vineyard."},{"Title":"SPARKLING ONE (MARCELLI SISTERS OF PLEASURE ROAD)","review":"Katie Marcelli has just launched her own party-planning business, and she knows that landing a big contract would put Organization Central on the map. When that contract practically lands in her lap, Katie's stunned and excited. Then she meets Zach Stryker, one of the partners of the large firm footing the bill for her organizational efforts, and she realizes the real reason she was chosen for the job: Zach hopes to persuade her (by any means necessary) that Katie's sister's upcoming marriage to Zach's son is a very bad idea.Zach's the only one who believes that two 18-year olds shouldn't wed. The Marcelli clan embraces the idea, as does Katie herself, not to mention the recently engaged couple. Can Zach persuade Katie that these two young people shouldn't be allowed to make a mistake that will ruin their lives forever? And can he keep his hands off Katie in the process?THE SPARKLING ONE has a solid plot which stems from enough internal and external conflict to keep it moving at a rapid pace. Unfortunately, the Marcelli family is so overwhelming and annoying, it's hard to really feel for any of the characters. With the exception of Zach, who is arrogant and cynical, but also charming, sexy, and kind, the rest of the characters have few redeeming qualities.Ms. Mallery's intent must have been the thorough depiction of an Italian-American family, but the characterization falls short of eliciting a humorous reaction. Instead, the boisterous grandmothers, domineering grandfather, and off-kilter sisters come off as stereotypical and infinitely unlovable. I kept expecting Katie to come to her senses and finally run off for good. I also couldn't understand the reason for Zach's sudden acceptance of the family.Overall, a sharply plotted tale that fails to deliver due to shoddy characterization."},{"Title":"SPARKLING ONE (MARCELLI SISTERS OF PLEASURE ROAD)","review":"I tried to like this book.

The Marcelli estate is also a prosperous vineyard, and all four sisters feel pressure from their Grandfather Lorenzo to produce sons and a future heir for the wine company.\`The Sparkling One' is the first book in the series, and concerns middle sister, Katie. At the beginning of the book Katie, an events planner, is hired to host a swanky A-list party for a law firm. Her point-man on the project is divorce attorney, Zach Stryker. There's an instant attraction between Zach and Katie... but things turn puzzling when Zach turns up at her family estate, with his 18-year-old son in tow who is engaged to youngest Marcelli sister, Mia.As it turns out Zach is firmly against the wedding and hired Katie in order to convince her to break up the happy (and young) couple. What Zach didn't plan on was falling for Katie in the process...I'm pretty torn about this book. I liked it, but I also had a pretty big problem with it. I didn't buy the romance. For one thing, Katie is pretty boring. Maybe it was middle sister syndrome, but I didn't believe it when Zach kept waxing poetic about how different, wonderful, smart, funny and sexy she was. I didn't see much evidence of this - in fact I found Katie paled in comparison to her sisters. Youngest sister, Mia, is full of life and charisma. Brenna is funny in the face of adversity, and her twin Francesca is a quirky enigma. Katie was just so \`blah'.I didn't feel a whole lot about Zach either. Mallery talks a lot about what a hard-ass lawyer Zach is, and in his role as divorce attorney he maintains that he's cynical about love. He really should have been more stoic and hard-assed than Mallery made him. I didn't see much of a transformation from cynic to romantic, and by my reckoning he was pretty open-minded about finding love from the get-go. Together Katie and Zach were a pretty mediocre couple. There isn't a whole lot of sparkage, just a few \`kinda sweet' moments.What saved this book, and ensured I will keep reading the series was the family saga. Mallery beautifully sets up books for the other sisters by peppering \`The Sparkling One' with juicy tidbits about their lives and tragically stagnate love lives.In \`The Sparkling One', Brenna is hit with divorce papers from her husband of several years. She never saw the split coming, and is doubly wounded by her husband's revealing he's been having an affair and intends to marry the \`bimbo' the moment their divorce is settled.Francesca was widowed at the tender age of 21 - and maintains that she'd prefer to be single than live through heartache ever again.Mia is engaged in this book - but quickly learns that getting married at 18 comes with a string of problems, not least of which is dealing with the immaturity of your betrothed.While I may not have been invested in the main romance of Katie and Zach, Mallery had me very interested in the bigger family saga. I will definitely be reading the other books in this series, if only to find out what happens to the other (more interesting) sisters."},{"Title":"SPARKLING ONE (MARCELLI SISTERS OF PLEASURE ROAD)","review":"A wonderful new series with just the right amount of love, passion, and the age old need to defend your sister! I just wish some of the history was clearer."},{"Title":"SPARKLING ONE (MARCELLI SISTERS OF PLEASURE ROAD)","review":"I purchased the book for someone in a nursing home. I rated it according to her opinion."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Barbara Coloroso's comparisons between the &quot;three types of families&quot; is painfully contrived and unrealistic, serving only to provide &quot;straw men&quot; against which she can positively compare her &quot;backbone family&quot;. This limits the useful applicability of much of her book.On the other hand, some of her examples of how to deal with common situations (most memorably, mild rebellion and &quot;tattling&quot;) are well-thought-out and well-described and useful applications of clear insight and common sense to child-rearing situations.These individual gems of wisdom are, unfortunately, rather sparsely presented throughout the morass of overblown philosophy. So while the book is not without merit, I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"The family dynamics classifications are somewhat reasonable in that they will get people to think about the environment they are providing for their children. However, this book neglects to talk about how to handle the willfully defiant child, as if all children are born inherently good, selfless, rational, and with a sense of ethics. It also fails to recognize the various mental development stages that children go through such as concrete thinking. It incorrectly represents and then belittles James Dobson's stance that spanking can be effectively used on rare occasions as a method of discipline for 2-5 yr olds exhibiting willfully defiant behavior. There are many other books on child development and building childrens' self-esteem that I think are more credible."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"My twin sister shared this book with me four years ago after meeting Ms. Coloroso at a conference. She, my sister, felt that her life had been transformed by their conversation and by the content of the book. I read it and found that there were some good points regarding conflict resolution and on managing my own responses as we all strive to live harmoniously together. For the most part, I found the rest of the book to be quite forgettable. My approach to parenting is perhaps closer to the brickwall example, although I have only spanked one of my children more than once. Those VERY rare occasions made a strong impression Meanwhile my sister keeps two copies of this book at hand and referrs to it often. Her three children, whom I love dearly, are peevish, demanding, untrustworthy and unfriendly. Her oldest daughter is six years old and is given to screaming tantrums on the floors of restaurants and gorcery stores. I have five children, and have never experienced with my children what they endure on a daily basis. I have often wished I could save them from the influence of this book. And my sisters husband asks us for advice on child rearing constantly"},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"As conventional as Coloroso may make her words of wisdom seem, I did find that after reading her novel, I found myself encountering 'gray areas' and loop-holes within her methods and systems. This is not to say that she is a bad parent, teacher or mentor, I just believe it is fair to assume that the methods and suggestions provided in this parenting book are not subjectable to every family type. In fact, I do believe that the book hardly covers the diversity in our modern world, and socities in which individuals have had, and been, children for centuries. One method in which I consider to be relatively 'unsound' would be the grocery store innuendo. Coloroso's advice to when your child takes a tantrum in the middle of an aisle, is to bend down and say \\"I know you're hungry, tired etc, and I know you're having a bad day, Let's fix it\\" - give me a break.However, on the other hand.. some of Coloroso's work does seem practical and useful, not only in the world of parenting. For example, I found that the way Coloroso described judging of children, and comparison.. was a fair alternative to what I have personally been brought up with. In Coloroso's example, she exemplifies perfectly the theory of walking a mile in another's shoes, in practical forms.. such as, do not compare your daughter's grades to your son's grades, because how would you like your gardening, or cooking etc to be compared to another parent's skills. Touche.Although both my parents have claimed to read this book at some point throughout my childhood, I rarely see parallel's in their methods and Coloroso's. I find myself recently contradicting many of their reasonings and arguments brought forth between them and I, based on the knowledge I have acquired from reading this book.I do recommend this book, however I do not recommend any parent take this too seriously. As a teenager, I don't believe that children or teenagers are appropriately portrayed in this book, but how could they. What parent truly claims to understand the younger generation in it's entirety. This book has overall made me more patient, and has taught me to 'let things go' once in a while. Some lessons in this book are valuable, however a family cannot be catagorized into three types, It is a mixture of culture, influence, and experience.. all meant to find it's own harmony and way of being. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"This book is so vague, lazy, misguided and flat out wrong that it makes me sick. Feel good platitudes about lazy parenting reinforce the notion that kids are NOT worth it according to Ms. Coloroso. How about the repeated notion that parents should not treat their kids in a way that they would not like to be treated. I'm 30. My son is 3. Aside from failing to distinguish the parent from the child, why are we to treat children as peers? I never had the ignorance or arrogance to question a less than ideal grade with one of my college professors on the grounds that &quot;would you like it if I failed you?&quot; The real danger with any New Age idea is that very true and obvious points are sprinkled with absurdities. For example, we need to &quot;give our kids a safe, secure, nurturing environment&quot; - No kidding - compared with &quot;Our goal as parents is to give life to our children's learning - to instruct, to teach, to help them develop self-discipline - an ordering of the self from the inside&quot; - This is humanist, amoral, and completely absolves the parent of any future responsibility for the failure of the child to deal effectively with the real world. Also, what is &quot;self-discipline&quot;? It's real close to actual discipline - But it's not. It's write your own rules. On other topics, self esteem is acquired through overcoming obstacles Ms. Coloroso, not through parents telling you how wonderful you are day in and day out. Competition is bad? Families should not have strict rules or a hierarchy of control? Bedtime is 8:30. I say so. No vote. No appeal. I guess this flake would say I am a terrible parent. This book is an effort to get parents to allow their children to self-parent - treat your children as small unemployed adults and be their friend. This is an obviously unscientific and unresearched book that is comprised of feel good banalities that will offend any serious parent who thinks themselves to be responsible for raising a thinking, responsible and polite child. Aside from its content void and adverb/adjective abuse, this book is wrong on many levels.

Both share similar perspectives in subjects like punishment and discipline. Nonetheless, I find \\"Kids Are Worth It!\\" too theoretical and too often leaves me wondering how to put it into practice.For example, page 88, the paragraph on reconciliation (imagine my 16-year old son, Frank, has rammed my car into the garage door after taking it for a joy-ride):\\"Reconciliation is the process of healing with the person you have harmed. It involves a commitment on Frank's part to honor his plan to make restitution and live up to his resolutions. It also involves a willingness on your part to trust, to risk, and to rebuild your relationship with your son. It is helpful at this point for Frank to go beyond restitution and offer his time and talents over and above those required for the restitution - perhaps by waxing the repaired car every week and painting not only the garage door but the entire garage.\\"Yes, I get it, yet will it matter if Frank's maturity isn't anywhere near this level yet? How do I (the parent) help him, first of all, see that he needs to reconcile with me? How should I respond when he tells me what happened (or when I find out what happened) in a way that will be constructive to our relationship? Sadly, the section just ends there. On the other hand, \\"How to Talk\\" would have answered it powerfully - address what happened and how I feel, without attacking Frank's character (such as name calling).\\"Kids Are Worth It!\\" also has many quotes, some wonderful (such as the one at the start of chapter 2: \\"... The value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults\\") while others are only \\"nice\\".\\"How to Talk so Kids Will Listen\\" and the other two books in the same series are no quick-fix books too, and require a tremendous paradigm shift for parents, especially those who have grown up with challenging relationships with their own parents and/or siblings.

She is not just a so-called EXPERT talking from so-called RESEARCH or case-work. She is a mother herself and provides helpful information through her in-depth examples with valid solutions.

She provides calming solutions, which I find come in especially handy when I as a mother am having one of those days that I am feeling totally insane!

As a Special Ed teacher who has spent 23 years working with kids with behavioral and emotional disorders, I have come to the realization that so much havoc is wreaked by bad parenting.

I actually didn't read the whole book, but all the relevent information to teaching. The book was a little scattered and redundant at times (I actallu read the exact same paragraph in 2 different chapters, deja vu), but overall there were many wonderful points. In the classroom I have noticed many teacher offer rewards for their student to do anything. The result is a bunch of students who won't do anything without a reward. However, I don't believe this is a \\"new\\" problem as Coloroso points out. I do like how she handled it by saying feedback and compliments are important, but your child or student doesn't need to be praised for every little thing they do.If you ar are a parent who already beleives that you are correct about everything and then don't read this book.

However I deeply dislike the idea that families fall under no more that 3 categories designated as Jellyfish, Brickwall, and Backbone. Once you start to read the examples and compare them with your own experience as a kid, and now as a parent, must probably you will see that you have some attitudes that can be classified as backbone and others as Jellyfish and others as brickwall, so this makes those categories sort of useless to decide what type of family are you building. Therefore if you set aside that scheme as just follow the basic advice as who to nurture happiness and trust into the relationship with your kids you will find this book much more useful."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"I really agree with Barbara Coloroso's parenting philosophy and was fortunate enough to actually hear her speak. I loved her description of the jellyfish, brickwall and backbone parent. To this day, I still evaluate parents on that basis, including myself. Coloroso is against rewarding behavior with food and in favor of being consistent and allowing your children to take responsibility for their actions. However, this is not a &quot;quick-fix&quot; type of book. Examples are given, but only a few specific issues are addressed. Also, the book addresses such a wide range of ages that I tended to skip sections that didn't apply to my child's age."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"I found Coloro's approach to be both practical and wise.

LaVora Perry, Author,Taneesha's Treasures of the HeartWu-lung & I-lung"},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Barbara Coloroso (2002), in her book \`Kids are Worth It!' emphasizes the importance of social learning; the concept of parents modeling behavior they have deemed appropriate. While the book was decent overall, I found Coloroso's drawling examples utterly tedious. Coloroso actually discusses techniques for \\"...getting your child to make the bed\\" for 12 pages consecutively! Nevertheless, it does offer practical advice, and Coloroso nicely sum up each of her chapters with easy-to-understand tips and pointers. Coloroso's book makes note of four particular family structures. She labels the families \\"Brick-Wall\\", \\"Jellyfish A.\\", \\"Jellyfish B.\\" and \\"Backbone\\". According to Coloroso, the structures of the particular families ultimately are repercussions of the parenting styles used with the children. In a Brick-Wall Family the \\"kids are controlled, manipulated, and made to mind. Their feelings are ignored, ridiculed, or rejected.\\" Jellyfish A.\\" parents leave their children \\"disoriented and confused\\"; there is a lack of structure in the family and \\"...the parents vacillate between brick wall and jellyfish\\". In the Jellyfish B. family \\"...no one is around to provide a nurturing, caring, supportive environment\\". The children eventually learn to fend for themselves. Backbone families have parents that demonstrate appropriate behavior, listen to the child's point of view, but are still able to say \`no' when necessary. There is a balance between independence and support in a Backbone family. To anyone who has studied developmental psychology, Coloroso's \\"family structures\\" appear to be borrowed from Diana Baumrind's model of the four parenting styles (Santrock, 2001). Baumrind, a leading authority on child rearing, suggests that \\"...parenting styles come in four main forms...Authoritarian, Authoritative, Neglectful, and Indulgent\\". Like the \\"Brick-Wall\\" parent, an Authoritarian \\"...is restrictive and punitive\\". The Indulgent parents \\"...are highly involved with their children but place few limits or restrictions on their behaviors\\". Similar to the Jellyfish B. parents, Baumrind's \\"Neglectful [parents]... are uninvolved in their children's lives\\", and the \\"Authoritative parent encourages children to be independent but still places limits...\\"; sound familiar to Coloroso's \\"Brick-Wall\\" structure? If you think so, I suggest you go straight to the source and read Baumrind's book.In the grand scheme of things, relating with your child's temperament can be a relatively small ordeal. Getting your child out of jail, preventing suicide, anorexia, and drug abuse are major problems and some of the predicaments that Coloroso attempts to tackle. The Backbone parent in Coloroso's family structure becomes knowledgeable of a drug situation by researching at a local library or a related assistance program. When the Backbone parents have a daughter suffering from Anorexia they check her into a specialized treatment center. When there is an attempted suicide in the Backbone family professional psychological help is sought. A concern I have with Coloroso's book is her ability to view these serious yet prevalent situations with the ease that all families striving to be \`backbone' have access to both medical and psychological healthcare, as well as the availability of legal assistance."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"After reading more than a dozen parenting books, I find this one the most contrived and least organized so far. This book is unnecessarily long and goes into excessive detail on how to handle the symptoms of problems without getting to the cause or cure. Some ideas sound great at first but soon get mired down by assumptions, conjecture and unrealistic or inappropriate examples.The author suggests responding to a child bugging for something by saying &quot;Yes, later&quot; only to give in moments later. This must be the source of inspiration for such books as &quot;Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It and How to Stop it&quot; by Anne Cassidy and &quot;Wimpy Parents&quot; by Kenneth N. Condrell.To see the possible outcome of these &quot;positive&quot; tecniques read the book &quot;The Manipulative child: How To Regain Control and Raise Reilient Resourceful and Independent Kids&quot; which is based on observed results not philosophy or opinion.

Brickwall? You know: 'Our way or the highway' parents who gave out spankings and groundings freely. This book describes the three common types of families: Brickwall (just mentioned), Jellyfish (there are two sub-types), and Backbone (the one you should strive for). It was interesting to compare these styles with my own upbringing, and even the bit I know about my parents upbringings. Not my favorite parenting book, but a good one, and I value it in the fact that it might get the message across to folks who may be too rigid or too warped themselves to open their minds to \\"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, and Listen so Kids Will Talk\\"; \\"Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves\\"; \\"Liberated Parents, Liberated Children\\"; \\"Unconditional Parenting\\"; and books of the like."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Wonderful techniques that respect all parties involved as individuals.

I knew there was another way. Among the mothers I knew were many who enjoyed being parents and whose children I liked. They followed another path, one that had no name. Barbara Coloroso not only gives it a name--backbone parenting--she gives understandable, feasible guidelines for doing it.Being a parent with a backbone starts with the golden rule: treat your children as you would like to be treated yourself.On page 12, Coloroso tells the story of how, even with all the behavior modification techniques she had learned as a special education teacher, she found that she couldn't control a child dedicated to not being controlled. That story alone is worth the price of the book.Then she goes on to describe how to constructively influence children and build relationships of mutual trust and respect, working collaboratively with children in their natural quest to grow strong and find meaning in life. \\"Discipline is handled with authority that gives life to children's learning.\\" (page 37). What some might see as something to punish, Coloroso sees as an opportunity to teach.For example,quoting from page 39: There is no problem so great, it can't be solved. Realities are accepted. Problems are solved. (\\"You failed math this term [reality]. I know you can do what you need to do to get the required math credit you need for graduation [problem to solve]. I'm here to help if you need me.\\"I suppose there is some parent somewhere who wouldn't benefit by reading this book but I don't know him or her. I predict you'll be glad you bought it."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"This is by far the best parenting book I've read, and I've read very many. It's not exactly a quick fix for any specific parenting issue, rather it is a push toward a better parenting philosophy in general. She gives the reader a template for parenting children in a respectful, flexible, non-authoritarian, non-permissive, style, and it is up to the parent to fill in the blanks for their individual circumstances. Discipline is a learning experience, not punishment, and the overall goal is to slowly and carefully place responsibility right where it belongs - on the child. She tells us that if we eventually want adult children who are responsible, caring, kind, dependable, and considerate people, the training starts right now. Another outstanding book that uses these same philosophies is How to talk so kids will listen and how to listen so kids will talk. Another book that uses respectful parenting techniques and provides quick one-two page solutions to everyday problems is Positive Discipline A-Z."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"A must have for your parenting library.

But if you want clear-thinking, responsible kids, and don't mind some effort getting there, you can't have a better reference. Ms Coloroso's advice is clear, and should make you think hard about how you interact with your children. Yes my son is 3 and I'm 30. Yes I'm the parent, but he still has opinions about his life, and some are worth paying attention to. And sometimes I'm wrong. Being the parent doesn't make me God. Also note, I'm usually in the right, listening means that I pay attention to my sons' opinions and wants, not that I cave in to them every time.Believe me it's much, much harder making a 3 year old take the consequence of a misbehavior, and helping him try to fix his problem himself than it would be to punish him for it and fix things myself, but oh boy does he learn more when I put in the effort.This is not minimum effort parenting, and it's not about letting your kids always having their own way. It's about teaching them how to think rather than what to think."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"As another, more supercilious reviewer notes, the ideas in this book are similar to the work of the developmental psychologist Diane Baumrind. However, this in no way detracts from the value of the book for three reasons: First, it means that the ideas are based on scientifically supported ideas. Second, explaining parenting styles only takes up one chapter at the beginning, then Coloroso builds on the ideas with her own. And third, comparing the presentation of Coloroso's books, tapes, and videos with reading a scientific paper is silly! ...Most people will neither have access to, nor enjoy reading dry academic papers.. And they are not likely to be able to suddenly derive from them, the kind of carefully thought out and articulated system of parenting that Coloroso offers. From concrete examples as well as abstract ideas, this book will help you incorporate commonly held goals of parenting into real-life interactions with your kids. This is not a book on just one concept or how to handle one particular parenting problem, but a way of thinking about parenting that makes each concrete situation so much more clear cut.You will like her style if you value giving kids BOTH a warm, respectful, open relationship where they can feel safe to be themselves and develop their own unique identity, AND an environment with strong clear boundaries where they can grow to understand how to make healthy compassionate choices for themselves and those they care about... And if you are tired of books by \\"experts\\" who have never been parents. This book grew out of Coloroso's lectures, which grew out of her own teaching and parenting experiences, and it is clear that she \\"has been there\\" and she practices what she preaches.Because this book was once lecture material, Coloroso dose sum everything up into, sometimes silly, but catchy little phrases as some have noted. However, I have found them incredibly useful through the years as issues arise.. When my step-daughter and I butt heads, like a mantra I hear in my head \\"Children need to know how to think not what to think.\\"... or when my two year old \\"painted\\" our new linoleum floor, I took deep breaths and chanted \\"Never treat a child at six a way your don't want to be treated a sixty\\".. or during the thousand other trials that a blended family endures everyday I try HARD to remember the ultimate goal of parenting which is to raise adults who can say, \\"I like myself, I can think for myself, and There is no problem so great it can't be solved\\". In Coloroso's way of thinking these simple phrases translate to: model correct behavior consistantly eveyday, help your children to learn to make better choices in the future through natural consequences and making incorrect behavior an unattractive choice, and teach them to solve problems by progressively allowing them to earn more responsibility for thier choices and the consequenes of those choices... and much, much more.If you are someone who needs to hear from experts to be convinced: I was first exposed to this book when it was used in my mother's school for children with behavioral problems as a training guide for teachers, then I found it again as a frequent recommendation in my Le Leche League's library, then just today I sat in a crisis counselor's office and listened as she quoted directly from the book to my husband and his ex-wife when they asked about parenting a troubled teen. If you don't like to read, go to her website and get the video \\"Winning at Parenting Without Beating Your Kids\\". This is a good stuff!..."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Having just heard Ms. Coloroso speak, I can say with certainty that her critics here online who claim she teaches kids new-age ideas and is anti-family discipline are wrong. Her emphasis is emphatically on teaching kids to be respectful of themselves, people in authority, and their communities. She says that if you teach kids to do what you say just because you say so, they'll grow up to do what people in their peer groups do because they can't think for themselves. But you're still the parent and the one who draws the line in matters of security, morality, and legality. One of her shorthand references shows the differences between punishment and discipline. Her idea of discipline is to show kids what they've done wrong, and give them ways to solve the problems they've created, but allow them to keep their dignity. If your idea of traditional discipline involves shaming children when they make honest mistakes or &quot;explaining&quot; decisions by saying, &quot;Because I said so, that's why,&quot; then she's not your kind of disciplinarian. But if you want to teach your children to think for themselves so that they can grow up to be less influenced by their peer groups and work well with other people at home and in their communities, her theories are worth a look. And as for the London reader who says the book is &quot;Typically American,&quot; I suggest that person spend some time familiarizing himself or herself with the styles of parenting that actually prevail in this country. If her attitude were typically American, there'd be no need for this book."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"I just picked this book up in a grocery store and I can not believe how excellent it is. It has completely changed how I deal with my kids. I am not yelling anymore. I wish some of the parents I know were reading it. Everything she says makes perfect sense and that's why it's so easy to change. I recommend it to anyone who wants to quit being their child's conscience and instead give them the gift of developing and using their own."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"I'd like to give this book 3.5 stars. I bought three parenting books at the same time from Amazon: Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles; How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk; and Kids Are Worth It! and read them in that order. When I first started Kids Are Worth It!, I was only 10 pages into it and put it down for a couple of weeks. I had a hard time with the intro because it felt condescending and harsh at times. (Ironically, it was like I was being lectured by a parent.) I understand that approach might work well for the author when she speaks publicly, but in print it feels like a turn-off. I was determined to read the book though, so I picked it up again and started feeling more positive toward the book when it explained the three different types of families: Brick-wall, jellyfish, and backbone.Some people object to this book because they feel there are more than three types of families, but the book acknowledges that some families will be a \\"patchwork of all three\\" (p. 39). This makes sense to me because I grew up in a family that falls mostly in the brick-wall category but has some features of a jellyfish-b. At times the author does make it sound like all brick-wall (or jellyfish) families have the same exact traits she writes about, but that would be impossible because each family is unique. The descriptions of brick-wall and jellyfish families are general and should only be used as guidelines.Somewhere around the middle of the book, it starts feeling a little random because sections start popping up about all kinds of stuff. A lot of it is helpful, but some of it may only apply to a certain group of parents (like the section on potty training). The index can assist the reader in finding specific topics, but not all, as \\"potty training\\" or \\"diapers\\" doesn't appear in the index but is mentioned in the book.There are sections of the book that I find hard to believe will work with kids. I don't have a child that's old enough to try the ideas on, so I can't confirm if they work. But one example is \\"The Game and the Sit.\\" Two children have a fight over a game so the backbone parent tells the children they must sit together on the couch and neither can get up until they both give each other permission to get up. That's it. There's not much else the author says about resolving the situation. I have a hard time envisioning two arguing children cooperatively sitting on the couch together, agreeing that they will give the other permission to get up, and ending their argument. Maybe it happens, but I have a hard time imagining that it's that simple.I'm glad I read Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles first because I felt that it was an easier read and focused more on relationships between parents and children with far fewer tangents. Kids Are Worth It! covers a ton of issues between kids and parents, some of them without much detail and others with some helpful pointers. Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles helped me develop my parenting direction and Kids Are Worth It! added some additional practical ideas to the mix."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"It takes much longer to follow the advice given in this book than it does to slap a child - but I think the results are excellent. My 4 and 3 year olds hit each other significantly less now that I have told them that the rule in this house is &quot;we don't hit&quot;. But boy, it can be seriously exhausting with 2 very stubborn children to carry out her theories. We're carrying on with it because I seriously believe she is right and the children learn to think for themselves - go for it, take the plunge too and learn how to treat your children how you were probably not treated yourself!

Anyone working with kids needs the solid advice this book has to give."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Although the book is focussed on parenting, the ideas and philosophies the author promotes apply to anyone who works with kids. I have found that using the techniques suggested in this book as made me 100 times more effective in my job. Colorosso understands the value of self-awareness and an internal locus on control in healthy development. The book not only helped me in work with kids, it also gave me insight into myself, my experiences, and my relationships in general. I believe that the 3 types of families - backbone, brickwall, or jellyfish - also can be seen as 3 personality styles, so that we are not only brickwall, jellyfish, or backbone people with kids, we are that way in general, where our relationships are concerned. If you look at it this way the book will go a long way to giving you tools to deal with all sorts of conflicts in your life."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"Wow! Where has this book been in my life? I've read most of the parenting books out there, and this one is the best concise overview I've come across. The author gives real examples of the issues we all face, such as chores and temper tantrums. It seems her basic principle of inner discipline means respecting your child as an individual, taking responsibility for yourself and teaching them to make good choices by learning from their own mistakes. Forcing your child to do what you think is right doesn't allow them to LEARN. This is fantastic."},{"Title":"Kids Are Worth It!: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline","review":"A couple of decades ago we figured out that hitting kids is NOT good for them.

This is the greatness of the work - how he distinguishes naturalistic impulses and effects from their spiritual counterparts. Do I real have the peace that surpasses all understanding or do I simply have a phlegmatic and complacent temperament? Von H combines razor sharp logic with real heart and passion - a kind of combination of St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine. He also brilliantly shows how the Christian life requires that we hold opposites within ourselves - we must be zealous and passionate about our transformation in Christ and yet we must be sweetness itself, drinking deeply of Divine patience. Make no mistake, this is a difficult book - each of the 18 Chapters is challenging and , like all spiritual classics, we are likely to squirm as we face uncomfortable disclosures about ourselves - we begin to see that Von H has indeed diagnosed our sham spirituality as being the mere manifestation of naturalistic impulses. To give an idea what this book is about, I will make some short observations on each Chapter, but these are only initial thoughts and reflections - there is immense depth in this book (500 pages) - Von H, like Cassian, has a wonderful insight into the manifold varieties of the human person - he knows us through and through. How wonderful it is that the Church has had such a great philosopher and lay man, a husband and a father, to serve Christ and his Church. Dietrich Von Hildebrand pray for me!The readiness to ChangeIn this Chapter, Von H puts before us the stark choice we are given: do we really want to be transformed in Christ - all of us who seek to answer this question know that there are all sorts of resistances we put up against the inflow of God's grace - we wish to retain our own areas of sovereignty but Von H urges us to be like wax ready to receive the stamp of Christ. But, God does not wish to annihilate our personality and freedom - the paradox is that we only become our true selves so that our unique personality shines when we become transformed in Christ. And this is where Von H brilliantly shows us true personality versus the kind of conventional personality into which we have grown, petrified by prejudices and conventions. Readiness to change and be moved towards Christ: this is the key.ContritionIn contrition, Man finds his greatness, he humbles himself and submits to God, knowing that he has done wrong.Self knowledgeVon H contrasts the real desire to know thyself with a mere neutral observer type attitude, typical of the psychological approach. The former can only be realised though a radical confrontation with God. \\"We ought to feel a boundless gratitude to those who rudely destroy our illusions concerning our person\\". \\"We mistake our enthusiasm for a virtue for its real presence in us\\". We need the help of other so are illusions about ourselves can be shattered.True ConsciousnessHer Von H excessive self consciousness with true consciousness, the latter involving a kind of loss of oneself in response to value. We should not pry into our psychic entrails and become self obsessed - we must not go around self consciously doing good - in fact by doing so, we destroy the good we are doing. \\"A truly conscious person has so far advance over his nature that he no longer agrees implicitly to all its suggestions\\". \\"Unconscious man gives himself entirely to the moment's experiences\\". We must become truly awake and simple.True simplicityComplexity is not profundity. Von H shows us what it true simplicity and what is sham simplicity. He notes that the reductionist who \\"walks through life with a boastful smile, proud of being past all obscure and grave difficulties\\" is not simple but merely engaging in platitude, levelling all depth and value with his reductionist approach. \\"The basic error of all simplicity lies in the assumption that it is a simple thing to have true simplicity\\" and \\"No deficiency of natural dispositions can prevent us from transformation in Christ\\". Simplicity is \\"the unity of a life anchored in God\\". Simplicity is linked with continuity. \\"The truly simple man always preserves his basic identity\\". Von H warns us of the draw to shallowness and the movement to the periphery which conflicts with the desire to be simple such as indulging in magazines, visiting fashionable beaches, going to music halls, shows, cinemas etc. He is supremely practical here. These things \\"dishabituate the mind from the unum necessarium and so interfere with the progress towards simplicity\\". We must expressly offer everything to God and always and everywhere give thanks. We must have a \\"permanent attitude of sursum corda, of eagerness to be let ourselves be borne aloft to God\\". But to attain simplicity, we need the contemplated attitude of Mary: \\"Martha, Martha, thou art careful , and art troubled about many things; but one thing alone is necessary\\"Recollection and contemplation\\"In recollecting ourselves, we empty our soul of all current concerns, and are no longer possessed by the things which fill our life\\". When we are dispersed, we are not really and truly alive. Even in activity (even intellectual activity) \\"our awareness of God continues to resound in our soul like and unending melody\\". But to achieve this \\"we must bring ourselves to a full and exclusive awareness of God\\" from time to time. And this is where the \\"heart\\" comes in, showing Von H's personalism: \\"Many of our emotional acts have a contemplative character\\". We must dwell in the present. \\"In contemplation, I abandon myself to an object as a majestic entity which reposes in itself and does not me in order to exist\\". The key here is receptivity and a restful attitude . But contemplation is not mere relaxation as it involves intense spiritual activity. And this is where Von H himself seems to soar, one becomes acutely aware that a kind of mystical experience must have informed some of his insights. He cites the wonderful passage from St Augustine in the City of God: \\"There we shall rest and we shall see; we shall see and we shall love; we shall love and we shall praise. Behold what shall in the end without end\\". To come to this inner stillness, we must have times of silence and solitude. Von H never loses site of practical considerations and warns us that contemplation requires a degree of mental alertness which is not consistent with the exhausted state where we react impulsively and lose control of our reactions. We need rest! And again, the practical man comes to the fore: \\"Since e are psycho-pysical beings, we cannot invariably live with the same spiritual intensity\\". We need recreation and rest- this is the result of our fallen state and we must not in pride resist their call. He ends this Chapter with a stream of beautifully recollected thoughts.Pride\\"Humility involves the full knowledge of our status as creatures, a clear consciousness of having receiving everything we have from God\\". As St Catherine of Siena puts it: \\"That Thous shalt be, and that I shall not be\\". \\"Humility calls upon us to allow our hearts to be wounded by the glory of God, to fall on our knees in loving adoration, and to deliver ourselves over to God entirely\\". Thus we can \\"blissfully assent to our creaturely status\\". Let us be filled with a holy longing for God. The humble man \\"finds the cause of his joy in the magnolia Dei, the glory of God, as mirrored and signified by the cosmos and its wealth of values, including, in particular, the values he discerns in human beings other than himself\\". \\"Humility prescribes all contemplation of one's own values, the humble man will never direct his glance to one of his own virtues, lest he should lapse into pride\\" . \\"The humbles one has divested himself of all hardness; he faces his fellow men, not mailed and armoured, but in the luminous attire of invincible charity. Even his foes - and this is the test of meekness - he confronts unarmed.\\" \\"he is past all self-assertion\\". \\"He who speaks the word of total assent to his finiteness and limitation will thereby illuminate his nature with an aura which in some way images the unlimited breadth of God\\".Confidence in GodVon H again alerts us to spiritual counterfeits - confidence in God is not about optimisim, \\"smugness masquerading as religiosity\\". Our trust in God must be absolute. \\"We must never say that God has rejected our prayer\\". We must see suffering against the backdrop of the Cross but remembering that \\"death really and objectively is a terrible thing\\". Von H never stops looking into the depths and glossing over the metaphysical reality of all things, including death. We must confront all our anxieties and fears with God.Striving for perfection\\"The vision of the beautiful, as Plato says (Phaedrus 249d) causes the soul \\"to grow wings\\". \\"Whenever a true value affects us, whenever a ray of beauty, goodness or holiness wounds our heart...a certain actual change is produced in our being which...will leave permanent traces far outlasting our actual experience. By this spiritual nourishment our very essence will be changed and ,as it were, leavened.\\" \\" love-relationship rooted in Jesus is certain to transform us and to bring us nearer to God\\". And Von H, having discussed things in depth, never sidesteps practicality: \\"We must avoid contact with everything that has an air of triviality...to avoid certain unnecessary conversations, to do without the entertainment provided by shallow readings, to shun everything that panders to out delight in sensations, in general, to steer clear of whatever is calculated to draw us away from God\\". Von H reminds us of the importance of work: \\"the absence of regular activity and effort - cannot but demoralise us and hamper our inward progress\\".True freedom\\"The true Christian must see everything in conspectus Dei.\\" But Von H is always practical and sensitive to the impact our person may have on others: \\"There are situations in which charity requires me to exercise particular discretions lest I should perplex or repel others\\". Von H again brilliantly shows us what is true freedom in Christ and what may have a satanic source, whilst producing similar effects tot true freedom. Thus he says: \\"It is utterly unreasonable to shy at the idea of receiving any intellectual help or guidance from others, to insist on working out one's ideas all by oneself and to remain uninfluenced throughout\\". The true Christian understands his dependence on others and the interdependence of community. We must not be a slave to whatever is \\"in the air\\" or to conventionalism. \\"The true Christian is of necessity unconventional\\". \\"He is untrammelled by any prejudice\\". He notes how we can drift away from contemplating the value of a thing and be caught up in mental associations: \\"For instance, we find a place unlovely and depressing because on some earlier occasion we were all there. A melody seems to us devoid of beauty because it remind us of a gloomy period of life\\". Von H is spot on here and I have seen such things being operative in my own life until I brought such experience to Christ, the healer of memory - one is then free to contemplate things as they are, not as they have appear by association! Von H goes through all the various attitudes we may have and bring us up short by saying: \\"\\"He who is truly free knows - with a living knowledge - that everything is an unmerited gift of the merciful goodness of Go, that before him we are beggars devoid of any claim whatsoever\\"Hunger for justiceVon H contrast the hunger for justice with indifference and a hunger rooted in pride, the hunger for self-gratification. He makes the illuminating insight that \\"He who is dominated by his thirst for happiness bars himself from access to true and deep happiness\\". He contrasts respect for justice with hunger and thirst after justice. \\"Day and night we must be swayed by the burning desire that God be glorified in all things\\". Again he contrasts thirst for justice with an aggressive destructive natural zeal for God, a zealotry devoid of all kindness, a fanaticism sinning against charity. Again, our natural urges are counterfeits for real thirst for justice - we squeeze everything into the shape of our own personality to bring about justice by the force of our own dynamism. Our zeal must instead have the quality of soaring tranquillity.Holy PatienceIt is not stoic indifference or a Buddhist placidity. Impatience is a non-acceptance of our creaturliness, that things do not come within our sovereignty - we must wait and we must undergo an interval of inner maturing and organic development. As Pascal notes \\"Christ wills us to fight with Him, not to conquer with Him\\".Blessed are the peacemakersWe must be wary of the natural pulls of our nature. We should not \\"implicitly trust its reactions and unquestioningly interpret moods as the index of an objective fact\\". \\"We must not be seduced into enjoying the wrangle or the blows we manage to inflict on our antagonist\\". But beware again of spiritual counterfeits of peace. \\"Sated contentment or a peace of mind due to thoughtlessness or illusion, is not a good but an evil - no matter how pleasant it may subjectively feel\\" . Again Von H is always aware of our metaphysical position that we are wayfarers in a valley of tears and have to accept all that means for us here and now: \\"It is utterly false that we ought not to sorrow over a real misfortune. Any attempt to evade the cross, be it by a mental technique or illusion that we are, essentially, no longer in the valley of tears but in the realm of eternal happiness is hopelessly mistaken\\". But we must not cleave to grief - a thing we may be tempted to do when faced with the death of a beloved, so much so that we become comfortable with our grief and fall into a vortex of sorrow.Holy MeeknessThe meek man \\"would enforce nothing; he accords everything the time required by its inward law of unfolding. Despite all its fervour and intensity, his effort retains a quality of graciousness, unhardened mellowness\\". And yet with this must be zealous - we must hold in our being two apparently opposite spiritual dispositions - zeal and patience - a kind of hypostatic union. \\"The aspect of which meekness embodies a specific expression is that of a serene mellowness inherent in the perfect attitude of love\\". Von H warns us about sulking, which is linked to pride and concupiscence! \\"Meekness, just as patience, implies one's abstinence from assuming a false position of sovereignty above the universe\\"Holy Mercy\\"Mercy, then, responds to misery\\" and is a bending down in love. Again Von H shows us some counterfeit forms of mercy such as indiscriminate generosity and pliability, where the motivating factor is not the good of the recipient of the act of generosity but the enhancement of the subjective feelings of the giver.Holy SorrowVon H again insists on the \\"coincidentia oppositorium\\" - that union of apparently irreconcilable opposites. Von H brings to our attention the duality inherent in man's metaphysical state. We are already children of God but we are still in a valley of tears. We are still living in hope and expectation, we do not yet see God face to face. We must remain aware of this situation and not skip over this state and act as if we are already in paradise. So, we must hold in our hears two opposite positions: \\"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted\\" (Matt 5:5) and \\"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice\\" (Phil 4:4). Although Von H does not mention this, it seems as if all heresies and errors constitute a refusal to juggle what appears to be in contradiction - thus the person with a sorrowful inward pull may opt for Matt whereas the jovial type of guy may feel Paul warrants a continuous air of joy but we must have both. Specifically we must accept the cross; \\"To evade the cross is to evade Christ\\" but \\"all our sufferings are transfigured by a ray of light\\". However, \\"joy is the superior and consummate reality\\" as we view everything in the light of eternity.Holy SobrietyVon H warns us about taking an overly optimistic view of human nature and not respecting certain metaphysical truths: we die and it is a truly dreadful thing. Again he warns us about spiritual counterfeits.True Surrender\\"In the measure that man submerges himself in his adoration of God, his personality becomes ampler and richer, and adorned with higher values\\". Again Von H reminds us of counterfeits: \\"the difference between purity and lack of sensuality\\" and \\"the peaceful serenity of a saint and the emotional obtuseness of a Stoic\\". \\"True surrender on the contrary implies that we are entirely centred upon the object in which we lose ourselves\\". True surrender is a \\"sanctioned act, ratified by the free and conscious centre of our personality\\" in contrast to being swept off one's feet."},{"Title":"Transformation in Christ","review":"Thanks be to God for gifting this author with so much clarityin thinking, wholesome approach to the true nature of humanity, andability to translate his wisdom into understandable concepts which can be applied in daily life.

Yes, we can learn a lot from the animal kingdom and that is why the author decided to write this book. Having been an avid animal behavior student for many years the author has observed their lessons and been awed by them. For example young clown fish brush themselves against the tentacles of sea anemones to inoculate themselves and thus get immune to the poison. In time, they are able to dive into the tentacles and live there in safety. Clown fish have instinctively understood the effectiveness of vaccination for thousands of years before humans discovered it. This is an upbeat and fun book to read that draws analogies from animal behavior and transposes them to human society. The book will help people learn lessons that they might not learn from a didactic or abstractive book. It illustrates with stories about animal behavior how everyone can learn and improve, not only their businesses, but also their lives. There is no other book on the market, which shows so well how humans could learn from animal instinct. Perhaps this book will show that the animal instincts we used to survive in the age of dinosaurs are just as valuable today in our 21st century high tech jungle - albeit a slightly different jungle. Corporations and individuals still face the same primeval battles of supremacy - of predator and prey - in the workplace today. This book will be indispensable to their survival and prosperity."},{"Title":"The Book As World: James Joyce's Ulysses","review":"French does a powerful job in presenting her views on this novel. Often in the opening section she leaps magnificently and jarringly from episode to episode within the same paragraph, leaving the breathless reader wondering what are we discussing now, as more often she dismisses too easily other commentators while expressing her own views upon her own authority without providing objective proofs from the novel. Her section by section analysis leaves one only slightly less breathless.Nevertheless, as in all things Joyce, this commentary provides more than substantial food for thought and opens interesting areas for contemplation of this magnificent and eternal work.In the opening episode of Ulysses we find Stephen paraphrasing Mr. Wilde by calling Irish art the cracked looking glass stolen from a slavey. And thus each commentator views the depths of their own soul within the novel, and presents their perspectives as solidly based within the novel, when it is only after all a personal impression, like seeing a woman's hand in a passing small cloud. French's other forte is women's issues.Very much like a whale.And so my perceptions from the novel after repeated readings ofUlysses (Gabler Edition)and hearings of theUlyssesrecording by Donal Donnelly, may differ quite strongly from those so forcefully stated by French, and I may provide chapter and verse to disprove some of her statements, or provide skepticism regarding others' absolutism.Nevertheless, I find her insight and expressions bracing cold water cast upon the nodding, napping complacency of my own solipsistic impressions and provide a parallax most useful in coming to see what is really going on here in the Dublin of June 16, 1904, and what is going on here within each reader's soul who must construct meaning from this myriad great novel, including my own.Thus I recommend this learned if for me slightly flawed commentary to any reader of James Joyce, a lifetime avocation, as one supplement to the already Talmudic body of commentary which has gathered, and which must ever be read, as tea leaves in a cup, as clouds above, as smoke arising from a turf fire.Read this book, and do read The Book, Ulysses, and every single other commentary you can find, of which several may be found quite favorably here upon the amazon."},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"&quot;Oldies, but Goodies,&quot; still hold true today.

Some stories revolve around well known Forgotten Realms characters; Drizzt Do'Urden, Arilyn Moonblade, Elminster, and Jander Sunstar to name a few. Plus there is an Afterword by Jeff Grubb that tells of the \\"secret\\" history of the RealmsLord of Lowhill by Douglas Niles- This story follows two halflings, Pawldo and Stefanik, as they search for treasure in a dark, evil place. Pawldo is found in the Moonshae Trilogy.Negatives:1. Clich&eacute;. The story just seemed like a clich&eacute;. Greed takes one adventurer to far and he realizes it to late. It just seemed clich&eacute;.Positives:1. Characters. I did like Pawldo and Stefanik. I'm not quite sure really. Like my theory on halflings says, halflings give people consciences. Dang halflings.2. Fun read. It started out kind of boring and whatnot, but ended up being a pretty fun read.Overall: 4/5*If the story would have introduced something different, it could have really benefited.*Elminster at the Magefair by Ed Greenwood- The story is about Elminster and Storm Silverhand going to a magefair to pick up a key. The key invites trouble from younger mages and an old friend.Negatives:1. Boring story. It's not a bad story by any means, it just wasn't all that exciting.2. Confusing towards the end. There just was to much going on to really follow. Then of course, you have to sit and think about what happened and what was so important.Positives:1. The magefair. That was really the only interesting and fun thing in the story. The fireball toss contest was pretty funny and amusing.2. Didn't overburden you with names. I've been told that Ed Greenwood likes to use a lot of names. This story was an exception and it worked pretty well.Overall: 3/5*If things were slowed down at times and sped up at others, this could have been a better story.*One Last Drink by Christie Golden-This story is about Jander Sunstar, a gold elf vampire. The story's events are before Vampire of the Mists. It tells of how Jander escaped his vampire master.Negatives:None. Yeah, I have no complaints or annoyances with the story at all.Positives:1. Jander. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters (along with Drizzt Do'Urden, Erevis Cale, Aliisza and Kaanyr Vhok for example) and this story really shows why. I just can't help but feel sorry for him...2. The set-up of what happens. I really did like what happens and how everything feel into place. The way Jander handled himself and broke his enslavement was just great.3. Details and Descriptions. I like how Christie Golden describes everything. You can feel the malice and fear of everyone. The 'gory' (for lack of a better word) details she uses are superb.Overall: 5/5*I like Jander. But irregardless, the story telling was perfect*The Bargain by Elaine Cunningham- About Arilyn Moonblade and Danilo Thann and their attempt to warn the Pasha of Tethyr of an assassination.

The only problem I had was how it ended. It ends a little confusing with the clink of metal. Not a really big negative, but I had to reread that paragraph to understand about the 'daggers'.Positives:1. Characters. Arilyn, Danilo, and even Hasheth were good characters. I like Arilyn because of her demeanor and temper at times. Danilo (I've read a few scenes in the Liriel Beanre series he was in and I liked him then) for his humor. Hasheth for his single mindedness and naivet&eacute;.2. Plot. I liked how everything fit together and how it ended up. I didn't really expect that so and so was really the target. It ended in a way I thought was fitting.3. Bonus funny positive...

First Person point of view. While I was glad for something new and different in a Forgotten Realm story, the view point seemed to be lacking a lot of details.2. Predictable. The story was one were you knew something was going to happen. I didn't except the person, but I just knew something like that was going to let Koja print his book.Positives:1. Different Style. Along with the viewpoint, I thought it was interesting that Koja wasn't in essence a hero. He didn't fight any monsters or evil people, just stood for what he believed in. That made the story different and fresh.2. Koja. He was interesting character because of what I mentioned above. He wasn't high and mighty, he was a normal person wanting to better the world with knowledge.Overall: 3/5*Better details could have made this story much better*A Virtue By Reflection by Scott Ciencin- The story is a murder mystery. The ruler of the city Arabel, Myrmeen Lhal, tries to solve the murder of Penn Othmann, a merchant. Myrmeen encounters a race called cat lords, which holds the key to the mystery along with a young girl.Negatives:1. Boring. I hate to say it, but this was a boring story. It never really interested me.2. Cat lords. What are they? There really wasn't a good explanation other than they are half cat/ half human, with the ability to shift into a cat. It just seemed like someone was looking at too much Japanese cartoon when they were writing this. But seriously, I didn't really understand the whole race, and honestly didn't know about the race at all. I liked it better that way.Positives:1. Good Mystery. I can't give to much away but I thought the premise of the story was a good idea. The execution was done wrong. How it was all explained was done well I thought.2. Zaehlas Alandovos Zacharious or Zaz. I did like the leader of the cat lords though. He did have a cool demeanor and a self of humor that made him likable.Overall: 2.5/5*What held this back was the execution of the story. Just dull and unexciting.*King's Tear by Mark Anthony- The story is about Tyveris, a former sell-sword turned monk, and his mission to recover a stolen item, called King's Tear, from a necromancer named Kelshara. Along the way, Tyveris learns that not everything is stopped with a weapon.Negatives:1. Predictable. You knew what was going to happen. You knew what 'weapon' was going to stop Kelshara.2. Underdeveloped Characters. The characters didn't really seem to grow and weren't very interesting. Kelshara is the best example. She started the story, yet she didn't really seem like a true villain, even though it's obvious she was. She really came off as just too evil.Positives:1. Fun read. It was a really quick exciting read. There wasn't any real dull parts. It really seemed that every scene set up the follow scene. It really kept me wanting to read.2. Just desserts. The ending I thought was really good. Sure, a little clich&eacute;, but I really thought it was worth it. Not to mention, it was written very well.Overall: 3.5/5*The Characters are what really brought this story down.*The Family Business by James Lowder- The story is about a father-son highwayman duo. Artus Cimber is learning the tricks of the trade from his father, the Shadowhawk. During the 'training,' Prince Azoun inexplicably shows up with a trailing trio of groundlings, transformed dwarf Zhentatium assassins. Artus and Azoun team up and tries to wait out the attack. However, things don't work out the way they are supposed to and Artus had to make a tough decision.Negatives:1. The Shadowhawk. I was really annoyed by Artus' father. His attitude really bothered me. But it's not a major problem.Positives:1. The story. The story was really solid. I couldn't find a big problem with the story at all.2. Characters. Everyone was a well thought out and interesting. The interactions between each character, father-son and Artus and Azoun, were perfect.Overall: 4.5/5*Another really good story. Fun all around.*Grandfather's Toys by Jean Rabe- A child is missing! Her grandfather, Drollo, enlists the aid of a druid, Galvin, to help find her. Drollo's tower however, is full of nooks and crannies where a little girl could hide. Filled with junk, the duo, along with the aid of a weasel named Elias, search the cluttered tower. However, the search goes farther than expected.Negatives:1. Rushed. The whole story was badly rushed. Everything was happening so fast that it was hard to really follow.2. Boring. Another story that fell flat on it's face. Even though it was a fast read, it just was a story I kept setting down.3. Undeveloped characters. The characters seemed like a joke. Drollo was constantly worrying and was all around useless. Galvin was interesting, but wasn't fully developed enough.Positives:1. Good idea. The story seemed like a good idea. Something pretty much different from the other stories. However it just wasn't executed very well.2. The ending. The happy ending was well done pretty good. Also, what Galvin gets as an reward was a great idea.Overall: 2/5*I'm being very nice about this grade.*The Curse of Tegea by Troy Denning- A horrible curse has fallen upon the village of Tegea and the villagers only hopes lay with two clerics of Mystra. The clerics, Adon and Corene, have to show the people of the village what truly lies beneath the villages exterior. Adon is a main character in The Avatar series.Negatives:1. The beginning. It started out kind of rough, but it picked up after a few pages.Positives:1. The story. The plot, the action, and the descriptions were near perfect. The plot was well thought out and executed perfectly. The ending was, I thought, done the way it should have been. The actions scenes were done superbly. The descriptions really made you picture the deformities.2. Characters. The characters in the story were great. I like Adon and he put everything upon his shoulders. Corene was really only a minor character, but she really felt like she was more of a central character at times. That sounds bad, but it worked fine. The tavern keeper's daughter, Sarafina, eluded a sense of pride even when faced with the hatred of the village. I liked how she stood for herself.3. The villain. The way that the duke of Tegea was written made you just want to hate him. That's probably the first villain that I truly hated.Overall: 4.9/5*Near perfect short story. Just wish that the beginning could have been a little more clearer*Dark Mirror by R. A. Salvatore- Drizzt Do'Urden helps a group of farmers track down some captives from a small farming village, Pengallen. Among the captives, Drizzt learns about ways that people view things and that not everything is evil from an unlikely source. Drizzt Do'Urden is one of the most recognizable characters in the Forgotten Realms and his story is written in The Legend of Drizzt.Negatives:None. It was a well written story that combined real life issues and some philosophy into it.Positives:1. First Person. I did like the viewpoint. It was executed better in this story than with the previous story, Patronage. You actually get into the mind of one of the best known Forgotten Realms heroes.2. Philosophical, psychological, and sociological. The whole talk between Drizzt and Nojheim carries many things in philosophy, psychology and sociology. The views people have towards things and other's and how they stay the same and change was wonderfully done.3. Drizzt. If you ever read any story featuring him, you would understand why he is a positive!Overall: 5/5*Wonderfully story with actually meaning you can take with you.*Afterward by Jeff Grubb- Basically tells of the minds behind the Forgotten Realms. Enjoyable if you want to learn about the 'secret' history of the Realms.OVERALL ANTHOLOGY: 4/5"},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"James Lowder, ed., Realms of Valor (TSR, 1993)Realms of Valor was the first short story collection to showcase the continuing adventures of various well-known personages in the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons world of the Forgotten Realms (a second, Realms of Infamy, appeared later). Each of the stories is written by someone who was instrumental in the creation of the original characters, e.g. Scott Ciencin, who wrote parts of the Avatar Trilogy under the name Richard Awlinson, gives us a tale about Adon, the priest from the adventuring party in those books, and Robert Salvatore brings back Drizzt Do'Urden, who's spent time on the New York Times bestseller list on quite a few occasions over the past decade.The book's probably not a starting point for reading about the Realms, but for those who have a few series' worth under their belts, it's great to see one's old friends again. The stories, in general, live up to the novels that introduced the various characters within. They do so well enough, in fact, that some characters with which the reader might not yet be familiar may inspire the more industrious reader to go looking for the books that the characters came from. Very good stuff. ***"},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"This is a good bunch of stories that can introduce you to the best Realms authors out there. I was not familiar with some of the authors. This book can give you an opportunity to sample some new authors and maybe check out their work. I did."},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"This is an oldie but goodie! Borrowed from my brother, I was truly excited to read this book again.

Then do a review so others may hear."},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"This book was relatively simple to read front to back. I enjoyed the stories very much, as they only took up no more then thirty pages an author. This book expresses a broad scope of literary imagination, involving everything from curious halflings to zealous religious enemies and everything in between. The stories are (overall) well written and simple in language. None of the stories seem to mirror another, so each story will feel like a new and different adventure. The reason this book gets four out of five stars is because I diddnt feel it needed to be as easy as it turned out to be. If the content were to be slightly more geared to adults, I would have readily jumped on the ideas for my own campaign adventures.Perhaps what drew me to read this would be the last story by R.A.Salvatore and his infamous Drow character, Drizzt. I would have thought I would treat the stories leading up to that one like previews for trite movies at the cineplex that you can't fast forward or skip through. I would prove myself wrong on that, as there was plenty of humor, tricks, and clever situations that caught and held my attention. If you play the Forgotten Realms campaign, or just read the stories, you would have fun with this book both ways."},{"Title":"Realms of Valor (A Collection of Short Stories)","review":"ok, i only read 3 of the stories so far, so dont count my rating. the one with drizzt was unbelievably boring though, as was the one with arilyn. the really cool one was &quot;the last drink&quot; by christie golden which had the vampire elf jander summerstar, who is really cool. i liked that story.....:)"},{"Title":"The Self-Help Paradox: Revolutionary Healing Through the Wisdom of a Course in Miracles","review":"The Self-Help Paradox is a very &quot;reader-friendly&quot; book. The author includes interesting and personal anecdotes that help illustrate the points he is making. The suggestions he makes are descriptions of what we CAN DO, rather than what not to do. This approach is very helpful and keeps the tone of the book very positive. The book is written in a way that I can focus on a particular aspect, a trouble spot for me, and concentrate on just that one part of my spiritual journey. I am on my second reading of The Self-Help Paradox and am utilizing it as a guide and helpful reminder of what I want and need to be focusing on currently.

Yet his contribution to what is now the United States of America is little known or appreciated as it ought to be, most likely because he was a loyalist. Without his contribution to the British victory over France in North America, the United States simply would not exist. Flexner provides us with a biography of this man that avoids the pitfalls of some of the exagerated Johnson legends by careful historical research.From the complicated family life of a man who never married his children's mothers, to his intricate involvement and dealings with the Iroquis Confederacy that held that Confederacy to the British side, Flexner presents a fascinating story of a side of American history many Americans are probably not aware of. You can not fully understand and appreciate American history without knowing about Sir William Johnson."},{"Title":"Mohawk Baronet: A Biography of Sir William Johnson (Iroquois and Their Neighbors)","review":"Sir William Johnson, the greatest frontiersman of the American Colonial period, defied all of the stereotypes that we typically associate with the term. Rather than a rough hewn log cabin, he inhabited a feudal manor. In place of the proto-democratic individualism of our mythologized frontiersmen, he epitomized the clannish feudalism of his native Ireland. And rather than being a noted Indian slayer, he was an adopted Mohawk sachem, a chief both in war and peace, and one of the Native's greatest friends among the whites.Johnson ranks among the most important men of the entire Colonial period, rivaled in fame and influence only by Benjamin Franklin. He earned honor and respect from two worlds; made a Baronet for his service to England as the Crown's Indian Superintendent, and made a chief of the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois Confederation. His keen understanding of the strategic importance of the Natives to the balance of power in North America and his mastery of Indian diplomacy made him the single most important man to the victory of British Arms in America during the French and Indian War. Had he not died in 1774, on the eve of the American Revolution, he likely would have been a crucial, if not deciding figure in that conflict as well.James Thomas Flexner, who is best known for his outstanding, four volume biography of George Washington, here handles the fascinating life of Sir William Johnson just as brilliantly. From his prologue to his final sentence he grabs and holds the readers attention, weaving a gripping tale that is also illuminating history. He makes a strong case for Johnson's preeminent importance to the development of Colonial America and even to the eventual formation of The United States. Anyone with an interest in Colonial America, The French and Indian Wars, or The Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederation should consider this book a must read. It receives my very highest recommendation.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"I have read practically everyone in sci-fi and to me, there are a few standouts, like: Robert Heinlen, Andre Norton, Murray Leinster, and A.E. Van Vogt. This is a great story if you appreciate early sci-fi circa 1951. I would also suggest his book, \\"War Against The Rull\\". If you are going to look for this book, \\"Weapon Shops of Isher\\", try to get the Ace Double-D version with Murray Leinster's \\"Gateway To Elsewhere\\" included. A two books in one issue. Pretty rare and you'll pay for it."},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"In \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher\\", AE van Vogt deals with libertarian philosophy that is best summarized by the slogan he attributes to the weapon shops, \\"The right to buy weapons is the right to be free\\". Unlike what many potential readers might imagine, this is not a manifesto for the National Rifle Association. It's a much more soft pedalled carefully considered cautionary tale that is a warning to citizens to be sure they retain the ability to limit the potential power of any government regardless of the form it might take.Time travel, immortality, the limitation of government power, corruption, invisibility, loyalty, naivete, love, courage, freedom, rebellion, powerful weaponry - all these themes and more are touched on in what many people call a fine example of the golden age of science fiction. But - and I'm willing to admit that perhaps the shortcoming is my own - I frankly failed to understand the charm and I didn't really catch the message. It bothers me to no end when I get to the end of a story and my sole reaction is \\"Huh ... what just happened?\\"Certainly I understood the basic themes but I felt that van Vogt missed the mark. The story line was difficult to follow and consisted of a hodge-podge of disconnected outrageous scientific conjectures, stilted dialogue far worse than sub-title translations of Japanese B-movies, blinding plot jumps and the use of plot devices that seemed arbitrary and pointless (Hedrock's immortality and a gambler with luck that defies all imagination, for example).In \\"Voyage of the Space Beagle\\", van Vogt wrote a series of stories that were clearly the predecessors of today's much loved Star Trek series. As a fan of classic science fiction, a lover of Star Trek in all its incarnations and a reader who has enjoyed van Vogt's other works, I wanted very much to like \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher\\". A cynical world-weary friend of mine put it well, \\"Vast ideas, but only half-vast execution!\\" Four stars for the ideas, two stars for the writing and the story to support it - call it three stars and suggest that this is a book which would be enjoyed only by hard core classic sci-fi lovers.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"Sounds like a blurb from the NRA, but in fact this slogan is one of the lynch-pins of one of the most complicated and headlong adventures that van Vogt (often called the master of the re-complicated story) ever wrote.The Weapon Shops, like many of his stories, was actually written and published as several stories before being collected and somewhat edited into book form. In this case, the major portions were published as \\"The Seesaw\\" (Astounding, July 1941), \\"The Weapon Shop\\" (Astounding, Dec 1942), and \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher (Thrilling Wonder Stories, Feb. 1949). It is important to note the age of these stories, written as they were during the so-called \`Golden Age' of science fiction, when ideas were far more important than character or great prose style. This book is absolutely replete with ideas, but the prose, dialogue, and character development certainly leave something to be desired when compared to modern novels. While reading this book you need to let the story line and ideas overwhelm you, and ignore some of the more blatant excesses in writing style.It starts with a Weapon Shop magically appearing in a 1950 neighborhood. When a policeman attempts to open its door, he finds it locked - but when a newspaperman tries it just a minute later, it opens - and the newspaperman finds himself in the Isher Empire, which has been around for 4700 years, and where the Weapon Shops effectively form the \`opposition' to this government. This is plot thread number one. The second thread is that of a young man wishing to leave his provincial village and make his fortune in the big city - where he finds that he is a \`callidetic giant', able to beat any game of chance, and ends up amassing a fortune so large that he can upset the economic stability of the Empire. Thread three involves the world's only immortal, Robert Hedrock, who was instrumental in establishing both the Empire and the Weapon Shops, the first to provide a stable form of government, the second to ensure that the Empire can neither stagnate nor become an unopposed dictatorship. Stir in invisibility, time travel, and the secret of faster-than-light propulsion and you have an explosive mix that will keep you turning pages as fast as you can (and don't you dare think about the plausibility of any of this!).I think I first read this book around 1960, when I was about twelve, and many of the images of this book made a large impression on me: the casinos and their very futuristic gambling machines, the giant computer that kept track of all the vital statistics of every person in the solar system, the idea of waging war by shifting in time, the \`brothels' of the day, even the \`energy weapons' that the Weapon Shops sold. Reading it today, these same items still fascinate - and the ending is still an explosive bang.The thematic point of the right to have weapons strong enough to protect the individual from any government excesses is a major one, and certainly was very topical when it was written at the height of WWII. However, this point is not examined very closely for its downside, because in the story such weapons could \`sense' whether or not the person purchasing it had the appropriate mental outlook - an easy way out of the problems seen by today's society with too many weapons freely available to almost anyone.This is possibly his strongest novel, certainly at least as good as his Slan and The World of Null-A, as here all the various ideas and plot threads do seem to come together in a cohesive whole, something that could not be said about a lot of his works. And it is a pell-mell, head-over-heels, fun and fascinating read.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"This book and its sequel &quot;The Weapon Makers&quot;,together make up one of the best old sci fi series. It's astonishingly inventive, especially politically. The tale is smoother and better told than some of van Vogt's work- on the whole, I'd say that only &quot;The War Against the Rull&quot; comapres to it.

Both the Empire that rules the galaxy and the Weapon Shops that oppose it are the creations of a single immortal being. This is not a page-one sort of statement, you have to read your way through the marvels of the weapon shops, the glitterbling of the casino, the allure of the brothels and the omniscient computers that run the show.At the time of the narration, the Empire is 4700 years old: there's a lot of stability in this revolutionary battle. What happens to the reader is that as the political tension fades, the story of the young, supernaturally lucky young man who leaves the boonies to seek his fortune in the capital comes to the fore.So this is only partly a story about weapons and freedom.

The rebels are fronted by weapon shops because they, like many libertarians today, believe that personal liberty is expressed by by the right to bear arms (ie, the right to defend yourself from criminals, even if they are governments). By the end, however, we have almost no glimpse of the illicit society. A modest look at the totalitarian one. And almost none of the philosophical underpinnings. But that's typical Alfred Elton van Vogt. His works are often vague and mystifying.Reportedly, van Vogt exploited his dreams for some of his plotting which may explain why this one unfolds in a dreamlike way, morphing from one setting into another, often winding up in fantastical environs. Unfortunately, in this case, the story meanders around the periphery of the conflict between the monarchy and the weapons shops.Here, like in too many of his stories, van Vogt's characters are blanks without depth or personality. All they do is justify the quotation marks. (The exceptions are van Vogt's supermen, who exude confidence, and his alien creatures, who are generally primitive and animal whatever their technological level.)Probably because van Vogt wasn't a trained scientist, he blithely took science to the n-th degree -- a million million years into the past, a gigantic floating store, immortals, etc. Such concepts were new and daring when van Vogt began writing.In the end, like many of his other stories, this one moves quickly. Probably due to his system of stringing together 800-word mini-dramas to form the whole.I almost never remember a van Vogt plot. But I do remember that is was a good ride. And I'm surprised and delighted that for the fraction of his writing life devoted to the weapon shops, van Vogt spoke libertarian."},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"This book contains little if any violence but it serves,to remind one and all. of why the second amendment exists, to allow the populace to defend it'self against the G'ovt."},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"One for the Social Historians to pore over: otherwise, a rollicking yarn, and a worthy addition to reading material for acolytes of the National Rifle Association."},{"Title":"Certain Finkelmeyer","review":"\\"A Certain Finkelmeyer\\" is the story of a Russian-Jewish poet who is unable to publish his works because of his Jewish heritage. So, he publishes them as translations from an obscure Siberian language and finds a Tongor tribesman to be his \\"poet.\\" He is discovered by a patent expert whose mistress is the patroness of the underground art scene, and Finkelmeyer enters a Bohemian world of artists, writers, and hangers-on. While sometimes comical, the artists' circle struck me as very prentenious, if not downright affected. Ultimately, they would have been utterly tedious if the reader didn't feel sympathy for their plight under Soviet persecution. It is entirely possible that Roziner's writing style only amplified these impressions.The book is told in a series of flashbacks or throwbacks that alternate with the progress of the main plot. I found the prose to be overwritten and overenthusiastic at times. It was like the pages of the book were shouting at me.So, why read this book? It does provide a good portrait of the antisemitism and philistinism that pervaded the Soviet Union, especially official circles under Stalin and Khrushchev (era of the antisemitic Doctors' Plot and violent anti-modernism). The book shows how peaceful internationalists, acting in the name of all the peoples and workers of the world, were crass bigots. They twisted their logic to suit their discriminatory practices. Moreover, their ideas about art were ridiculous: only the Party can deem something art, and to claim to be an artist or a poet without the Party's designation is a serious crime of bougeois arrogance. The chapters on the show trial of \\"a certain Finkelmeyer\\" for daring to proclaim himself a poet are worth reading.Read this novel, ignore the overblown style, and be glad that the Soviet regime and its leadership are dead."},{"Title":"The Art of Hunting Big Game in North America","review":"This is an informative book filled with good advice and a good story line to keep a reader intrested. I feel this is a classic book of outdoor literature. This is a great book for young readers intrested in the sport of hunting."},{"Title":"The Art of Hunting Big Game in North America","review":"Over the years, the classic outdoor writers have slowly disappeared and new readers to the genre mostly end up consuming a blander variety of writing that neither entertains nor does justice to the beauty of the outdoors. True to form, Jack O'Connor's writing flies in the face of modern-day, latte-sipping, rainbow-festooned, armchair environmentalists. Although the main objective here is to describe the challenges and successes that can be found in the different game species hunted, the author doesn't once apologize for his activities nor does he glorify the act of hunting. Readers familiar with this author will recognize his style that combines folk storytelling with scientific naturalism, and social anthropology. In this book, O'Connor takes the reader across early and mid-20th century America and takes us along to view the panoramas and byways of a time and place that has long disappeared in most places. His characterization of the peoples, places, and experiences will jar the vegetarian and new Agers but his writing remains true to an American tradition that doesn't try to hide the realities of life and death. Although he never wavers in his respect for game, there is no mistaking that the reader must understand the struggle between the hunter and the hunted. In this careful study, one learns of the various firearms, the hunting techniques, and the knowledge required to successfully hunt the big game species of North America from Canada into Mexico and across the heartland. Jack O'Connor provides the neophyte and veteran alike with lessons that any hunter or naturalist will appreciate. As the new media conglomerates give the public a politically correct, homogenized version of acceptable 'outdoor experiences', books like this one help us maintain the ties that have bound us to nature since the rise of humanity."},{"Title":"The Art of Hunting Big Game in North America","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

A valuable asset to counselors and to all those who wish to explore the subject of love and infatuation. . ."},{"Title":"Urgent Longings: Reflections on Infatuation, Intimacy and Sublime Love","review":"Infatuation has often been regarded as a pathological state by mainstream psychology. In his book \\"Urgent Longings\\" Tyrrell, an experienced practising psychologist, puts forward the thesis that far from being a psychopathology infatuation is a natural and necessary step in the development of mature, meaningful relationships. Tyrrell investigates the connections between infatuation, emotional and sexual repression, spiritual awareness and psychosocial and psycho-sexual development. Infatuation can be at once a blissful as well as painful experience which most of us go through during adolescence. The experience of first love often bears the marks of infatuation and has the power to shape our relationships ever after. Tyrrell provides insight into this crucial stage of our psychological development in a sensitive, spiritual and profoundly human way which offers much to the academic as well as the lay reader.

Enough to identify who he had been in the first war against Sumeral, and they are not happy memories for him.Peppered throughout with little observations full of wisdom on the cost of war, these books are well written and enjoyable. This brings together all the threads of the previous books as the Orthlund, Fyorlund and Riddin people all march against Sumeral's second coming and into the mist shrouded land of Narsindal.Hawklan finds some unexpected allies in his quest into Narsindal and the \\"small and ancient\\" thing prophesised by the dying king in book 1 which destroys Sumeral in the end may not be what you think.This series of books called \\"the chronicles of Hawklan\\" form the centrepiece of Roger Taylors world spanning series of fantasy novels. There are a number of other books which feed in an indirect way into this same story. All the books come together for their conclusion to the overall story in \\"the return of the sword\\" which in reality can be said to be the true end to The Chronicles of Hawklan.While these books could be classified as sword and sorcery they are well written with likeable and well drawn characters that you feel sympathy for. The political systems of all the lands involved are well thought out and they all have a history dating back to at least the first war against Sumeral. Even if you don't read The Return of the Sword, this book provides as satisfying conclusion to this sequence of books."},{"Title":"Latin suffixes","review":"The author did an admirable job in 1858 of organizing Latin vocabulary by theirsuffixes. He explains a multitude of suffixes, and provides definitions with each word, so I never feel that he is hiding the answers (as do many other schoolbooks).He intends that each suffix will provide a \\"key to the meaning of each word,\\" and that these keys will make it much easier to understand and remember them. I find this approach helpful in small doses.As for the reprint itself, I was disappointed by the meager dimensions, which I hadn't checked before ordering. My copy measures 8.0\\" by 5.0\\" by 3/8\\". The typeface is small, perhaps 6 point. It would have been easy (I believe) to print the book with larger, more readable type, and in a size with wider margins for annotations.Why not improve on the methods of the 1850's, instead of merely trying to duplicate them?"},{"Title":"A Fable of Modern Art","review":"Ashton's enquiry into the linkages of Modernism's prime suspects is swift and decisive. The paradigm is established early, the dilemna espoused at the birth of modernism by one of its advocates, Balzac, in his novel, 'The Unknown Masterpiece'. Cezanne, Rilke, Kandinsky and old 'sexy pants,' Picasso are combed over and fitted to Ashton's enmeshing tale. A French flick,Jacques Rivette's,'La Belle Noiseuse', of the early 90s made an excellent stab at filming Balzac's novel in contemporary garb. Its drawn out enactment of the creative process has only been surpassed by Tarakovsky. The coincidental advent of these two revisions could be regarded as a railing against the prevailing ethical vaccuum in the visual arts: a time when pastiche and design, and digital morphing have drowned complexity, structure, spatial issues & the hand crafted disciplines - not to venture notions of enchantment or 'spirituality' which post-modern agendas seem bereft of. Perhaps we are already staring from the terrors of the abyss, referred to regularily in the text. The balancing act between abstraction and mimesis, between chaos and surplus information, individual vision and profound feeling of the heart, the role of Nature's laws governing the arts, the emphasis on process above content; Ashton eloquently articulates the crucial growth nodes of Modernism. The ironic footer to this resides in the caption,'Unknown.' Balzac's book is likely 'unknown' as is the aforementioned film, and lastly, Ashton's marvellous analysis, which might spur the art novice with a set of useful questions.

I'm not sure I could have appreciated them as a younger reader. There is an old-world feel to the writing, and I'm sure modern audiences may scoff, but I find myself looking forward to the hidden humor that sometimes makes me snort tea out my nose. The fairy story and the adventures of the children are light and entertaining, but my favorite thing about this book is the unexpected humor delivered in that wide-eyed, innocent manner that makes me wonder if the author would be surprised to find out she was saying something funny.I found these books because of an interview with one of my favorite female fantasy authors when she was describing her investigation into women as fantasy writers.

And the end of the book wraps up with very little changed in the world or in the characters.Too much \\"the fisherman and his wife\\", too little magical whimsical effect.Along with some other readers, I found this book by following references from Edward Eager.

She tells her story with wit and humour, and interjects sly digs that engender a wink and a smile, but while the premise is timeless and interesting, the prose is extremely dated, making the book a bit tedious to read for any length of time. Also, the ideas and prejudices exhibited by the characters date the material.The five siblings of the title, who have found a Sand-fairy willing to grant them one wish a day, continually make silly wishes that get them into trouble. Their first wish is to be \\"as beautiful as the day\\". Right there you get a sense of the book's outdated charm. This is of interest more as a tribute to a talented children's writer of a bygone era rather than for its own sake.I wanted to enjoy this classic, but I found it hard slogging through. That is just my opinion, however, but I'd suggest you read a bit of the text before purchasing it unless you're already familiar with, or particularly interested in, author Nesbit.Caveat: The occasional black-and-white line drawings are by H.R. Millar, not the Paul Zelinsky watercolors promised in the Editorial Reviews section."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"A bunch of kids in England move from the big smoke to the country. After they get there, they discover a bizarre grumpy weird looking supernatural guy.Due to various rigmarole, this discovery means that said oddity grants them a bunch of wishes. Being kids, they generally wish for kids adventure type stuff."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"I have to admit that I bought this book because I read in an interview with J.K. Rowling that E. Nesbit is one of her favorite authors, and this is Nesbit's most famous book. Sadly though, Five Children and It doesn't hold a candle to the Harry Potter books. They're not even worth comparing.That said, this is a cute, (very) juvenile book. The narrator has a pleasant, personable way of addressing the readers. And the book provides an interesting look into the personalities of early 20th cantury Brittish children.There's little plot, however. The book is more a collection of short stories than a novel, as each chapter tells a different tale, and there is little connection between them. This seem to me to have been a very easy book to write.I'd recommend this book for early readers (first-third grade). Older kids and adults look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"This 1902 fantasy, a gift from my parents when I was in fourth or fifth grade, features an irritable Psammead whom Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother dig up in a sand pit. Then the magic begins. The sand-fairy does not like granting wishes, and his misshapen body with bat's ears and snail's eyes bloats when he does. The wishes, lasting only until sunset, all take unexpected, funny turns.The sand-fairy and other personalities and Victorian details render the magic entirely real-world, believable. This was my favorite children's book and I relived the delight when I found a copy to share with my own children. That this volume is illustrated by one of my favorite people from one of my favorite families triples the delight.The book is too challenging for independent reading for children under 10, but it's a great read-aloud for small children, as are the classics of Frank Baum, E.B. White and C.S. Lewis.Edith Nesbit was like J. K. Rowling a single mother in need of a means to support her children. Her books in their era were as popular as Harry Potter in this one. Some of her observations are surprisingly humane. Nesbit's treatment of a clan of Gypsies, for example, transcends the deep prejudice of her time. Not to worry, the book is not preachy or teachy. It's just grand, eloquent fun. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"I came upon E. Nesbit relatively late in life. I was a 20-something grad student when I found out that the &quot;Bastables&quot; referred to in C. S. Lewis' &quot;The Magicians Nephew&quot; were the children in an E. Nesbit book. Shortly after that, I found a copy of &quot;Five Children and It&quot; and eagerly read it.I love E. Nesbit.She writes in a way that is intelligent, snappy, and funny - at least to an adult. There are a lot of little side jokes in the book that seem to be aimed at the parent reading the book. I do think her books may be funnier to grown-ups looking back at childhood than they are to actual children.And I'm afraid that many of today's children, made into literalists by the media and generally not appreciative of complex, &quot;archaic&quot; or &quot;overly British&quot; (at least among American kids) language may not get it. Which is a pity, really. The Nesbit stories are so good - so imaginative, so full of good use of language. I have read a number of her stories, but I think this is my favorite. It is basically an expansion of the old saying &quot;Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it&quot;. Five children find a Sand-Fairy (or Psammead) that can grant them wishes. But the sand fairy is a cranky literalist, who interprets the wishes of the children just as they are and wild things happen (e.g., the children wish for great beauty, and then the people around them don't recognize them). This is an extremely entertaining book. Unfortunately, I suspect it may be beyond some of today's youngsters who tend to lack patience with complex or older language."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"With the surging popularity of Lemony Snicket's, \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", the time has never been better to gently urge children towards those literary classics that sound so mightily similar to their beloved Baudelaire sagas. And of the great children's authors that employed direct narration, few are so wonderful yet rarely remembered as the fantastic Edith Nesbit. The woman who single-handedly redefined the whole kid-fantasy genre. As the Books of Wonder edition of \\"Five Children and It\\" is quick to point out, until Nesbit happened along, children's fantasy novels either took place in some \\"far-off fantasy-land (Alice to Wonderland; Dorothy to Oz)\\" or simply began and ended in their own magical world (The Princess and the Goblin, for example). No one had really explored normal every day children stumbling across magic. And that, of course, brings us to the fabulous, \\"Five Children and It\\". Written in Nesbit's trademark snarky Edwardian style, the tale remains as amusing to children today as it did back in the early 20th century. I remember it fondly from my own tender youth, and since I'm only 27 that should certainly say something.Now there were once five city children. The eldest was Cyril and the youngest was simply referred to as \\"the Lamb\\", since it was only a baby and was dearly adored and spoiled by its family. One summer the children have the delightful opportunity to be left in a seaside house with only their servants to care for them. While exploring the grounds of their new home, the kids come across a strange furry creature in their local gravel pit. It has extended eyes like a snail, the ears of a bat, monkey hands and feet, and a big furry spiderish body. It is, of course, a Psammead (or Sand-fairy) and the kids have a chance to make one wish a day. In your normal Edwardian novel, this might be a good thing and the kids might have delightfully boring adventures for the rest of the book. Not here. The Psammead, you see, is a bit of a jerk. A self-satisfied eternally complaining jerk. And whatsoever the children wish for, be it wings or money, somehow their wishes have a tendency to go awry. Still, when you've a whole summer before you and a pile of wishes waiting to be made, life can get very interesting indeed.To my mind, Nesbit's best book is without question, \\"The Phoenix and the Carpet\\". That said, this is an excellent companion to it. Now I had the pleasure of reading an edition with the original Millar illustrations when I was young. And if you're a fan of pen and ink, that could certainly be a nice choice. But if you want an edition that's really going to get your children's attention, try the Books of Wonder publication with illustrations by Paul O. Zelinsky. Zelinsky, as it notes in the back of the book, had a great deal of difficulty drawing the Psammead since Millar's own version was uncommonly faithful to Nesbit's description. Nonetheless, Zelinsky has the advantage of color and full page spreads. So when the children acquire beautiful rainbow colored wings, you see them here in all their showy glory. Better still are the tiny black and white illustrations on the book's inside covers that show multiple amusing scenes from the book.And as for Nesbit herself, none can compare. She employs the tone of a conspirator towards her child readers. Often adults are ridiculed for being too blunt and unimaginative to understand what's being said here. The book teems with plots that would be later employed and stolen by such future authors as C.S. Lewis and (more obviously) Edward Eager. In fact, as a kid I often got Eager and Nesbit mixed up in my head. Some critics of this tale sigh with great moans that the kids here don't talk like kids today. Well lah-de-dah. The children in the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip don't talk like kids today either. Shall we just go chuck all of Charles Schultz's work into the Boston Harbor and forget he ever existed? Ladies and gentlemen, we simply cannot go about condemning classic children's books because our slang has changed. Kids today will still love \\"Five Children and It\\" and they'll adore its ridiculous plotting. If anything is dated about this book it's the truly odd moments of racism in it. Though Nesbit is to be applauded for giving gypsies a fair shake, the same cannot be said for American Indians. The British obsession with Native Americans is as puzzling now as it was then. So you should at least know that there's one chapter in this book that, if you don't particularly care for Edwardian stereotypes, can be easily skipped past if you so choose. Or not. It's entirely up to you.In any case, this is a fine fine tale. They don't hardly make \`em like this no more (though they certainly try to). A tip of the hat to Ms. Nesbit for all that she has done for children's literature. And a tip of the hat to every kid today that picks the book up for a lark. A memorable tale."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"This is one of those classic bits of children's literature that is fun and funny and allows for a little magic without anything frightening or age-inappropriate. I found the free Kindle edition to be an easy read and fairly error/typo free.For a brief summary:4 children (the fifth is their baby brother) stumble upon a sand fairy that has the power to grant wishes. They naturally don't really think through their wishes and so all kinds of mayhem, trouble, and sometimes fun comes out of each day. If you have a young reader at home (say 7-12) who enjoys fantasy and literature and is stealing your brand new Kindle from you, then this would be a great option to put on it to keep said Kindle-thief occupied."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"I discovered this book in fourth or fifth grade and went on to patiently track down everything else by E. Nesbit. Rereading it, I'm still struck by her boundless imagination, sharp wit, and dead-on dialogue. The heroes of the story are real kids with real personalities - rare even now, much less in a Victorian children's novel. Many scenes make me laugh even at the upteenth reading, such as when the kids have to think up &quot;Red Indian&quot; names on the fly and come up with Panther, Squirrel, and Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police. I suppose some passages are a little sophisticated for some readers, but most kids today are already familiar with British turns of phrase through the Harry Potter books and should not have much trouble with this one. In fact, I would strongly recommend Five Children and It to anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter books, as it offers a similar blend of magic, adventure, humor, and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"My older brother started reading me this book when I was six. I couldn't wait for story time any longer, took the book away from him and read it for myself cover to cover in one sitting. This book brings fantasy to life...who could imagine a downside to being suddenly a grownup, or &quot;beautiful as the day&quot;? I still have thoughts of the Psammead trying to stay out of the rain every time I pass a sand pit or quarry.It was a fantastic fairy tale then and it is today. I am ordering a copy for my infant daughter, but perhaps it's also for me too..."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"E. Nesbit's classic story of about some Edwardian children who find a sand fairy one summer is an unsentimental delight. Each day the odd fairy grants them one magic wish, be it beauty, wealth, great size, etc. which will only last until sunset. Somehow each wish they make turns into a disaster, but through their own cleverness and a bit of luck, the children are able to make each problem work out in the end. Nesbit's writing is particularly full of amusing asides and offbeat humor in this one. Her turns of plot are inventive, and as the plucky children face their outlandish predicaments, it becomes clear that Nesbit has her finger on the pulse of the way real children might think. Her work has held up quite well considering it is over a hundred years old. This novel would be suitable for kids in about fourth or fifth grade."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"I have to admit that this book has an odd title. The \\"Five Children\\" part is easy enough to figure out - that refers to Robert, Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and their adorable young brother who has the pet name \\"the Lamb\\". But what on earth is \\"It\\"? As it turns out, \\"It\\" is a Sand-fairy, or Psammead. And like the title, the Psammead is odd. \\"It\\" is small, round and furry with snail-like eyes and bat-like ears. But the Psammead's odd-ness is matched by its extraordinary potential. It has the power to grant one wish a day, lasting until sunset. And so when the five children stumble across this magical Psammead while playing in a gravel-pit, they quickly learn that wishes can come true!But the children soon discover that having your wishes come true is not always as pleasant as it might seem. Wishes for beauty and wealth result in an unexpectedly bitter after-taste that confirms that these much coveted wishes are not as grand as most people think. Other wishes lead to harrowing adventures, such as being in a beseiged castle, and being stalked by Indians. Still other wishes result in rather bizarre scenarios, such as having wings, being the size of a giant, or being grown-up. But in each case the children soon end up yearning for time of day when the wish will come to an end, as one of them remarks: \\"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset.\\"But as a reader of this tale, you'll find yourself quickly wishing for day-break, and for another exciting day to begin with another exciting wish to be fulfilled. This book may have been written about 100 years ago in 1902, but it hasn't lost any of its charm. When Edith Nesbit wrote this book (her first \\"magic\\" book) it was an instant success. It is equally beloved today - and with good reason! The magical adventures are full of charm and excitement. Yet they convey important moral lessons, such as the transitory nature of beauty and wealth - &quot;neither had exactly made them happy.\\" Generally speaking each chapter features a new wish and a new adventure that lasts until sunset. It's a great read-a-loud book for young children, guaranteed to enthral and please with its wonderful blend of magic, adventure, and humor. I must warn you that when the book does come to an end, you will be disappointed. But only because it means the end of the children's enthralling magical adventures! To have a book that can have such an effect - now that is a wish come true!"},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"This book is one of my favourites. I purchased it last fall, and since that time, I have read it numerous times. Edith Nesbit has a certain way in which she explains and writes things. I love how descriptive she is. As she deals with these children, she adds a sense of humour to it, and to see these children go through all the wishes, and each one of them turn out sour, it is really rather humourous.

It made me feel like I was right there in Old England and I was right there in every one of their adventures. They had so much trouble with each wish.

My only criterion is that I am not crazy about the way the English speak during that period. I have a hard time understanding them, sometimes. But there is no doubt that I just loved the whole book.

The overall story line does not have much of a plot, but each chapter is quirky, fun, and fairly quickly-paced. I got plenty of chuckles out of it, and my children certainly enjoyed reading it on their own; the unpredictable nature of fulfilled wishes kept us guessing, and the fact that all of the children in the story ended up safely at home each night meant that this was a great bedtime read.

Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane live in a countryside mansion replete with servants, they take trips to toy stores where they can buy whatever their hearts desire (the author informs us that this is the way children ought to be brought up), and inside a gravel-pit they have found a prehistoric sand-fairy that grants them wishes, one each day, but all their wishes have been turning out rotten so far. Well, boo hoo.It isn't the concept that bothers me; it is the execution. Baum's and Carroll's heroines face comparable situations, but neither authors' books evoked such negative reactions from me. The reasons why the children's wishes fail I found especially abominable: when peerless beauty is wished for, the maid won't let them in since they look like \\"eyetalian monkeys\\"; when wealth is asked for and antique guineas appear by the bushel, the kids are arrested for thieves; when stolen jewellery magically reappears, it is Beale, the gameskeeper, who is immediately and incontrovertibly the chief suspect; when the four wish (accidentally) for the baby to grow up, the Lamb (Or Devereuz, or Hilary, or St Maur, as he should be rightly called) becomes a snappish fop. Nesbit draws miscellaneous moralistic lessons from her tale (\\"I cannot pretend that stealing is right\\"), but what use are these lessons when you are arrested whether or not you tell the truth? I would much rather Nesbit turn a cynical eye on the people she is describing, instead of using her keen powers of observations to weave an antithetical yarn.At least her prose is reasonable enough. Nesbit's language is lucid, and while her sentence structure is rather sophisticated, it is not unduly so. Sadly, the same cannot be said of her characters. The four children who are the novel's protagonists are essentially the only developed characters, and while they are developed rather well, with plausibility and realism, they are bland. They are honest, noble, polite, friendly, sociable, and well-off; they treat the servants and people of lower station as functionaries, tools, ways of getting from A to B, and so does the author. Thus, there is little desire on the reader's part to come to know them better. They allow little conflict, little empathy. I'm probably the first to levy the charge that they have little wit and, if not for the fact that the wishes disappear at sundown, they would have great difficulty dealing with ther wishes.But more about those wishes: it is quite surprising how many of them are accidental. In fact, there is little premeditated wishing going on past chapter six: otherwise, Nesbit would have been hard-pressed to find a reason for the children to wish for marauding Indians. What lesson are we, as readers, to draw from this? \\"Word your wishes carefully?\\" I'm reminded of the movie \\"Big,\\" in where a twelve-year-old wishes to be grown-up to impress an older girl, and instead becomes Tom Hanks and scares the heck out of everybody. Just once I'd like a book where the characters get their hearts' true desires and have to come to terms with THAT."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"CRITICISM: I doubt that I have ever met any girls sillier than Jane, or more cloying than Anthea. Indeed, I have never met any more cowardly than the two of them put together. They fulfill the worst stereotypes of silly little girls, and I balk at having them be heroines in this story. They cry and worry at their brothers for trying to fight. If they want to stop the boys in the long run, they should learn to speak sensibly, or let the boys go to it and be beaten up a few times, instead of snivelling for mercy to the enemy. Nesbit's narrator has some humorous moments, but is too much of a prude to run with them, retreating instead into sneakily-injected lectures on child behavior.SUMMARY: Five children meet a sand-fairy (called a Psammead), who is by far the most sensible of the characters in this book. From there, the book devolves into a series of events in the \\"and then this happened, and then that happened\\" style.COUNTER RECOMMENDATIONS: For elementary age fantasy, try any Roald Dahl (\\"James and the Giant Peach\\" is quite marvelous, as are \\"Witches\\" and \\"BFG\\"). Also try Cornelia Funke's \\"Inkheart\\" or, if lengthy books are still a bit daunting, \\"Thief Lord.\\""},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"The genius of Kipling, of A. A. Milne, of Ian Fleming and of Enid Blyton is their ability to transcend age, to write in a way that, no matter the age of the reader, there is always something new to appreciate on re-reading. Sadly, Ms Nesbit does not come up to this standard. As a child, I adored her fantasies. As an adolescent, I rediscovered them while reading them to my brother, ten years younger, and found different depths in them. When my own children came along, I wanted to share with them the joy I had found previously, but instead I came to the realization that Ms Nesbit's political views permeate every paragraph of her works, and that they are written with the specific intent to indoctrinate young, impressionable minds with her Marxist doctrine.Whether dealing with the relationship between employer and employee, or the rle of monarchy in ancient civilizations, Ms Nesbit is out to showcase the wicked exploitation of the poor downtrodden masses by the wicked ruling classes.If you want your children to think for themselves, by all means have them read this book, But afterwards, for heaven's sake, talk about it with them, and make sure that they see clearly the outrageous fallacies of Marxism."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"Back when I was a ten-year-old delighting in Edward Eager's marvelously clever, funny books, I should have paid more attention to the fact that he slipped in references to E. Nesbit's works, and then I should have burned a path to the library to read them. But I didn't.I delayed this pleasure by nearly fifty years--but a pleasure it still was.Nesbit's young protagonists are real, three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood people--not stereotypical Victorian cardboard cutouts. They argue and get into mischief as would any children left to their own devices, but also show a depth of imagination and a sense of honor. Like all of Nesbit's children's books I have read so far, this story is saved from syrupy sweetness by its edgy dialogue and character development.\\"The Five Children and It\\" is a fantasy story for smart kids. Some young readers may be confused about the cultural references in it, so it would be an ideal read-along story for parents (who can answer children's questions about the everyday details of late-19th-century English culture) and their kids."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"This book is about Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother who discover a Psammead,or Sand-fairy, who agrees to grant the children one wish per day.Soon, their wishes start to turn quite unlike what they expected.Then, an accidental wish has terrible consequences, and the kidsare faced with a hard choice: to let an innocent man be chargedwith a crime, or to lose their gift of magical wishes.I read this book in one day, and I thought it was pretty good.This book turned out to be fairly interesting.I would probably read \\"Five Children and It\\" again."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"Point: Your most earnest wish may become a nightmare!

This creature is a sand-fairy! Long time ago and today, they could grant wishes to children. They could wish for anything they liked.

It's a little more demanding, perhaps, than most contemporary &quot;intermediate&quot; fiction, although it's possible that Harry Potter has opened some minds to the possibilities of this sort of fantasy. I would recommend the sand-fairy series to any child who loves Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Narnia, or the wry works of John Bellairs."},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"This book is a childhood favourite of mine, and has remained a favourite still. It is funny, enchanting, and above all highly entertaining. Unlike so many other books written in it's era, The Five Children and It does not attempt to preach or teach.

He hadn't been uncovered since the days of the dionsours, and had no idea about modern children, and their wishes. The sand fairy, the childern call \`It', says he will grant the children's wishes. The already peculiar looking fairy, puffs himself up, before granting wishes. He reluctantly agrees to grant one wish, per day, for one week.When wishes aren't planned out, they don't tend to go so well. With a wish for gold, a pile of gold appears, so large, it fills the sand pit. Although the children have pockets full of gold, they have to use their own pocket change, to make their purchases.An off-handed wish for everyone to like their baby brother, who they call the Lamb, results in a near kidnapping of the baby. A wish for a castle comes with guards carrying swords. Other wishes include Indians, who want to scalp the children, and jewels that are really stolen property. Lucky, or not, all wishes disappear at sunset.Five Children and It will both entertain you, and have you making your own wishes, that you are sure won't be revoked at sunset.Jill Ammon Vanderwoodchildren's author:Through the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)"},{"Title":"Five Children and It","review":"Books of Wonder once again brings a classic E. Nesbit tale back to life for readers young and all to enjoy. Brimming with fun and fantasy, as well as realistic, believeable story-telling, this is an adventure that will keep you guessing what will happen next.This adventure happens when five children (one still more of a baby) find a Psammead, or sand-fairy. They learn that this creature is capable of granting them wishes, although it asks that they only make wishes once a day. So the wishing begins, but the kids come to find that generally the wishes cause them more trouble than fun. Meanwhile, the Psammead seems perplexed, wondering why they don't wish for practical, solid things, rather than fanciful things, like castles, or high-concepts, like being wanted.This book is illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky, who also did the illustrations for \\"The Enchanted Castle,\\" also released by Books of Wonder. Like the book, these illustrations are an excellent blend of fantasy and reality. This book also includes an informative Afterword.I understand that \\"Five Children and It\\" also recently became a major motion picture.

But it's nearly all Western-oriented: blue-eyed blondes answering telephones, and that sort of thing. There's very little that can be used in developing countries, suited to the needs of development professionals, extension workers or health educators.The author (a professional illustrator) has put together an excellent collection of her own black-and-white line drawings. It concentrates on health, but also has illustrations of many other aspects of rural development in Asia, Africa and Latin America.I use it all the time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Where There Is No Artist: Development Drawings and How To Use Them","review":"I publish a bi-monthly newsletter on Africa and this book has been an enormous source of help.

I recommend this book wholeheartedly and it has now become the most important book in our office."},{"Title":"Broken Silence: Opening Your Heart and Mind to Therapy--A Black Woman's Recovery Guide","review":"Dr. Singleton prefaces the novel, Broken Silence, by quoting an axiom from a t-shirt she once saw: \\"Being a Black Woman Is One of the Hardest Jobs in the World.\\" She comments that this maxim has proven itself true as evidenced in the lives of her clients. Too often women of color hide behind walls of silence (with disastrous consequences), only turning to therapy when the burdens become too heavy to bear. I loved the way the author substantiated this point by citing the historical \\"silent suffering\\" experienced by African American slaves as fodder for pain; how religion is repeatedly viewed as the only means of relief; and how the \\"silent suffering\\" is still deeply rooted in the modern African American psyche.The middle portion of the book contains eight success stories of black women who have benefited from therapy. Each woman has different types of issues ranging from emotional and sexual abuse, relationship issues, and self-respect/identity problems. Dr. Singleton introduces each story with care and compassion. Her objectivity, presentation of the issues, and counsel to her patients are helpful, sound, and sensible. She has simplified highly complex problems which allow the reader to easily empathize and learn from the lessons of others. My only comment here is she might have over-simplified a bit too much, but her advice and strategies to minimize stress and encourage her clients are wonderful.I think this book is an excellent resource for women, especially black women, who need to know that they are not alone in their experiences with abuse, failed relationships, and/or career disappointments. It also provides clear explanations and warning signs along with practical suggestions and exercises for healthier living. It demonstrates that personal change is possible and helps women realize that if they choose to overcome the cultural stigma of therapy, they will find the support, comfort, relief, and balance needed to let the healing begin.Reviewed by Phyllis"},{"Title":"Broken Silence: Opening Your Heart and Mind to Therapy--A Black Woman's Recovery Guide","review":"This book is great beginning for women who are uncertain about whether they need to seek professional help! She really has captured the essence of Black women and their path to therapy. I have recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Broken Silence: Opening Your Heart and Mind to Therapy--A Black Woman's Recovery Guide","review":"Dr. Singleton's book is right on time for the African American woman of today, because as quiet as it's kept, we are hurting and need to be healed. As a 17 year old African American female I opened the book and from reading the first page I knew that it was not another one of those &quot;How-To&quot; books. We all know about the sudden trend in writing motivational books where the author has an eyecatching title like &quot;How To Heal Your Broken Soul With Five Easy and Totally Doable Steps!&quot;, written by some person who couldn't be further away from their target readers.Dr. Singleton's book is far from anything like that. This book is real and with every chapter dedicated to another hurt and troubled Black woman, the reader can relate to one,if not two or three of the women. This book is not just for middle-aged Black woman.It is for any woman of any age.&quot;Broklen Silence&quot; is simply put and can be read in no time, and even if you find that every chapter is not aplicable to you, each reader should find Singleton's ending 10 Priciples of Affirmation.Thank you for writing this book Dr. Singleton.There is someone of my generation out here reading it."},{"Title":"Broken Silence: Opening Your Heart and Mind to Therapy--A Black Woman's Recovery Guide","review":"Broken Silence is an exceptional book that I found to be very captivating. I am an African-American male and I believe that every &quot;brother&quot; should read this book, and gain an understnading of the women in their lives as well as themselves. We all have loved ones, friends or co-workers who at some time in their life will go through a period of emotional or psychic distress and will need guidance to successfully cope with the situation. All too often the women in our lives suffer in silence, hence the title of the book.In the preface, Dr. Singleton stated that she had to undergo therapy herself as part of her training and found it to be an unpleasant experience. This helps to explain part of the reason for so much resistance in our community towards therapy, especially if the therapist comes from another cultural background. Dr. Singleton manages to combine therapy with good old-fashioned wisdom and thereby gain the trust of those who have come to her for help.Eight women are profiled in the book, a representative sample of the thousands of people Dr. Singleton has assisted over the years. Dr. Singleton shows in each different situation, how to turn a negative experience into one of empowerment and triumph. Pychological counseling is not an easy process and it takes a lot of time and hard work, just like in any good relationship. As I read this book, it brought to mind a movie I saw last year, the Antwone Fisher Story. I saw men who were moved to tears by that film and this book could have the same impact.This culture and society has never been a facilitating environment for good relationships between African-American women and men. Today our young people are constantly bombarded with misogamist (hatred of marriage) and misogyny (hatred of women) messages through videos, music and television. The society has never embraced us as equals in the workplace either as we witness the attack upon affirmative action. It is very hard to be sane in an insane world. Dr. Singleton shows in her book, Broken Silence, that no matter how dire your personal, family, or work situation, through therapy and love, you can become a strong and vibrant woman. The process works for the &quot;brothers&quot; too. We all need help from time to time and should not be ashamed to seek it. This book should be placed upon everyone's &quot;must read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Broken Silence: Opening Your Heart and Mind to Therapy--A Black Woman's Recovery Guide","review":"Dr. D. Kim Singleton, noted psychologist, has braved a wilderness whose path is rarely travelled. Broken Silence helps black women give voice to their pain and rejection in a society that has been less than encouraging to them.The compassionate and graceful manner in which Dr. Singleton approaches, addresses and eventually aids her patients will help many women reading this book readily embrace therapy as a viable option in the fight against negative experiences from the past. It is a must-read for anyone crushed by the double whammy of racism and sexism in our society.Because Dr. Singleton is an African American woman, I must admit that I was ready to trust her as soon as I opened the book. After reading Broken Silence, I can truly say that I experienced a certain level of healing, personally. The book helped me understand how a professional can help me identify a problem; determine goals that will change the problem; put into practice measures that will bring about my goals and maintain the right attitude and therapist to insure continued success on my life's journey.I would recommend Broken Silence to everyone, but especially to African American women. By mastering a tool that has been traditionally mistrusted in our community, Dr. Singleton has used psychotherapy to pierce the silence of the eight black women in her book, and in so doing has offered hope and wholeness to all women everywhere."},{"Title":"Last Stand at Stalingrad: The Battle That Saved the World","review":"While there is no question that the battle for Stalingrad between German and Soviet forces was pivotal, it was not a battle that saved the world. It is true that some of the best German troops were killed or captured there, but the outcome of the war in Europe was largely determined by the Soviet Union not collapsing in 1941. If any battle can be said to be one that saved the world it was the battle in the skies over Britain in 1940. Had the British lost that battle and been invaded, it would have been nearly impossible for the United States and the remainder of the British Empire to ever launch a successful invasion of Europe.Nevertheless, the action at Stalingrad was extremely significant, for it was the last successful offensive action that the Germans carried out in the east. A moral, political and military victory for the Soviets, from that point on the best possible outcome for the Axis side was a stalemate in the east.Using a large number of pictures, this book is a solid description of the battle and how it unfolded over months. Major mistakes were made on the German side, nearly all by Hitler and some by Goring. The Soviet leaders gave ground when they had to, yet set a classic enclosure trap, attacking on the flanks that were held by the much weaker Rumanian, Italian and Hungarian forces. Overall, this is a good description of the major European battle of 1942."},{"Title":"A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist","review":"This isn't the saddest life story I've read, but it is sadness at a most unusual point in the scale of melancholy. Riddled with irony, too. Almost 50 years to the day after Andre Breton commented that Sage's work 'must have been done by a man' Sage was not even listed by name in the surrealist art catalogs and none of her work was to be found in galleries or museums. Only a couple of solo shows and one painting at the 1958 World's Fair. Being the wife of a major surrealist such as Yves Tanguy did not bolster Kay Sage's career in art to say the least. Sage was already well-schooled in art before she met Yves and she came from a wealthy family. The images of her art shown in this book is well worth the money for the picures alone. It will show you 'unofficial personal surrealism' that Women and American Artists from all walks of life have had to face and overcome. Sage's work stands on it's own, yet the enigmatic energy of her ill-fated life and career are revealed in &quot;A House Of Her Own&quot;.The book has several illustrations of paintings, drawings, and early photos including interior/exterior photos of the home Sage and Tanguy shared in Woodbury, Connecticut.For the Tanguy fans out there, this is a 'must read' book. Anyone that has sought out literature on the life of Yves Tanguy knows there isn't much to be found. A House Of Her Own reveals many details of a well-researched and authored biographer in Judith D. Suther."},{"Title":"A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist","review":"About 25 years ago I bought a used edition of a fairly comprehensive history of surrealism. While looking for references to Yves Tanguy, my favorite artist, I saw a small, black and white reproduction of one of Sage's paintings and became equally intriqued by her work. There has never been a biography of Tanguy in English, so I was amazed and delighted when Philip Horowitz told me about this book. Judith Suther's research and writing would do any art historian proud. She has reconstructed Sage's fascinating, tragic life with remarkable detail and immediacy. I have only two minor reservations with this book. Suther adopt's some feminist art hstorians' cant that Sage has been denied due recognition because of her gender. But Tanguy himself is only somewhat better known-note the absence of even one English-language biography. My other reservation is the paucity of color illustrations. I know this book is from a university press and the attendant economics, but for the rather high price, there should be more color illos here. Still, I'm grateful for the miraculous existence of this invaluable book."},{"Title":"A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist","review":"If you're not into art, namely the movement known as surrealism, I'm not sure if you'd like this book; perhaps you would. This biography is about the bizarre life of early 20th century American surrealist oil painter Kay Sage. In describing Sage's life, author Judith Suther delves into feminist issues, aspects of European and American artists during the WWII era, privilege, and a not too shabby psycho-analysis of Sage's work and surrealism overall: in fact you might like this book if you're not into surrealist art, but in that case it would be a very esoteric book I imagine.If, on the other hand, you're into art, and are not put off by surrealism, then you'll probably like this book a lot. I did. It's well represented by:A) Presenting a passable biography of artist Kay Sage.B) Presenting a passable psycho-analysis of Kay Sage's art.C) Exploring contemporary feminist issues in the context of an early 20th century woman artist, who achieved some acclaim in a predominately male dominated art world.D) Presenting fairly legible B&W; and color plates of Sage's interesting art.E) Presenting a passable history and definition of the surrealist school of art, and its transalantic American shift during WWII.These aspects, not necessarily in this order, made the book enjoyable. Admittedly, I paint, and I place substantial significance on the philosophy of art, especially on the sub-category surrealism. On the one extreme, if you are oriented toward these criteria, this book is highly recommended; on the other, it might be an interesting read about an obscure early 20th century senator's daughter turned princess turned surrealist artist. The fact that Sage drilled her heart out with a pearl handled .32 at the bitter end lends a Hemingway-esque twist to this pseudo-lonely artist's tale; she apparently was a brassy broad inside (revealed in her poetry, which is also showcased in the book), with the exterior of fine French antique: which Sage was not, she was a good to great American artist, an individualist, and a pioneer (of herself, as well as her genre of art). Some of her finest works look frankly into the abyss.In the final analysis, what kind of artist Sage was is ambiguous. She was a surrealist, yet she wasn't quite. She followed this school of art, yet created her own trademark icons. She really seemed to create a unique niche of her own within a genre. There's an enigma here that isn't easily defined. Were her works powerful, or subtle? That's up to the interpreter to decide."},{"Title":"A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist","review":"When I buy a book about an artist I expect to see pictures....with color.

Being a fixed income derivatives trading, I find both sections particularly useful for real world trading. The risk modeling section should expand into topics other than VAR such as coherent risk measures which are more useful. The co-integration section is a must for any traders who want to trade mean-reversion or stats arbitrage.Overall, I think that the book covers all basic to intermediate mathematics, econometrics and finance necessary for anyone who wants to model market data.

It manages to cover each topic in the original style of the author: motivating, practical and full of examples with comments on the pitfalls of implementation.The highpoints are (i) a comprehensive and illuminating review of GARCH models, (ii)new applications of PCA to the generation of robust, positive semi-definite covariance matrices (orthogonal GARCH) and to the analysis of volatility smiles and (iii) cointegration models with application to the design of hedge fund strategies. These are three areas where Carol Alexander not only shows her deep knowledge of previous research but has also made her own original contributions.This book should be a must for MSc students in finance and economics. It should also be a useful intoductory guide to seasoned practitioners who will benefit from its numerous and up to date references. The CD alone with its databases and numerous working examples is worth ten times the price of the book."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Alexander's new book is essential reading for intellectual risk managers, quant traders, and quantitatively minded market analysts; Ph.D students in finance would probably also find the book both useful and inspiring.The book has two outstanding qualities that set it apart from its benchmark, ie the 'average' of serious finance books.#1. The book is refreshingly well written. Considering that the topics of finance and risk management are not that conducive to stylistic efforts, this book is a marvel of clarity.#2. Market modeling is a topic that in most financial institutions on both the sell and the buy sides does not receive as much attention as it deserves and requires. Don't we all know of seemingly sophisticated risk management departments that actually are quite simplistic in how they generate volatility scenarios? Or what about the often mindless cranking out of historically based VaR estimates without considering the risk characteristics of the current regime? The beauty of this book is that it discusses market modeling in relation to its uses in other risk analytical areas such as derivatives modeling and VaR analysis."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"For a starter, this book does offer a broad spectrum of subjects, volatility/variance measurement, PCAs, Factor Models, Time Series analysis, high frequency data modeling, etc, at the expense of rigor and depth.Desipite the academic pedigree the author enjoys and the educational career she had, the book is rather poorly organized from a pedagogical point of view. She seems to have a tendency to refer to expressions, notions, ideas, data which appear much later than where the reference takes place. This makes first-timers cringe as they go through the chapters as they are laid out. It reads much like some published papers got dumbed down, and bundled together.If you are looking for comprehensive introduction, without the gory details of mathematical mumblejumble, this book might be of help. But it may not be used as a reference book, for its organization and for its lack of rigor."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Without repeating the previous ratings, I can say that Carol Alexander's work already contributed considerably to my work after just one hour. The combination of clearly expressed ideas and excellent spreadsheets/VBA code helps the reader not only to understand but also to implement rather complex concepts in a short amount of time.It is similar to other practical books like Financial Modeling, but deals with far more complex models. Hopefully, more authors will adopt this kind of practical presentation without being trivial."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Market Models is an essential tool for practioners who would like to gain fundamental expertise on financial modeling. Aside from the practical view, Alexander's book has got such a clear and comprehensive reading that even the most inexpert individuals can get enthusiastically involved in learning issues related to risk management, investment analysis and financial forecasting. Recent econometric techniques on time series are brilliantly applied with real examples on the finance field. The book demonstrates that the author has a great knowledge on both a theoretical as well as a practical basis on market modeling and knows how to combine the two aspects in a very intelligent way. I considered this book to be a fundamental reference for either financial profesionals and academics."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Pricing/hedging and risk modelers in banks and in universities are going to find this book really useful. Quite a heavy weight text but written carefully and clearly - plenty of examples and a very professional CD loaded with useful data and programs."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Carol Alexander's book does an excellent job of combining many of the disparate modelling techniques currently used in the financial markets while also providing many helpful real world examples. It thus successfully combines theory and application. The book is accessible to different types of users as it includes both in-depth qualitative analysis as well as quantitative ones.I have found it very useful in my work when trying to understand different concepts in the financial market models. Personally, I believe the book is a helpful tool one does not want to pass up--not only for the ones involved in risk measurement, but also for those in the more general field of investment banking as myself."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"This book provides a fine selection of econometric methods on financial market modelling such as GARCH, principal components analysis and time series. I find the book useful for practitioners involved in quantitative modelling as the approach balances between presenting the theoretical basis and discussing practical implementation issues. The author has done a pretty good job in explaining statistical concepts such as maximum likelihood, GARCH in an accessible manner without dwelling too much on the technical mathematics commonly found in statistical or econometric books. The necessary statistical backgound is included, making it self-contained. The accompanying CD-ROM contains sufficient source code to enable the reader to move from conceptual understanding to implementation. In short, it is a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"I will consider this book as a good introduction to different ways to analyze market data (covering mainly equity but do touch on fixed income as well as currency). I would emphasize that the book model the market more from an empirical point of view. The author gives a good description of the GARCH model as well as PCA analysis. Being a fixed income derivatives trading, I find both sections particularly useful for real world trading. The risk modeling section should expand into topics other than VAR such as coherent risk measures which are more useful. The co-integration section is a must for any traders who want to trade mean-reversion or stats arbitrage.Overall, I think that the book covers all basic to intermediate mathematics, econometrics and finance necessary for anyone who wants to model market data. The book explains how to use such model for trading, risk management as well as market data visualization / understanding."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"This is an excellent book which covers a very wide range of tools and techniques. It's emphasizes not just the theory, but practical implementations of that theory through worked examples on the accompanying CD -- which vitally includes real-life data. An invaluable book for everyone in this field."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Without repeating the previous ratings, I can say that Carol Alexander's work already contributed considerably to my work after just one hour.

Professor Alexander is considered as the leader by many in this field. Her many years of experience on both sides of the Atlantic (over 10 years) in consulting on risk management and investment analysis with positions in highly respected banking firms has put together this little gem of a book (long awaited). Professor Alexander's emphasis is based on understanding concepts and implementing solutions. Her past books have been best sellers and are extensively used both in academia and by financial institutions. This book is the only one of its kind that deals with key techniques for selecting and developing models, while using the latest insights into the pricing and hedging of options. At the same time the book focuses on a linear algebraic approach as an important tool for the anlaysis of financial systems. The book nicely deals with traditional time series analysis and is explained using 1)cointegration to long short equity hedge funds and 2) high frequency data prediction using neural networks. This book is a must read for academics, risk management specialists, money managers, analysts and others looking for a clear presentation of the subject. Congratulations on a great text. Hope a second volume is on the way."},{"Title":"Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis","review":"Carol Alexander is a highly respected risk manager.

The romance between Lucian and Jaxx is passionate and intense, and it's wonderful watching them find happiness and eternal love in each other's arms. Amidst the affecting romance of Jaxx and Lucian, Feehan seamlessly mixes in a tale of danger and excitement that will keep readers turning pages. \\"Dark Guardian\\" was a truly enjoyable read and it comes highly recommended....Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"This was the first book I read in the Dark series and it's still my favourite. I love the way Christine writes and the characters and plots are very original and engaging. I highly recommend all of Christine's books!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"The all dark series by the Christine Feehan is introducing the amazing world of the Carpathian people. One of the best book is the Dark Guardian which is full with struggle with vampires but also with tender emotions and love."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"He is Lucian, both he and his twin Gabriel, were legendary warriors, who had been fighting the vampire before Mikhail Dubrinsky became prince of the Carpathian people. Now that his twin has found his lifemate Francesca, Lucian now looks for his own. He has been warned that she is young and has been subjected to much emotional pain, and he must find her, or she will suffer even more in the future.She is Jaxom Montgomery, a young, petite police officer, who takes her duty to protect very seriously. Set up on a raid, she is seriously injured, and finds herself in Lucian's care. Jaxom has deep feelings for him, and she is terrified because every person she has ever cared about has been murdered. A psychopathic killer, from her past, is growing ever closer.With both the vampire and the killer stalking them, their love will be tested. Can Lucian truly protect them both as he promised?This book is one of my favs in the Dark series. I do have a few. Ms. Feehan's earlier Dark novels were her best in my opinion, and this one deserves very high marks. I do hope you try this one.P.S. Gabriel's story is 'Dark Legend'. I highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"so i really am a die hard dark series fan but, yes there is a but. i have read some books out of order. do here goes my review . i feel that this book was wonderful just like i am preety much used to with this story line. I kind of wish that there was a bit more stuory in this book but it was a still a good read. i was having some issues with the stories after dark possesion i believe it was because all of a sudden the stories were not sexy they were actually quite vulgar and I really do not feel her stories need to be so vulgar. It is not necessary to bescribe every single thing that happens when they have sex in the stories. to me it kind of takes away from the story. I was like wow. this story was like what i am used to great story , but needed a little bit more story and great sexual incounters. so far someof the stories i have read that came out later was porn but i really still like her stories they are amazing."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"3.5/5.0Gotta love those Carpathian boys! While Lucian did not prove to be a favorite - his arrogance and disregard for Jaxon's wishes became overly obnoxious even for this bunch - the premise of the all-powerful man who moves heaven and earth to secure and be with his love is irresistible every single time!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have read almost all of Christine's books, I really like her books. This is one of the few I have not reread, it is not my least favorite but close. My least favorite was Water Bound, actually I didn't like it at all. Lucian's story was one I anticipated, the previous books painted a very alluring character. Lucian being such a legend, and brother to Gregori, I expected him to be more heroic and powerful. I guess I can't say I disliked it, I was just disappointed because the character didn't live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"As always Feehan leaves you wanting more! Her twisting plots and romantic interludes go hand in hand making you want to read till the end in sitting.The Carpathian dark series is fabulous reading whether for the vampire or the romance. Can't wait to read more in this series."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Loved the story line and the action of this story. While the men are still in the dark ages, the women are sassy and spunky - yea for them.BY THE WAY, HOW DO WE GET DARK PRINCE ON THE USA KINDLE?"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I readily admit I'm new to Feehan's work. The first book (and mainly because I own a Kindle and not all her work is Kindle available) I've read of the Dark Series was Dark Fire. I enjoyed it immensely as it had some verbal bantering, hot & steamy scenes and the typical Alpha Male. Although Dark Guardian had an alpha in Lucian it just didn't hold my attention that Dark Fire did. Actually, I couldn't wait to end this book. I felt the characters were likable (both were appealingly lonely, both strong & confident who sacrificed their personal lives to keep loved-ones safe from harm) but the plot just dragged and dragged. Lucian didn't really have to \\"win\\" her. Jaxon accepted the lifestyle way too easily and her random misgivings were more annoyingly fake than genuine. I gave this book three stars because I liked the characters, liked the idea of these two characters finding one another but the story just didn't have the \\"punch\\" that I was looking for."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Like everyone else, I patiently wait for this book to come out. I was very disapointed with the story. Gabriel's story really captured your attention and I thought that Lucian's would be just as good. I found Jaxon &quot;whiny&quot; and hyprocritical. The whole build up with her step-father was very good, but the final confrontation (if you could call it that) was terrible. I hope further books in the series are more well thought out."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I am a big fan of Christine Feehan, and I love her &quot;Dark&quot; series. Overall, I really enjoyed her newest installment in Dark Guardian. But there were a few quibbles that I had with the book that prevented me from giving it a higher rating. Mostly they centered around Jaxx, the heroine. When we first meet her and read about her life in the first chapter, I was looking for a completely different human heroine than what we have seen in the other Dark books. Since she was a policewoman, trained by the Navy Seals as a child, I thought she would be more centered and mature as a character. While there were some instances she displayed this throughout the book, overall I felt she was not as &quot;fleshed&quot; out as she could have been, especially considering her profession. At times I felt she was not deserving for the hero.However, Lucian was great. Perhaps it is because he is a true ancient, but he was very mellow and understanding, and allowed Jaxx more freedom than some other Carpathians we have read about. And I really was moved by the part were he tells Jaxx about the &quot;man&quot; who told him about Gabriel's lifemate. The end was also moving, in which we see a reunion of sorts with most of the Carpathians. As said before, overall I enjoyed this book, although not as much as Dark Legend, which was the story of Gabriel, Lucian's twin brother.But it kept me entertained and I look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Lucian, the legendary twin Carpathian warrior over 2,000 yrs. old who has sacrificed over time for his people and his brother...selfless, intelligent, creative, warrior, unsurpassed by any other...How could he possibly find his match in a young teenage girl type pixie cop from america who scales walls to \\"protect\\" Lucian and kicks him in the knee like a child to get his attention? really? after the masterpiece story and novel his brother Gabriel (book 7) was given I expected Lucian's to be a masterpiece as well. I have read ALL the Carpathian novels and this was the most dissapointing and not deserving of Lucian's legendary status. Skip it and make up your own story/fantasy about Lucian anything would be better than this one."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Jaxx is the strongest female character that Ms. Feehan has created. Instead of the other character who simper about being independent Jaxx is... she doesn't whine about things that are inconsequential.Lucien is the most unforgettable of the Carpathian males to date. He does not apologize repeatedly for who he is like Gregori. He does not condescend to her. He teaches her how to be a carpathian by letting her do and be.This book is quite different than the rest. Enjoy it. Also if you liked this you might like. Passion by Donna Boyd and the Anita Blake Series by Laurell HamiltonIf you are looking for the same story line with different character names, look for books by Johanna Lindsey."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I anxiously awaited Christine Feehan's latest Carpathian novel, Dark Guardian. I devoured the book in one night - reading until the wee hours of the morning. But I have to say that while I enjoyed Lucian and Jaxx' story, it wasn't my favorite. I found Jaxx's character to be a bit powerless. Someone who had survived the horrors of what she lived through, I thought, would be incredibly strong willed. Instead it seemed to me that she spent a lot of time stomping her foot, rather than taking action.Lucian on the other hand...wow! His character is incredibly kind and generous with Jaxx. He allows Jaxon to do things that no other Carpathian male would allow.Feehan does a great job of building the tension between the two characters, culminating in her trademark *steamy* scenes. I really enjoyed the book, I just wasn't completely sure that I felt that Jaxx deserved Lucian.That being said, I'm already ready for Christine Feehan's next \\"Dark\\" book and realize that I have at least 8 months to wait."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I just finished Dark Guardian and once again I am emotionally moved by Lucian's & Gabriel's love for each other. It is especially meaningful in these modern times where a lot of siblings are often at each other's throats and forget the true meaning of family and loyalty.My religion is Buddhism, yet I felt it was very clever how Christine Feehan had written the passage about Lucian meeting a man \\"who some say is the son of God\\" so that it is left to interpretation. What a true artist she is!Gabriel loved his brother so much and it was breaking his heart to face the fact that he must destroy Lucien when he thought he had turned into a vampire. Because through it all, he also knows how much Lucien has loved and sacrificed for him. And he was right, Lucian was granted one wish in his life, and he unselfishly used it to bring a Lifemate for Gabriel.Christine F. has a true gift, her novels are not only getting better & better, but they also spiritually move you as well. She gives us hope that Good will always triumph over Evil and sooner or later if we haven't already, we all will meet our own lifemates."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"These books are good, just extremely repititous. they basically give the backstory over and over in each book."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Wow! Not be as serious as some of the reviews, I found the storyline fun and exciting. I definitely prefer Lucian over his twin, Gabriel. Lucian is so hot that he does kind of make Gabriel look like a married old man. LOL. Yes, the storyline is a bit crazy, but many of them are. I just really enjoyed the chemistry between Jaxon and Lucian and thought that it was well done."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have enjoyed reading this series even though I didn't start with the first one. It is unique to find a series that builds on itself enough to to maintain it's status as a series but also leave enough individuality that they can be read out of sequence. The back story to vampires and how they came to be is also much more believable than anything else that I've read/seen."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I could not put this book down! I loved it. I'm a new fan. I've read this book twice now. The only disapointment was the final battle between Jaxon's father and Lucian. I expected more. But over all, WOW!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"When I first started to read this book, I was confused. I didn't any on the Dark series before this. At first, I thought the worst of Lucian but then it slowly made sense. I think Christine Feehan did any exelent job of discribing a world that is imaginary and discribing the origin of vampires.As I read the book, I was caught up in a world that vampires and ghouls do run around and we need a race like the Carpathians to keep us safe. I think the scenes are described very well and if someone is looking to read a book about the paranormal with romance, the Dark series is an excelent series to read. I can't wait to read the other books!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"All I can say is I hope Ms. Freehan keeps writing I am waiting for the next installment to this series. If you have not read them try it! I did and now I am hook. Even if you have not tried vampire romances try this series you will not regret it! In this book two strong characters come together. Lucian who has been hunting for his people for centuries and of course Jaxxon who is use to being on her own and getting her way. (not taking orders from anyone) It was great to see the chemistry between the two. Although you do have to feel for Lucian as he struggles on how to deal w/ Jaxxon. It was a great story my only complaint would be that it ended to soon. This book will leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Christine Feehan is one of the better authors that I have read. I have the complete DARK series and they all have a flare to them. There is always suspense as well as the expected romance. Experience the feel of two people in love, while One is Dark the other is mortal. Immerse yourself into a book that will keep you on your toes. I couldn't put it down. Enjoy a great romance."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"From the back of the book...He was the dark guardian of his people. So how, after centuries of a bleak, soulless existence, had he, Lucian Daratrazanoff, suddenly come to crave petite, curvy, colorful lady cop Jaxon Montgomery, who foolishly made it her life's work to protaect others from harm?Fiercely daring, Jaxx would sacrifice anything to shield others-particularly since a deadly menace dogged her every footstep, threating all who got close to her. And strangely seductive, piercingly erotic Lucian was no execption. Lucien was powerfully, perilously mesmerizing-oddly gentle yet clearly a born preadtor. He had vowed to posses her, to guard her for all time. Yet with his every thirsty kiss, was he drawing Jaxon more deeply into danger... and his dark, mysterious desires?"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Christine Feehan. Although I had read After Twilight, I didn't like her books until now. Mrs. Feehan is a great writer, and thanks to her, I veiw people in a very different way."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because it is Christine Feehan and she has a wonderful imagination and great sensual scenes... BUT... I felt that the writer, either ran out of words or just had to fill up the pages to meet the requirements for a longer romance than was necessary... It seemed to me that every love scene was filled with tired clich&eacute;s, like &quot;...He took her breath away...&quot; or &quot;... She took his breath away..&quot; to the point that I felt like the characters were on the verge of chocking and collapsing from lack of oxygen... If you've never read any of Christine Feehan's romances, you will probably enjoy it, but I would suggest her first few Dark series romances (Dark Prince; Dark Desire; Dark Magic) or The Scarletti Curse... Still, all Christine Feehan's books have wonderful characters and unusual settings. Hope next books will be more imaginative and less repetious..."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I'm writing this so late in the game because I wanted to see how long it would take for this author to realize the magic is gone out of this series. I had great hopes fot this book, as I have enjoyed all the previous \\"Dark\\" books. However, it's trite, boring, predictable and has a heroine you want to beat (...)and then the hero too."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I'm a fan of Christine Feehan's Dark series and have read them all so I was eager to devour Dark Guardian. Unfortunately, Lucian and Jaxon's story is a major disappointment, especially when compared to its great predecessor, Dark Legend. In Legend, Lucian is a complex, even menacing character. In Guardian, he definitely pales but I must give him major brownie points for putting up with Jaxon's whining. The chemistry between Jaxon and Lucian is tepid, the plot is thin and the redundant dialogue quickly grows tiresome. Even the villain is weak. His maniacal behavior isn't adequately explained. This was a great opportunity to have an evil, frightening character which never materialized, and the final confrontation was a major letdown.Feehan usually hits the mark. Dark Guardian definitely needs a transfusion."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have read and keep all of the Dark Series. Although Jaxon was raised to be the ultimate weapon, needing only herself for company; she fails as the story unfolds. She is bound to Lucian before she even knows what that means...but, when she does find out she takes the attitude as long as she doesn't think about it, it didn't happen. The whole build-up in the prologue makes you believe this woman will finally see what it means to be a Lifemate. This heroin is definitely different but entirely disappointing as Lucian's Lifemate. He deserved so much more!So once again we have the heroin trying to protect her \\"Carpathian Lifemate\\" who in all his centuries of living only comes close to death trying to save her from her bumbling interference and distracting inabilities. This time by not handling her nemisis who she has been aware of since age 13. I wonder at the constant necessity of repeating her superior abilities throughout much of the book.Well, I think I shall return to reading Amanda Ashley, Linda Lael Miller, and, of course, the wonderful Maggie Shayne. These authors do not disappoint.Whatever you do, do not write to the author and give any criticism as her only suggestion is for you not to read her. It is such a shame as the idea of a Carpathian versus a true vampire had such potential and the Carpathians in her books are really quite good...it is the heroins which disappoint."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Like many readers, I was sorely disappointed with the heroine. Jaxon Montgomery started this journey as a warrior. She finished as a whimpering, fainting damsel in distress.Her character is established early on as a firery, seasoned soldier turned supercop. Why then, was she so willing to surrender her fate to a man who thought little of her 20 years of training (she was a military brat trained from early childhood by her father and stepfather)? Where was her rage when the pain started and she woke up no longer human, but a full-blooded Carpathian who has to drink blood to survive? Lucian never even asked what she thought about conversion. She should have made good on her threat and shot him--just once. It would have been more believable than what we were given.To make things worse, when the moment of truth comes and she has to face off with her nemesis...she faints. Lucian delivered the smack down Jaxon had been holding in all her life. &quot;Oh, save me mighty man; I'm just a girl trained to kill by the US government. I can't possibly defend myself with the many guns and knives I own. They're mostly for decoration.&quot;Add the fact that the formula has grown stale and boring, and I don't see any reason to read on. Just one time, I would love to see the heroine rebel openly and agressively against this situation. I want her to refuse becoming a lifemate and stand her ground. Why shouldn't he have to work for it?The steamy love scenes just weren't enough to hold my interest this time around."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I love all the Christine Feehan books and this is no different.

These two didn't seem as perfect a fit as Gabriel and Francesca. I loved that the other couples are mentioned more often in this installment of the series. I enjoyed Jaxon's past as a paramilitary trainee and saucy policewoman, but she just flopped as a heroine. She was just a whimp and I expected more strength and maturity from that type of character. And give me a break, a sniper from one mile away straight through a spinal cord? ha ha. And very unlikely that the oldest ancient and most cunning hunter didn't have a clue? I felt that Gabriel needed Francesca more, Francesca was so strong and confident. I hoped for some of that in Jaxon but got none of it.I really enjoyed the ending, great ending.

I have thoroughly enjoyed these 'Dark' series of books. Those Carpathians are the ultimate warriors and lovers. This tale of Lucian is, in my estimation, one of the best of the 'Dark' series. Jaxon, or Jaxx, as she is called, is one of the most complicated of the heroines in these books. She is strong, compassionate and feels she must protect everyone in her small world. I discovered the answer to one of my questions in the book 'Dark Legend', the story of Gabriel. Lucian told Gabriel that someone he trusted not to tell an untruth had said that Gabriel had a Lifemate somewhere in the future. That person is revealed in this book. You have to be quick to catch it, don't try to skim through the pages. Jaxon needs someone strong to protect her from all the horror that is going on around her. I did feel that Ms. Feehan had a bit too much horror and death going on in this story, and even Jaxon, strong as she is, would have gone over the edge, Lucian or no Lucian. We all have known that Lucian was one of the strongest of the Carpathian males, and it is only right that his Lifemate is one of the strongest of the human psychic females. My only concern is, whose story will be next? And when will it be out so I can read it!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"&quot;Dark Guardian&quot; is the story of twin Julian and his desire to find his lifemate before he succumbs to the dark in his soul that he has been keeping at bay for his brother's sake.Still filled with steamy scenes; this book left me unfulfilled. The ending was anti-climatic. What is supposed to be a major setup for justice was fizzled out. The issue could have been addressed much earlier; instead of stringing along the reader. As the reader I anticipated much more to the face-off between Julian and Jaxx's stepfather and was bitterly disappointed.My biggest irk was the domineering ways of Julian in &quot;converting&quot; Jaxx. For an incredibly independent and strong (both physically and mentally) woman, she capitulated rather easily. No major histronics or displays of anger. The character of Jaxx could have been done so much better. Instead it left me wanting more.It must be tough for an author to continue to make the storylines fresh and interesting for the reader. How many ways can a Carpathian meet his lifemate and bond her? With this book it seems she has run out of the ways. Since I have gone this far in the series I have purchased the next one and hope it redeems it self. On the bright side it can't be much worse than this one."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I would have to say that Dark Gaurdian is definately my favorite so far in the carpathian series. I loved the characters Lucian and Jaxon. I have not been disappointed yet by Mrs. Freehan. I enjoyed all of the books so far in the series and rate them all as 5 star reads."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Dark Guardian is a great entry in Feehan's unique, sensual and highly compelling Dark series.Jaxon (Jaxx) Montgomery, a tough young police officer, has already endured a life of misery in which she's lost everyone she's ever cared about to her murderous stepfather, Tyler Drake, an ex-Navy Seal who's still at large.Lucian Daratrazanoff has been a powerful guardian of his people, the Carpathians, for thousands of years. He uses his enormous supernatural mental and physical powers to hunt and destroy vampires and to protect the weak. However, his emotions have withered so he lives a bleak, soulless life-until he meets Jaxx.Lucian is convinced that Jaxx is his lifemate. After he saves her from an ambush, her real adventure begins. She discovers a secret, shadow world of unimaginable power and danger as she fights by Lucian's side. In the meantime, she begins to discover the inner secrets of the enigmatic and fascinating Lucian-a male of intense power, confidence and utter devotion to her. Under Jaxx's influence, Lucian is able to recover his emotions-and they are as intense as any romantic hero in all of literature.This is one of the best romances I've ever read. The tender and highly erotic relationship between Lucian and Jaxx is developed in such detail and with such an excitement of discovery that the book is impossible to put down. It is a steamy, wild adventure ride that will utterly entertain any romance reader. Author Christine Feehan is truly a master of exciting erotic prose and deep character emotion. I can hardly wait to read all of her other books!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Personally this was the first Dark book that i read, and i loved it. But the repetition of plot in most of the books, and of the word 'creamy' is really sickening after a while; i loved the charachters in this book, and in Dark Legend and Dark Gold especially - have the charachters now dropped off the face of the earth?speaking on behalf of myself and anyone else who wants to be included, i beg the author to please return to some of our old charachters and continue their stories. life doesn't end after 'the guy gets the girl' - we've heard of Gabriel &amp; Francesca's struggle to keep Tamara alive - that, plus fighting some vampires who want to get Tamara/Skyler could be the basis of a new book, which would also solve the 'same-plot' problem others are complaining about.on the whole, this book was totally awesome - the best yet, i think. but it's time for a bit of a change in the whole overlying plot of the series, and the existing plot is so intriguing that alot can be done with it outside the realm of romance."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Christine Feehan has done it again!

Her vampire concept and sex/love scenes sizzled, and I do think Christine Freehan is one of the best writers for this. But, after a few novels, as others have said, the whole repetition of basic characters, themes, words, antagonists gets tiring. Feehan puts teasers in each novel for expansion of concepts in this series, such as development of the ongoing interrelationships between all the Carpathians and their lifemates, but she never flushes it out, other than between Darius and Julian. Readers become attached to all these hero/heroine characters and want more interaction from them than just seduction, sex and vampire combat. This particular novel started out great because I liked Jaxon's fight for others and her interactions with Lucien. I thought they were the most descriptive of a true relationship between partners. But the end fell flat and ridiculous except for the wedding, which all readers would have liked to attend(Hint Hint Feehan). And I must say that as a writer, I couldn't believe that she had Lucien describe to Jaxon, the incident which gave him hope to live for the next 2000 without a lifemate. The incident where he sacrificed his needs for his brother's. In these powerful passages, Lucien describes meeting the Son of God, which is Jesus, who gives him hope for his brother and him to continue their fight by Jesus's radiating compassion, light, goodness, etc. Jesus gives Lucien a wish, and Lucien asks for a lifemate for his brother Gabriel. Now hearing this moving event of Lucien's sacrificial love for his brother, Jaxon, who wants a church wedding, so we know that she obviously has at least some Christian upbringing, merely states \\"And you believed him?\\" He responds that he does and the subject is dropped. Come on!!! Anyone, Christian or not, would want to know about this historical figure, something other than \\"and you believed him?\\" And what does this statement of hers mean anyway? Is she asking did Lucien convert to Christinity? Does she doubt Jesus's abilities herself, although for some reason, she wants a church wedding. Lucien must obviously have believed Jesus since his wish for Gabriel had already came true, and Lucien is alive with a lifemate of his own after 2000 years of sacrifice for others. It was ridiculous dialogue for Jaxon!!! How interesting it would have been had she explored a Carpathian's idea of God and how he relates to God. This is typical of my frustration of Feehan throughout this series. She'll put out an interesting concept(such as Shea's search for the cause of the Carpathian's infertility, female babies) and only superficially develops it, if she even develops it at all. In an interview, she stated she cannot write about family reunions as it takes up to much of the book and she is limited to a word count. She is so repetitive in all these subsequent books, sometimes paragraph per paragraph, that of course she has room for new words. She just won't do it. She states this is a romance series nothing else. Whether she accepts it or not, this creation of hers has taken on a life of its own, and it's as if she is scared to delve into something other than her formula. She could be a great writer, but will never be as long as she has this attitude. And now I realize that reading the first two or three books over and over is just as good as buying the series."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I think all of Ms. Feehan's books are a cut above others & in particular, her dark series. I personally found Dark Legend to be the best of the dark series ever (although previously Prince, Desire & Magic were neck in neck for that distinction). Dark Guardian rated 4 stars because it was a little different start this time - interesting, as the prologue really grabbed you. If you've read Legend than you know who Lucien is - the guardian of his people, alone for centuries until he meets Jaxon - she is the light to his darkness. While there's is a loving & extremely torrid relationship (as they all are), for some reason it just didn't have the strength of Gabriel & Francesca's & as I read Legend just a couple of months earlier, I couldn't help but compare the two. Again, this book is very good and the storyline of Jaxon's stepfather was eerie & truly gripping at times and I do recommend it; I just didn't think the relationship was as intense as some of the others."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Yes, yes, yes, we get it. Lucian is dark and brooding and handsome and powerful and dangerous and yada, yada, yada. We only have to be told about 15 times before we grasp it, 150 times is just overkill, not to mention ANNOYING The book would have been about 100 pages shorter and a lot less clunky without the unnecessary repition of details. Somebody get this girl a better editor."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I like Ms. Christine's work, specialy her \\" Dark..\\" ones. This one is one of my favorte. Lucian is a lovely charactor. He is handsome, powerful, more powerful than some Carpathian men I had read yet he love and treat his lifemate so loving and gentle. Jaxx is a nice character too. As a police officer, her job is to protect people. However, her life had never been at peace since a mad man, her step-father, doged after her and killed people she loved: her mother, her brother, her co-worker.... She'd never allowed hershelf to love or be in love with anybody because she didn't want that person to die. When she met Lucian, a stranger who saved her and her co-worker from a set-up, she always tried to protect him, warned him of the danger he is in. His heart melted for she tried to protect him, yet never he worried about the mad man because he has come to protect her, his lifemate. He is her dark guardian, also a famous vambier hunter of his people...What will happen? Read the book and find out by yourself. This one have a happy ending, as most of Ms. Christine's books. The only thing that I don't like about it is it seems like Lucien didn't have to court or woo Jaxx. He just simply bind her with him by the ritual. Anyway, that's nice too."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I am not one to collect or re-read books... but the Dark Series is worthy of keeping and re-reading.

Cheers to Christine Feehan, a gifted writer with unique story lines that keep your turning the pages. Please keep them coming... can barely wait for the next Carpathian book. X:-)"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"&quot;Dark Guardian&quot; by Christine Feehan is the 8th instalment in the wonderfully sensual and intriguing &quot;Dark&quot; series, and once again Feehan does not disappoint. With fresh and likeable characters and a storyline filled with passion, danger, and suspense, &quot;Dark Guardian&quot; will leave readers cheering Feehan's remarkable talent.Lucian, one of the legendary ancient Carpathian twins, has spent the last several hundred years pretending to have turned vampire in order to keep his beloved twin (Gabriel of &quot;Dark Legend&quot;) from turning vampire himself, knowing that Gabriel had a lifemate out there somewhere. And now that Gabriel has found his other half, Lucian feels his mission has come to an end. For the years he has spent hunting and killing the undead have left a stain of darkness on Lucian's soul, and he has grown weary of his endless colourless and emotionless existence. But Gabriel's lifemate, Francesca, insists that she knows of Lucian's lifemate, and that this woman desperately needs Lucian's help.And indeed Lucian does find his lifemate, feisty lady cop Jaxon Montgomery, who has dedicated her life to protecting others. But Jaxon has had a nightmarish start in life, with a crazed stepfather who murders everyone who gets close to her, including her biological parents and little brother, and her beloved foster parents. As a result, Jaxx lives a solitary and lonely life, never getting too close to anyone for fear that it will get them killed. So when Lucian appears out of the night to save her from a bust gone wrong, she immediately fears that Lucian will become the next target of her stepfather Tyler Drake's bloodlust.Recuperating in Lucian's huge and lovely home, Jaxx becomes aware that Lucian is no ordinary man. But though she witnesses some of his remarkable powers, she still fears for his safety. Lucian, on the other hand, is not at all concerned about one mortal man, ex-Navy SEAL though he might be, but he is incredibly touched by Jaxx's concern for him. Jaxon fears the deep connection she feels between herself and Lucian, and doesn't know how to live as one half of a couple after a lifetime of being utterly alone. But Lucian is remarkably gentle and understanding with Jaxon, giving her time to adjust to all the changes in her life. Because Lucian knows the one thing he will never do is let Jaxon go, for she is the light to his darkness, the very air he breathes and the other half of his soul.But Jaxx is like a beacon of light drawing the soulless undead to her, as they all know that a human woman with psychic powers can be converted into one of them. Indeed, Lucian makes the decision that the only way to keep Jaxx safe is to convert her into a Carpathian, and it was a refreshing change to have a heroine who simply dealt with the change and moved on, rather than agonizing over it. Together, Lucian and Jaxx formulate a plan to draw out the undead hunting Jaxx and Tyler Drake. And there is no chance that Jaxx will sit back while Lucian fights her battles, so she and Lucian become true partners, another refreshing change from previous books. This book builds the suspense effectively to a thrilling climax, and will leave readers utterly sated and satisfied.&quot;Dark Guardian&quot; is another fantastic entry is Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series and it is not to be missed. The romance between Lucian and Jaxx is passionate and intense, and it's wonderful watching them find happiness and eternal love in each other's arms. Amidst the affecting romance of Jaxx and Lucian, Feehan seamlessly mixes in a tale of danger and excitement that will keep readers turning pages. &quot;Dark Guardian&quot; was a truly enjoyable read and it comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Ok I have loved every book in the Dark series but I really think that this one may have been the best. I couldn't put it down. I usually like to spread these books out so that I don't have to wait and wait for the next but after I read Dark Legend which is Gabriel's story and found out that this was Lucian's story I had to read it as soon as I got it.Lucian is the twin to Gabriel and is one of the very ancient ones. He has lived for over 2000 years as the greatest hunter of the Carpathians. He has a voice that can make even the most evil of vampires do whatever he wants. He soon finds though that his voice, although compelling, cannot easily command his lifemate. After centuries he finds her. She is human but has special abilities that allow her to be his true lifemate. Jaxx has had a horrid childhood and is a loner because of it. She is haunted by a evil past that has stalked her and everyone deer to her for years. Lucian has vowed to protect her but she is a cop and can protect herself. She fears that she will put Lucian in danger so she fights what her heart and soul are telling her. She decides that she will protect Lucian and fight alongside him in his battles. This is the first time the heroine has taken such a strong role in protecting her lifemate. I really enjoyed how she could be both strong yet vulnerable at the same time.The love scenes are hot and so wonderfully written. The whole book is just so good that I was both happy and sad at the end because I knew I'd have to wait awhile for a new book. I would recommend these books to anyone, not just because they are romances but because the stories are so well written that you feel like the characters are actually real."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Dark Guardian is Lucian's story. He is one of the legendary twins who was brought forth to our attention in Dark Legend as he played a cat &amp; mouse game with his twin (Gabriel), hoping to prevent him for turning to the dark side. You see, long ago, a &quot;man&quot; unlike he had ever encountered, a man of peace and gentleness, told Lucian that there was a lifemate for his twin. Cleverly, unselfishly, he sets upon a path that insures that his beloved twin will never turn vampire.Ms. Feehan's adaption of Lucian was breathtaking. He was extremely brilliant, powerful and very, very menacing. Clearly, he was the strongest and most powerful of the Carpathians. He had defended his people for endless centuries and his struggle with the dark side was evident from the start of DL. This Carpathian was definitely an alpha male and one that I eagerly awaited to read about.Onto the story: Jaxxon Montgomery's young life has been spent in fear and in horror. Her stepfather, Tyler Drake, a former SEAL, has killed anyone that has gotten close to her including her own parents &amp; foster parents. He is clever, cunning and clearly deranged shaping Jaxx into a heroine who is determined to protect herself. She becomes a cop forever knowing that her stepfather is out there waiting to strike again.When her life is in peril, Lucian saves her and her partner. He brings her to his mansion desperate to heal her ~ to claim her. He is clearly gentle, tender and their love senes are incredibly hot. But . . . (*Don't hate me here*)For me, Lucian didn't seem as powerful as some of the other males (Mikhail, Gregori &amp; Darius). He seemed, well, rather mellow and that aura of menace that I thrilled to in Dark Legend was gone. I expected Lucian to be more like the males mentioned above. Since he had existed for endless centuries without a lifemate, constantly battling the darkness, I thought that his aura of menace would be much more evident as it was in DL.Despite my crazy quirks, Dark Guardian was a good read."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Ms. Feehan is a great author and I have all her books. Dark Magic is my favorite. The unique thing that I have always loved about the Dark Series is that the male, although very dominating, he does not wait until the end of the book to express his feelings for his lifemate and does everything he can to win her love which is so unlike the typical romance story.Lucian's story was a little different because this was the first time a Carpathian male agreed to allow his lifemate to hunt vampires with him. I was glad to see some interaction with Gabriel and his family and the mention of several others I've read about previously. I would love to see Ms. Feehan bring everyone together and update us on how they are doing.I did not give this book 5 stars because: I felt there was too much unnecessary killing done my Jaxon's stepfather and when he finally surfaces to kill Lucian, Jaxon just brushes off her \\"internal alarm system\\" and they never even get to confront \\"Uncle Tyler\\". A few more paragraphs on the wedding day scene would have been nice. I was disappointed that we did not get to witness Francesca and Jaxon's time together before the wedding.All in all, I still think this is a good book and I'm looking forward to Bryon's story in \\"Dark Symphony\\"."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I am a big fan of Christine Feehan, and I love her &quot;Dark&quot; series. Overall, I really enjoyed her newest installment in Dark Guardian. But there were a few quibbles that I had with the book that prevented me from giving it a higher rating. Mostly they centered around Jaxx, the heroine. When we first meet her and read about her life in the first chapter, I was looking for a completely different human heroine than what we have seen in the other Dark books. Since she was a policewoman, trained by the Navy Seals as a child, I thought she would be more centered and mature as a character. While there were some instances she displayed this throughout the book, overall I felt she was not as &quot;fleshed&quot; out as she could have been, especially considering her profession. At times I felt she was not deserving for the hero.However, Lucian was great. Perhaps it is because he is a true ancient, but he was very mellow and understanding, and allowed Jaxx more freedom than some other Carpathians we have read about. And I really was moved by the part were he tells Jaxx about the &quot;man&quot; who told him about Gabriel's lifemate. The end was also moving, in which we see a reunion of sorts with most of the Carpathians. Like I said, overall enjoyed this book, although not as much as Dark Legend, which was the story of Gabriel, Lucian's twin brother.But it kept me entertained and I look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"The world of Christine Feehan brings to us the story of Lucian and Jaxon. Lucian is one of the most powerful Carpathian male to hunt and find his lifemate. Jaxon is a wonderful, adaptable character that makes me proud to be a human woman. They have the right mix that gives a delicious balance to the story. I enjoyed the clashes between them. The fights and opinions remind me a lot of Mikhail and Raven in Dark Prince. This story has just the right amount of suspense and love. Once you began reading this book, you will not be able to put it down. It is definitely a keeper. I can't wait for the next installment in this saga. Keep writing Christine Feehan."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Jaxon \\"Jaxx\\" Montgomery has survived domestic violence though her brother and mother died at the hands of her stepfather.

However, a macho rookie Craig Benton ignores her order to retreat and charges inside the building setting off the ambush. Jaxx and her partner Barry Radcliff place themselves in danger to rescue Craig. Only the work of a wolf saves their lives.The wolf Lucien takes Jaxx to safety because he knows this feisty human is his life-mate. After living on the edge of the dark, he, like his twin brother before him, has finally found the woman that enables him to see colors in a world of black and white. Though Jaxx is drawn to the Carpathian she wonders if he is the magnet that brings the monster back to finish the incomplete slaughter he started years ago or is he the monster?The latest Carpathian vampire romance is an exciting entry that employs a human to refresh the tale of Lucien. The return of Lucien's sibling Gabriel and soul mate Francesca add a nice touch, as the audience will relish seeing them support the lead characters. Lucien remains a powerhouse of morality and Jaxx is a fine intrepid individual who is his perfect foil, but seems more Carpathian than human. DARK GUARDIAN is a wonderful novel that enhances the Christine Feehan universe completing the twist from DARK LEGEND with the strong story of one of the darker Carpathians.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Jaxon Montgomery has spent her entire life looking over her shoulder, waiting for her stepfather to strike once again.

Feehan creates an entire society - the Carpathians - whose original homeland was in what is now Romania, Moldova, (and perhaps part of western Ukraine).3) Carpathians have their own biological laws of existence...4) To add to this, new facts are discovered in almost every book, with the discord between old facts and new being explained by the failure to pass on knowledge between generations, thanks to a massive catastrophe...5) The balance of power between males and females is very uneven, partly because of the highly skewed sex ratio (a premise that I find fascinating), and partly because of the nature of male Carpathians themselves. This is shown in the relationships of males and females in each and every book, except in DARK GUARDIAN which is a bit unusual. [And of course, if you cannot stand the thought of vampires or vampire-like creatures, or intensely purple love scenes, avoid the entire series].Now to the review of this title proper:DARK GUARDIAN is the latest of the Carpathian (or Dark series) books to hit the shelves. Further books are forthcoming for those completely addicted, although they come out only once a year. The series starts with DARK PRINCE (where we meet the leader of this people), and is currently at the 8th book (not including a novella \\"Dark Dream\\").The hero of DARK GUARDIAN is highly unusual. Lucian is one of twin ancient Carpathians who have hunted vampires (male Carpathians who have \\"turned\\", or started killing their victims) for about 2000 years. It was far more fun reading about [Lucian] and speculating about his actions and motivations, than reading Gabriel's story. How does Lucian then fare in his book?...I have to confess that I ended up skipping the love scenes because they were too many, and too purple.The book disappointed me in the end, because of the ending...I have mixed feelings about the Dark series, after having read just about all the books (DARK GOLD aside). Some are clearly better than others, notably this one. Some are far more moving than others, and you feel that the hero and heroine are genuinely matched, as in DARK DESIRE. But as a whole... discrepancies between what was believed and what is now known are explained away too easily. There are also major discontinuities in chronology between the books (and the lifespans of the characters who appear in them).... In the Dark series, we are limited to about one hundred years (with the occasional unreliable flashback to some 500 years back). Feehan does American settings well, but she Americanizes her foreign settings (with no allowances for history, geography or local customs). I was attracted to the series by the idea of a society with a skewed sex-ratio, but Carpathian society and its mores is not exactly what I was looking for.Rating for this book = 4.3 (B+), deduction of 0.3 for the ending.Rating for the series as a whole = 3.3 (C+)Comment = series addictive on first couple of reads, but does not stand up well to close scrutiny."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I am a fan of Christine Feehan's books. I looked forward to this book but found it fell a little flat. Jaxxon started as a very complex character with tremendous potential but by the end of the book as flat and defined by one or two traits no where near as interesting as Destiny in Dark Destiny or Natalya in Dark Demon.Lucian had no challenge worthy of him to really push him to grow, although how you would do that with the greatest known Carpathian is a true creative challenge for Ms. Feehan. I would enjoy to see a challenge worthy of getting the twins back together. Seeing the interchange between the brothers shows a side you rarely get to see of the Carpathians. I would like to be a fly on the wall for a Daranatoff family reunion.Enjoyable read but she has not yet begun her major story arc with the mages and the Morrison institute. It is a stand alone work. Helpful to read Dark Legend first but not essential."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesLucian Daratrazanoff is a legend'one of the ancient Dark twins sent out over 1000 years ago by their former Prince to protect humans and Carpathians alike. His life was bleak, lacking color and emotion. The only thing that had kept him from turning vampire after all these years had been his dedication to his twin, Gabriel. Lucian had fooled everyone into thinking he had turned, to give his brother a mission to keep from turning himself. Once Gabriel found his lifemate, Lucian was ready to give up, allowing himself to be destroyed. But hope arrives at the last minute, giving Lucian a new reason for living' his own lifemate.Jaxon 'Jaxx' Montgomery is a brilliant and gifted cop, well respected by her fellow officers, and having survived a hellish young life. Her entire family, and anyone she has ever gotten close to, were brutally murdered by a former Navy SEAL, and her late father's best friend, Tyler Drake. She had spent the last several years of her life trying to avoid emotional entanglements with anyone, for fear Drake would fixate on them and start another murderous rampage. Lucian finds in her the one person who could bring color and feeling back into his bleak existence, and therefore refuses to allow her to keep her distance. He needs her and is determined to make Jaxon understand him.When Jaxx and her partner are nearly killed in a drug bust gone bad, Lucian steps in and rescues them, taking her to his home, unwilling to be separated from her. As she recovers from what should have been fatal injuries, Jaxx notices changes in her body, wrought by Lucian's healing and converting of her. She tries to convince him, it isn't safe to be around her, for Drake will stop at nothing, all the while finding herself drawn to Lucian.Lucian and Jaxon's path is not an easy one, for Drake is still out there, stalking them. There are also some very powerful vampires in the area, having been drawn by Jaxon's psychic abilities. Add in a dangerous drug lord, who is not pleased with her team's skills, interfering with his business, and their work is cut out for them, as they try to eliminate all of these threats to their happiness.This book is slightly different from past books in Ms. Feehan's Dark saga, but more than meets the expectations of her numerous fans. Lucian is very unique and this is reflected in the way the story is written. Jaxx is a very strong woman and is a perfect match for the most respected and feared of all Carpathians. He recognizes her special abilities and strengths, causing him to compromise far more than is typical for the males of his species, whose main purpose is to protect their lifemate at all costs. He makes an effort to accommodate her intelligence and her talents, allowing her to participate in dangerous activities where her abilities will help. However in spite of this, Lucian still does not take seriously the threat Drake poses to their lives, causing him to underestimate just what Drake will do.This tale is more plot-driven that most of the Dark series, full of action. But how can it not be, with the various subplots occurring? There is also more violence, due to the nature and number of villains present. One disappointment however, that this reviewer found, is the resolution of the Tyler Drake plotline. It is rather anticlimactic, one having expected more from him after the way he was presented in the story. This leaves the story to not be quite as satisfactory as it could be. In spite of this one issue, the book is fascinating and will keep the pages turning, in to the late hours of the night. The edge-of-the-seat drama keeps one intrigued and not wanting to stop until the story is ended. As always, Dark Guardian leaves the readers begging for more. One will be happy to know this saga is nowhere near complete, and there is still much filed away in Ms. Feehan's imagination for future books and enthralling characters."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"On an individual Basis I absolutely love every single one of the books in the Dark series. But once you have read one, you have read them all. The plot has only minor and insignificant changes from one book to the next. The studly, manly, overly protective Carpathian male must either fight an ancient and powerful vampire after his woman, or protect her from a fanatical group of vampire hunters. After the fifth book with the same plot I was totally fed up. The stories are fantastic, just read at least 4 non-vampire stories in between each of the Dark Books."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Dark Guardian is the latest in Feehan's Dark Series, a great set of romance novels about an \\"Old World\\" immortal, primarily nocturnal species called Carpathians who remain mostly unknown to humans. After a few centuries, the males lose all feelings of emotion, ability to see color, and risk losing their souls by turning into vampires (undead beings without conscience, seeking the thrill of the kill)... unless the men find the light to their darkness... their lifemates (female Carpathians, or psychic human females who can safely be converted to Carpathian without the risk of becoming vampiresses).I love this book --so far my favorite in the series--, but recommend starting at the beginning and moving forward in order: Dark Prince, Dark Desire, Dark Gold, Dark Magic, Dark Challenge, Dark Fire, Dark Legend, Dark Guardian (and the Dark Dream, which is one of three stories in an anthology book entitled After Twilight).My one and only complaint about this whole series is that Ms. Feehan over-uses a favorite catch phrase: He took her breath away... or She took his breath away... or He tells her, \\"You take my breath away.\\" Variations pop up repeatedly in each and every book! After reading 9 books, it gets old quick. But, I've learned to skip it and go on, because the rest is great!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"All of Feehan's Dark Series is excellent. Dark Fire, Dark Legend, and Dark Guardian are by far my favorite. Those three rank on my all time favorite romance list. Very sexy. Feehan now seems comfortable with her creation and has move on to start to write really strong FEMALE characters (the males were always strong). The main reason I fell in love with these books is the need and feeling of the male characters. While the first book's ladies can hold their own they seemed to me to get a touch whiney after a while. These are the first and only Vampire books I have ever read. Before these I could not fathom why there was even a sub genera like this. While it is not necessary to read all the books in order, most of the males carry over form previous books. I for one love to revisit couples I have read about before. Not for the faint of heart, blood shedding, and blood drinking play a heavy role in these books. All in all excellent, truly wonderful story line. Christine Feehan could not possibly write fast enough for me. *****"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"The Dark Guardian was well worth the wait,it answered some questions on why the brothers didn,t turn evil like the others of their era. Reading though has put more questions and hopefully answers in following books. Do they find a formula that will save the young carpathians, will there be a story where the twins meet up a do battle with their younger siblings. I'm totally hooked on the series and have gotton my son's girlfriend hooked when I knew Gabriel's story was coming out I reread the intire series and was finish just in time to read about Gabriel and waited some what patiently for Luscian's.

Instead it seemed to me that she spent a lot of time stomping her foot, rather than taking action.Lucian on the other hand...wow! His character is incredibly kind and generous with Jaxx. He allows Jaxon to do things that no other Carpathian male would allow.Feehan does a great job of building the tension between the two characters, culminating in her trademark *steamy* scenes.

So the few days it took me to read it, I really enjoyed it immensely.Afterwards, I sought to get more books from the same series... and I've been hugely disappointed. It feels to me like it's always the same basics. Different characters, different bad guys, but same storyline all the time. I'm on my 4th book and I'm not sure I'll be reading any more after that.Dark Prince was great because it was interesting to discover Mikhail and Gregori... but I'm currently reading Dark fire and it's just \\"same old, same old\\". Yeah, the characters are new, but the story is just the same. Beautiful girl found by equally handsome Carpathian guy, who makes her his lifemate, bla bla, bla bla.Dark guardian stood out in the way that it was a whole new universe for me. I found the sex scenes well written too. But then again, I skipped most of them in Dark Prince, there were just too many!!!I don't know, I'm not sure I'll read more.My advice if you're getting started on this series: choose your first book well, as it'll probably end up being your favourite. and you don't need to read all the books in order, because you'll get all your explanations in whatever book you choose.I thought the Anita Blake series (Laurell K Hamilton) was becoming a bit.. boring, but each book is still very different from the previous one. And sadly, it's not the case for Christine Feehan's books. A shame."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Christine Feehan continues to pull me into her Carpathian world.

It doesn't even seem like it was written by Christine Feehan. The two main characters had no depth.

This one hit the spot, now we have to wait FOREVER for the next installment. :0)"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Knowing me to be a lover of vampire-fiction, a friend recommended these books ... Spurred by this recommendation I actually went out and BOUGHT two of them (a student's income usually relegates one to digging them out of bins at Woolies).Not my smartest move.Predictable plot lines, characters that were like cardboard and had all the spirit of drugged garden snails.

It was interesting to have a female \\"human\\" character who actually knew how to take care of herself in a battle. Jaxon is strong and mostly self-sufficient except in the matter of the heart, which makes Lucian not merely a guardian, but also a lover and friend first, and foremost a 'modern' Carpathian even though he is two thousand years old.Some of the scenes were gore, but it didn't really bothered me. The plot is well written and though I would have like a more 'face to face' battle with the bad guy, the love story and the battle story were well done. Not really a book to read before bedtime but wonderful on a stay-in-bed morning."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Lucian is by far the sexiest Carpathian yet!

Carpathian males searching for their lifemate to keep them from turning into Vampires. However, it is a fun and quick read. It definately gets the blood flowing with the sexual content and at the same time is written with a romantic side. Good for a quick, fun read without having to think to much."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Love all of Feehan's books. Especially love the twist at the end of this book between Lucian and his twin brother."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"What do I say? Christine Feehan writes good stories with likeable characters. This is a good read but then I haven't yet found one of hers that I didn't like."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"If you like the other books by Christine Feehan, you will love this book. It is one of the Dark series. This hero is even more alpha than most, yet with a vulnerability that makes him imminently lovable. Paired with a young woman of strength, passion and independence, the feelings between the two grow as they come to know and respect each other as the people they are. A true romance."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Having lived for over two thousand years, Lucian is one of the oldest, most powerful Carpathians. He is what they call an Ancient. His twin brother has found his lifemate, who is a healer. She tells Lucian he has a lifemate out there as well, a miracle he had completely given up hoping for. Her name is Jaxon, a human cop, who has been stalked by a madman since she was a child.I love how Feehan creates entirely different personalities for each lifemate. Jaxx is no exception. She absolutely cracked me up. Jaxx teases Lucian relentlessly, and she also adapted quickly when converted to a Carpathian, learning much more than human lifemates in previous novels. Now this isn't because she had less fear of the Carpathian lifestyle than the other human women. She was actually scared to death. But she leaned more Carpathian skills than the others, because she is stubborn and competitive and a cop. She really is a hoot and quite endearing. This novel was such a delight I didn't want it to end. No kidding."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"It's important to read Dark Legend before reading this book. Some books in this series can be read as a stand alone but if you try that with this one you'll be missing something special.This was my second favorite book in this series. A few of the ones in the middle felt redundant to me but this one was fresh and fun again. Strangely I stopped reading the series after this one. Maybe I just wanted to end on a good note."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have just fell in love with the writings of Christine Feehan, dark fanstay,romance and adventure at the time. The Carpathian males never give up, \\"they always get their woman\\". It took me 2.5 days to finish reading this book. I would have finished it sooner if not for having to go to sleep and going to work. Lucian is everyone woman dream. Sexy, protective, tall dark and handsome and not afraid to tell or show is true feelings. I like the fact that Lucian's lifemate was different than the typical Carpathian females (tall, slender w/dark long hair). Jaxon had blonde hair, short, and a career (cop), which meant she could face just about anything. Jaxon stared fear in the face, now thats \\"Girl Power\\". After reading this book I wanted more."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I had only read one of the Dark Guardian series (Dark Desire) and kind of liked it--it was a good summer read. Since the reviews indicated that Feehan tended to use the same plot device over and over, I read the descriptions about the other books and bought Dark Guardian since it sounded interesting.It was vaguely interesting although I found the part about her stepfather killing everyone she loves over the years a little far fetched. However Ms. Feehan was either unable or unwilling to develop the plot more fully so she added lots of sex scenes between the two leading characters. And I mean a lot. She writes in great detail about them making love, and then afterwards they have a short conversation and then go at it again. I started skimming through the sex about three-fourths of the way through the book. And how many times can he thrust his fingers into her hot sheath? Many times apparently---I wanted to scream: find another descriptive phrase!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I found this book to be a much better read then the other 'Dark' books I've read.However,I felt the author should have made Jaxon more objective to her 'Carpathian' transformation, instead of calmly accepting it. After all she is supposed to have a very independent nature!The other complaint I have about this book is the use of the word 'honey'Come on, Lucian is 2000yrs old, with Old World manners. So, wouldn't he use terms of endearment he learnt eons ago before he lost all emotion, and since his speech tends to reflect this, instead of the modern day endearments?Except for those 2 objections, I enjoyed the book and found I couldn't put it down, till I reached the end. The chemistry between the H/H was great, very believeable.A star less, because of the two complaints."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"i enjoyed the twist in this novel, where Jaxon is haunted by a very menacing human terror rather than just a vampire terror. This book also has the first real castle in the series, yet Christine Feehan makes it sound very home-like."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Finally Lucian (probably the most powerful carpathian) & Jaxon's story!After reading the 9 first books in the series, i'll have to say that this one is one of the best along with dark magic.a must read!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"If you read no other book in the Carpathian series, you must read this one. Lucien is the finest of all the heroes introduced in this series. His humility, compassion, humor and understanding of others is without equal, perhaps because of his meeting with a very special person 2,000 years ago? This book is a treasure that I will reread many times and keep forever till it finally falls apart."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"For two centuries, Carpathians and vampires alike thought Lucian and Gabriel dead, with some claiming that the twins killed each other after Lucian apparently became one of the undead and his twin hunted him down. But in modern day Paris, the truth is finally unveiled when the greatest warriors rise from their long slumber. In DARK LEGEND (Gabriel's story), we are told about Lucian's sacrifice when after learning that his twin had a lifemate and sensing that Gabriel was on the verge of losing his soul, he pretended to be a vampire knowing that Gabriel would hold out to honor the vows they made to one another, which is to hunt the other one down if they ever succumbed to darkness. Now in this action-packed novel, it is Lucian's turn to finally meet his lifemate.After two thousand years of lonely existence, but satisfied in the knowledge that he prevented his twin from turning to ultimately unite him with his lifemate, the greatest existing warrior of their species comes to America in search of his lifemate. But what Lucian didn't expect was to find a woman who couldn't be more different from a typical Carpathian woman who is tall, dark-haired and peaceful, for Jaxon Montgomery is the exact opposite, with her short stature, shaggy blond hair and fiery spirit. But Lucian knows he has found his salvation in the 'walking arsenal' who has suffered greatly from the terrible burden she's been carrying since she was a young girl.Jaxon grew up in the company of Navy Seals, which her father was once a member of until his untimely death. When Jaxon's mother married Tyler Drake, who was Jaxon's father best friend, no one suspected that the guy was demented until it was too late. Tyler murdered Jaxon's mother and brother, then her foster family shortly after. From then on, she has avoided getting close to anyone, aware of the threat to other people's lives due to Tyler's obsession with her. So why, after having resigned herself to always being alone is she drawn to a virtual stranger who claims that she is his lifemate? Why does the thought of being apart from him leave her feeling empty and more alone than ever?DARK GUARDIAN is a witty and exciting novel that had me glued from the very first page. I enjoyed the banter between Lucian and Jaxon. She is dynamite in a small package, able to stand up to Lucian's arrogance and keep him in his place. And I never expected for Lucian to possess such humor. I mean this is a powerful Carpathian who is able to destroy from a distance with his voice alone, a man who has been void of emotions for over a thousand years, and yet finds delight in his verbal sparring with the tiny cop whom he describes as a walking arsenal.Fun and enjoyable, this book also has the most wonderful ending of the Dark Series so far. I totally loved it!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Okay, i've basically read this series from the begining and this is as far as i've got. I realise that it's gotten a bit monotonous; that caracters eventually say exactly the same thing, using exactly the same dialogue. I gave this book 4 stars however, because i thought the battle scene was well written compared to others, Jaxon's role in it was unusual because Carpathian females do not fight vampires period. I was also pleased with the idea of the kind of wedding/family reunion at the end though i'm ticked that we don't actually get to 'see' the gathering. I get the feeling that a book where they all get together would be fun and funny. In any case, i got a nice warm and fuzzy feeling after reading this one, i strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"From the prologue to the end, this novel will surely keep you hooked. The dark sensuality of Lucian is simply enticing. It is so delicious and, not to mention, envy-worthy, to witness his possession, as well as need of Jaxx.Lucian is a very powerful Carpathian, well-respected by his own kind as well as feared by the darker creatures of the underworld. He has lived for about two thousand years, but now has come the time when he has to find his mate so as to not be converted into a vampire--the race of evil that he has unrelentingly fought and hunted for the entirety of his existence. Seeing vivid color for the first time in his life upon meeting Jaxon made him realize that, at last, he has found his lifemate.Jaxx is a cop who has made it her life's aim to protect people. The traumatic events in her childhood has made her strong--and the last thing she wanted was to be dependent on anyone else. So it came as a surprise when Lucian comes into her life and starts to make her feel that she needed this man. Lucian subtly and steadily broke down her defenses, overpowering her with his fierce possession and unconditional love.The beauiful facet of this story is that, Lucian was prepared to wait until Jaxx realized that she loved him as much as he loved her. I enjoyed the encounters both Jaxx and Lucian had when Jaxx finally became a Carpathian. Of course, the steamy love scenes were an added bonus!This is simply one of the most romantic, sensual, and exciting stories ever written. It has the elements of passion, humor, action and suspense. After you read this book, im sure you're gonna yearn to have someone like Lucian in your life! :p"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I love Christine Feehan's books and this was no different. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel. The suspense of when Jaxon's stepfather was going to strike and who he would kill was built up throughout the book. The ending then disappointed me. The suffering that the stepfather had inflicted on Jaxon was so great that I felt he should have had a battle with Jaxon or a more gruesome ending than how he was dealt with at the end. My friend who read the book also agreed with me. The book was great until the ending. It disappointed me so much that I am only giving this 3 stars. The book is worth reading but readers will find the final battle a disappointment."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I'm a fan of Christine Feehan's Dark series and have read them all so I was eager to devour Dark Guardian. Unfortunately, Lucian and Jaxon's story is a major disappointment, especially when compared to its great predecessor, Dark Legend. In Legend, Lucian is a complex, menacing character. In Guardian, he definitely pales but I must give him major brownie points for putting up with Jaxon's whining. The chemistry between Jaxon and Lucian is tepid, the plot is thin and the redundant dialogue quickly grows tiresome. Even the villain is weak. His maniacal behavior isn't adequately explained. A great opportunity to have an evil, frightening character never materializes, and the final confrontation is a major letdown.Feehan usually hits the mark. Dark Guardian desperately needs a transfusion."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Again Christine does not disapoint with her dark series, very stong charaters, learning to accept differances,and life changes. action packed"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have a number of these in paperback and was very glad to find one that I haven't read before"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Get your book,a quiet place,an get ready to stay awhile.

I have since read and own all of them.I keep these around around and re-read at least once a year. Strong male and female characters.I think I like this one the most because of the first chapter. Being the first one I read, it caught me with the vivid descriptions of the twins fighting the Turks. I immediately thought I'd love to see this as a movie.Steamy sex, good love story and the female character isn't so wishy washy that you keep thinking get over it!This series is now an old friend I pull out when I want to just sit back and escape into another world."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"It amazes me how Christine Feehan has created a race of people called the Carpathians, developed several books about the different characters in this race, and still manages for each book to be refreshing, sexy, and suspenseful. Where does this woman get her inspiration for her leading men?Dark Guardian is Lucian's story. He is the most powerful, elite warrior of the Carpathians. In fact he is the guardian of his race. Now he has met the woman who can change his existence. She can give him back his emotions, sense of color, and ability to love. She is Jaxon Montgomery, a police officer who has spent her life trying to survive the destruction of her childhood, the death of not only her family, but her adopted family, on the constant lookout for the man who will kill anyone who gets too close to her-her stepfather.Lucian, in order to protect Jaxon, makes her into a Carpathian. He takes away her ability to be in the sun, take nourishment from foods. She must now exist on blood like him, but in return gains powers she never knew existed. Together they learn to coexist while taking care of the bad guys.This is a pretty neat story and like all of Feehan's books, almost impossible to review because you just have to read them to get all the details. Ms. Feehan writes one of the most complex series in paranormal romance. If you haven't tried one of her books, grab one and I really feel you'll be searching for all of them. Ms. Feehan has it all in her books--paranormal, excitement, sex, suspense, gorgeous leading men-everything."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Having read all of the books thus far I have to say Dark Guardian is my favorite to date. I think most fans of the Dark series were eager to see Lucian finally find some happiness after his sacrifices for his brother in Dark Legend. The many transformations of the helpless girlie psychics was kind of getting old in the other books so it was a refreshing change to see Jaxx just roll with it and keep going. No hysterics for this heroine! Lucian was the first of the Carpathians to really display a distinct difference in his manner after finding his lifemate and the playfulness of their relationship was fun to read.I have to say the premise is getting kind of old for this series but they are still very well written."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"As a rule, I am loving the Dark series and am thrilled there are so many of them. I started with this one (number 8) but wasn't at sea at all.However, the descriptions of how small Jaxx is borders on the ridiculous, and I've noticed this in many other Dark books with the exception of Dark Symphony. Jaxx sounds like a child midget. I got very tired of the constant repetition of how tiny she was, how small, how frail, how petite, etc. etc. This has been repeated with Dark Prince and Dark Desire, where the heroines are also miniature pixies, and it's annoying.That said, these are wonderful books and I love the old-world machismo. For those who get upset that the men are overbearing, look at it from their point of view - look at their lives without their lifemates (bleak, empty, with the horrifying temptation to turn vampire unless they commit suicide) and look at what these women can give to these men. These books raise the loving sacrifice of self for another to a high art, and that's a really beautiful thing."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have read every single book in the Dark series and have liked most of them, especially the later ones. The one thing that bothers me the most about each female is that they have a tendency to dwell on the actions of their Carpathian lifemates and retain anger about them, thereby extending needless conflict. I prefer Jaxon's character because, once converted, she accepts Lucian's action. She can't reverse the process, and there is no point in railing at him because she loves him and knows the reasons behind what he did. More to the point, I love the fact that she learns to control her new powers and not fear being a Carpathian (extremely unlike Raven from Dark Prince, whose constant irrational fear sets my teeth on edge). She is strong in her own right and fights by Lucian's side, which in itself sets this book apart from the rest of the series. Perhaps her best characteristic is her sense of humor, which is only shared by one other female character, Tempest Trine from Dark Fire. Levity is important in any book, and Ms. Feehan acheives it here in moments that should be serious but end up being delightfully captivating because of the interaction between Lucian and Jaxon. I prefer Jaxon as a female character because she has what most other romance heroines lack: common sense."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Jaxon Montgomery kept herself isolated from all others, being careful not to make friends or spend too much time with anyone else. She was trained as a Navy SEAL and is now a police officer, confident in her abilities and well able to protect herself - except from her stepfather. When Jaxx told others that her stepfather had murdered her Navy SEAL father to marry her mother, she was laughed at and no one believed her. But then they found the brutally slaughtered bodies of Jaxx's younger brother and fragile mother and a few started to believe. When her stepfather returned to kill the family who adopted her, the family of another Navy SEAL, Jaxx refused to endanger anyone else and kept to herself. She feared that anyone else that she showed affection to would be murdered, but she didn't want to be alone...Lucian was the most powerful of the Carpathians - and the most ancient. For thousands of years he has walked the earth, hunting vampires and protecting the innocent. He even pretended to be a vampire for hundreds of years so that his twin, Gabriel (Dark Legend), would hunt him and not turn vampire. The only thing that kept him from meeting the dawn was the thought that his life mate was out there somewhere, waiting for him...Jaxx was not at all what Lucian had envisioned in his life mate. Carpathian women are tall, slender with raven hair and jewel bright eyes, Jaxx is short with short blonde hair and a spunky attitude. Sparks definitely fly when Lucian carries Jaxx off to the safety of his mansion, telling all of her acquaintances that he is her fiance. Jaxx fears Lucian, but, deep in her heart, she knows that she can trust him. However, she also knows that her stepfather will start hunting Lucian if he doesn't let her go soon and she cannot bear to have another person killed on her account. She tries her best to protect Lucian, but he doesn't seem to understand the danger. Lucian is not sure what to make of Jaxx. He is the most powerful of his kind and it is almost laughable that this little human thinks she can protect him from anything. Both sides will have to adjust their thinking as they fall deeper and deeper in love and Jaxx comes to terms with being a Carpathian life mate!I loved Lucian as a character. We last saw him in Dark Legend where he tried to end his life rather than face an eternity alone, but he was persuaded to live because his life mate was out there and needed him. And if anyone needed a dark hero more, it is Jaxx Montgomery. I thought Jaxx was a great heroine and very different from all of Ms. Feehan's other heroines. When Jaxx said that she wanted to help Lucian hunt the bad guys, she meant it - and she had the skills to back it up, unlike most of the other females. Jaxx was tough, but she wasn't bitter and she was still very feminine. This is just a beautiful love story - you are all in for a treat!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Dark Guardian presents Lucien who for the last several hundred years has pretended to be a vampire in order to safeguard his brother, Gabriel. Lucien at Francesca's (Gabriel's lafemate) word, searches out Jaxon Montgomery, a cop who is haunted by an abusive step father. He had killed her family and foster family, and anyone else who he percieved as being a threat to his relationship with Jaxon (this being anyone she grows close to.) Jaxon is afraid for Lucien despite his tremendous abilities, fearing he will be overconfident that no human could be a threat to him. Lucien is determined to help Jaxon move beyond her past once he finds her.If you are new to Christine Feehan, I recommend you start with Dark Prince because these novels have an overarching storyline that holds them all together, and characters from earlier novels tend to pop up."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I have to admit I am new to the dark series but that takes away from none of the fun. if your new as well this book is a great place to start since it doesn't have that many references to the other books.Lucian is one of the most powerful carpathian's in the world. So powereful that he sacrifced himself and pretended to be a vampire so that his twin brother wouldn't turn into a vampire (Dark Legend). Carpathian's are a race that drink blood but don't kill. There good but if they don't find there lifemate they either turn into a vampire or decide to go into the light. They need a lifemate because they shed light into there souls.Lucian finds his lifemate in Jaxon a strong ladycop who can take care of herself. He recuses her from a fire and takes her back to his mansion to protect her. When Jaxon wakes she tries to get Lucian to let her go. Throughout her life everyone she has come to care about has been killed by her stepfather and she knows that it's not possible for her to have a normal relationship in her life. ...There's plenty of danger and suspense as well. For anyone into the supernatural or the romantic the book. The whole series (which I am starting to read) is a great read!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I adore this entire series and I have just finished Dark Guardian and I'm on to the next one. I have to say that I get a little annoyed by Jaxxon and all the women like her who are all \\"Sex me Sex me\\" but then two seconds later are like \\"I want my freedom ya' BIG Jerk\\" It frustrates me to no end.I loved Dark Legend and Aiden's story as well. I recommend these to everyone just maybe not so much Dark Guardian."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Okay, I admit it, I didn't like Dark Guardian. And I've liked ALL of feehan's other Carpathian books, including Dark Gold.First, I really wanted to read more about the character's relationship. Instead there was a long convoluted subplot involving the main villain which dominated too much of the book.Second, Jaxxon (hate the name, reminds me of Michael Jackson, or Dax from DS9, and the double xx's just kept leaping out at me on every page), and Lucien didn't have the same 'spark' as some of the other characters in this series.Third, given how powerful Lucien is, I was really, really surprised he didn't blow the villain out of the water on page three. Instead Lucien procrastinates doing anything about him until three-quarters through the book. Very unrealistic Carpathian behavior if you ask me.Fourth, Where is Gabriel? Lucien's twin was absent during most of the book, and I kept wondering WHY. If Gabriel suspected his brother was having trouble with the villain, he would certainly call Julian, or one of the other Carpathian heavies. Instead... He does nothing. Very out of character. Especially considering how close these two are supposed to be.The good news, is Feehan manages to squeeze several decent romantic scenes in between hunts for the evil stalker. But even these scenes fell flat for me, because I kept expecting Lucien or Jaxx to \\"Do\\" something about the villain.This novel would've been vastly improved with less attention paid to the villain, and more character development between Jaxx and Lucien. Even at the end of this book, I was never quite sure Jaxx and Lucien had enough commonalities to forge a strong relationship."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"Dark Guardian is an improvement over its predecessor in the series. Feehan was able to add some variety in characterization, but the premise is getting old. Maybe it's time for a super FEMALE Carpathian?"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"This is the first book in the dark series since the first two (Dark Prince and Dark Desire) where I really like both the Carpathian male and his lifemate. Lucian, probably the most powerful of the Carpathians along with his twin brother Gabriel, finally finds a lifemate after keeping Gabriel alive for so many years until he'd found his. At the end of Dark Legend (which is Gabriel's story) Lucian asks Gabriel to kill him so he won't have to go on living a lonely and desolate existence. Gabriel attempts to do so but is stopped by his own lifemate who swears that Lucian will find his lifemate soon and must hold on to life until he does. Jaxon becomes the woman of Lucian's dreams but there is one big difference between Jaxon and most of the other female lifemates--she won't just sit by and let Lucian do all the fighting. He may be powerful, but Jaxon won't take any chances with his life. She will have his back or he will do no fighting at all. And Lucian allows this, because unlike most other Carpathian males, most notably Gregori, he will not quell his lifemate's aspirations. He accepts Jaxon as his equal which is one of the reasons that this book really worked for me. I also absolutely loved the ending and I love that Gabriel shows up often as a voice in Lucian's head and vice versa. Another very interesting point in this novel is that Lucian met Jesus Christ some two thousand years earlier and desribes him as a truly beautiful and guileless mind. I really loved that picture. Feehan, rock on!"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I was reading \\"The Dark Series\\" books.This book has Dark Dream,wich is the 7th book.

A cop that was train by navy seals, her name is jaxon. So as you can imagine what this mean to poor Lucian a ancient with no idea how to deal with a mortal woman that is soft like feather and that fights like rambo, that is determined to proctect him , like he need any proctection, he is a vampire hunter after all , from a lunatic responsible for her father and everybody that she care about ...P>Humm this is really got alot of action in the story.... But I haven't seen yet a heroine that really fight next to her men, and kick vampires all over, I like that kind of heroines.....hummjust kind like xena you know any way.......you will not be dessapoint it with any of the heroines in the dark serie they all drive their lifemates crazy with their right to be independetbut in the end they all realize that it is wort it to give their old lifes to be with this handsome dark men, I would too.So enjoy the books.Savannahmb"},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I am a Christine Feehan junkie!

So steamy arousing. Sometimes I feel as if these books of hers are written totally from a man's mind though(please don't take offense Christine). Men would diffidently enjoy reading them just from what many men think are a woman's reaction to their sexual prowess. The women only wish it were so. Read and enjoy women.I could do with more of the suspense or mystery. Also, the romance gets to be so detailed steamy too often in the middle of what should be action (I roll my eyes and want to skip).

However, this book is really more of a romance novel than a diehard vampire novel, and it seems to get somewhat sappy at times, especially the parts about the 'delicate, fragile, vulnerable' Jaxon (female lead)and her quote unquote 'savior' Lucian. In truth it almost reminds me of daytime soaps. The romantic scenes are also quite repetetive in nature. If you like that type of romantic novel, this may be for you, but if you prefer heavier on mystery/vamps and slightly less on romance, I would recommend Blackwood Farm(Anne Rice) or Crimson City (Liz Maverick)."},{"Title":"Dark Guardian","review":"I want you all to know this is not the only vampire romance series i have read but by far it has been the best.

Highly recommended!Wolf Child and Human Child tells the life story of Kamala, the wolf girl of India. In October of 1920 Kamala and Amala were \\"rescued\\" from their wolf den by Reverend Joseph Singh, a missionary in charge of an orphanage in Northern India. Gesell's book is based on Reverend Singh's diary of the two girls.Kamala's story starts in the Spring of 1912 when she is born. It is thought that she is around six months old when she is taken by a wolf from the side of a field, as her mother works nearby. She is nourished by the milk of the mother wolf and kept warm by huddling with the other wolf cubs. Kamala learns to run on all four, she eats raw meat and carrion and howls throughout the night. She becomes wolf-like, craving meat, seeing in the dark, and requiring no clothing in the cold. Sometime along the way another baby is taken in and the mother wolf raises 2 wolf children. When they are found Kamala is 8 and Amala is 18 months.In the Fall of 1920 there is word that there are two ghostly images running with the wolves. Reverend Joseph Singh sets up watch post high in a tree and sees two wolf-like children running on hands and feet along with the wolves. They decide to capture and \\"rescue\\" the children. They take them to a home in the village where they are left for a week with no food or water. They are then taken to an orphanage run by Singh. The change was not easy for anyone. The girls ran on all fours, lapped their drinks, and stayed outside howling through the night.Amala, being 18 months old, adapted much more quickly than Kamala. She was using words and giving up her wolf like behaviors quite willingly. Kamala's change took much more time and energy. Although Kamala did say a few words and eventually walked upright, she never reached adult capabilities. Gesell summed up Kamala's progress, saying that at the age of 16, after nine years in the care of the orphanage, she still had the mind of a three and a half year old. Gesell feels that Kamala\`s story shows us how mentally naked we are born and how much society and culture mold who we are.Wolf Child and Human Child: Being a Narrative Interpretation of the Life History of Kamala, the Wolf Girl is a fascinating book for anyone interested in feral children. The book touches on language acquisition as well as the theories of nature vs. nurture. I would recommend that anyone who reads this book takes the time to read the actual diary of Reverend Joseph Singh, it is a valuable resource to show the behavior and adaptation of these feral children."},{"Title":"Far from Home","review":"This was an absolute beautiful novel.

Historian of the British Empire and Venice, intrepid world traveller whose books are always enriched by well judged doses of historical detail, she has a fine direct style and an eye for the unusual. &quot;Fifty Years of Europe&quot; is described as an album because it consists of dozens of short essays and fragments written over a period spanning World War II to the nineties. Morris tries to lend some coherence to this collage by grouping the entries under thematic headings, but it's hard to escape the feeling that the book is an attempt to patch together bits and pieces from various writer's notebooks kept over the years. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, and Jan Morris is nothing if not a good raconteur, so the book provides plenty of browsing pleasure. Morris fans will enjoy it, but if you are a newcomer I would suggest that you start with her books on Oxford, Manhattan, Venice or (for history buffs) the magnificent Pax Britannica trilogy."},{"Title":"Fifty Years of Europe: An Album","review":"An extraordinarily informative and entertaining look at Europe's fascinatingly varied history and landscape.

Spring's characters and situations are complex, and the action typically has a reality (not to be confused with toughness) missing from many mystery novels.I am dismayed and bewildered by the negative comments from the New England reader who apparently wanted Spring to have written another book, one with predictable feminist role models. One of Spring's strengths is the very lack of predictablity--her characters are as rich in detail and complex motivation as people we know.I too heard Spring speak at PCA and I was impressed by the candor,intelligence, and passion of her remarks. She is a superb writer who lets us live a scene with her characters, and she thinks deeply about what she does with her books.Starting with &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; I have been hooked by Michelle Spring, and I can hardly wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"Nights In White Satin' by Michelle SpringAt the Cambridge May ball, on a warm balmy magical evening in June, amidst champagne, smoked salmon, music and laughter, young, pretty Katie Arkwright disappears.In this, the forth in the series featuring Laura Principal, Private Investigator, Aardvark Investigations had been retained to repel gatecrashers and maintain security at the Cambridge May Ball.

It's also about choices, and the guilt that comes from fast actions that we think will solve an immediate problem and then we find that we maybe cannot live with them. also the resulting pain.It's also a first class mystery, which I urge you all to read.

This mystery packs a wallop. Very terse and sensitive at the same time. Spring \`s novels highlight a feminist perspective in detective fiction. Each of her novels calls attention to a social issue that particularly affects women--even Standing in the Shadows can be viewed from that vantage point. Its strong stuff. And, Laura Principal is terrific!"},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN involves unpleasant goings-on in Cambridge (England), beautiful sunny summer days on the river, a breathtaking description of Piccadilly Circus, and a chance to know more about private investigator Laura Principal. Michelle Spring's language is vivid, sensuous, and suspenseful, and it really brought the city of Cambridge to life. Laura Principal is a wonderfully complex character, and I look forward to reading more about her. By the way, this is fourth in the series; I've not read the first two, but I do recommend the third, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"The board sponsoring the Cambridge May Ball at St. Johns hires private investigator Laura Principal to coordinate security. The event honors those students who have completed three years of grueling work at Cambridge with a party. Nothing happens during the gala, but the next day the police question Laura pertaining to Katie Arkwright, who left the party early and has not been seen since.The college hires Laura to discreetly inquire into what happened to Katie. Laura quickly learns that Katie had a waitressing job at an all male drinking club located on the St. Bart's campus. She also finds out that an ugly sexual incident occurred at the club. Stephen Fox, the senior tutor at the college believes Katie was partially to blame over the incident. Other evidence makes it seem that Katie was hooking. Two more incidents happen, but before Laura can follow up, someone kills Stephen. When data from the sixties surface, Laura realizes just how complex her simple investigation has become.NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN show that women have come a long way since the sixties, but have a long way to go before they can be considered receiving equal treatment. Cambridge is a hot bed of male chauvinism where a woman is stereotyped as a Madonna (virgin type that is) or a prostitute. Laura Principal has done an excellent job of illustrating her theory that most women will probably support even as most men will disagree. The villains in this novel are caricatures of men who think women have one job, spreading their legs. More than just a well-designed mystery, this Laura Principal provides a damning social commentary on society's double standard. This work is a definite winner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"I was quite horrified to read the comments on &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; from &quot;reader in New England&quot;. Michelle Spring is a gifted writer of FICTION. Whatever issues you have with how males and females are portrayed in society or in literature, it does not change the fact that this is a first rate novel. I'm sorry you didn't find Ms. Spring's characters to your liking, but many of us do. This, to me, was by far the best of the series so far."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"I'm not much of a mystery, but was taking a class on the mystery novel at school and this was one of the books assigned. Maybe it's me, but it's always seemed to me that the detective should be responsible for the resolution of the case. Not here. Everything turns out nicely without the detective actually having solved the case. Furthermore, Spring's prose didn't do much for me. Her paratactic sentences felt forced, rather than displaying natural speech rhythms.Not a satisfying read at all."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"Many mysteries depend to a certain extent on coincidence, but this one seems to do so because it's too lazy to do anything else. There is little tension, little excitement, little reason to care about any of the people in the book. The main character muses on this and that as she makes her way around Cambridge, but her observations seem shallow and obvious. The one piece of real history that is discussed touches tangentially on the plot but without adding any depth. Motivations for various actions are plopped onto the page, stirred for a bit, and then left half baked.Save your money."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"This book was SUCH a disappointment to me. I couldn't wait to finish it, and when I did I had to groan out loud. There is NO mystery here - just a stupid, boring story where the author spends endless, mind-numbing pages describing completely non-sensical &quot;tidbits&quot; about the heroine. Why must I read for 2 paragraphs about a bike ride she took as a child, or why she hates squirrels, or how her uncle kissed her? I skipped entire pages of this book because they were nothing but bizarre descriptions of things that were COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story. And, the story was so bad, it didn't make up for it. A waste of time."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"I have to believe that the praise given this book is due more to the generally poor quality of mystery paperbacks than to this novel's merits.There is little mystery, and (worse) little characterization. The novel's story line provides a fine but unrealized opportunity for Michelle Spring to explore issues of mysogyny and class. Yes, I know we read for entertainment, but if a novel merely exploits rather than explores serious social issues, let's admit it rather than pretend.Neither the novel's investigator nor its criminals are interesting The subplot of the investigator's strained romantic relationship is similarly shallow, a storybook ending in which the male finally realizes, without our finding out quite how, that his career obsession is less important than the series' heroine.I wanted this book to be good because I knew that it dealt with misogyny, but the novel doesn't go beyond telling us that some or many men are pigs. I want Michelle Spring's insights, not this truism.The most loathesome and dangerous of the males here is just a Hollywood-style sociopath. How about some attention to motivation?In an interesting talk to the Popular Culture Association in New Orleans (April 2000), Ms. Spring talked about being fascinated by the phenomenon of some college women turning tricks not out of economic necessity but out of a modern attitude (and desire for expensive clothes). The book involves such prostitution but never provides insights or, for that matter, makes this prostitution intrinsic to the plot. It would have been nice to have at least one character represent the position of some feminists that prostitution should be coinsidered a legitimate economic choice.Ms. Spring told us about interviewing several young women in Cambridge, at least one of whose stories was far more interesting than that of her fictional counterpart here. Perhaps in a concession to queasy readers, Ms. Spring is coy about whether the young women in question actually turned tricks, or just did receptionist duties at a brothel.If this Laura Principal series is among the most feminist of the mystery genre, we have a long way to go. It is not enough to have intelligent and capable women in lead roles, and sociopathic males preying on women as the criminals.The best part of the novel, I thought, was its reference to a dark chapter in Cambridge history, when in essence the university imprisoned (essentially enslaved) women of &quot;loose morals&quot; whom we would think, today, had been unwillingly exploited by well to do males and the ruling class institutions.THIS is the story Michelle Spring should have written, if she has a taste for historical fiction."},{"Title":"Nights in White Satin","review":"This is the first book I have read by Michelle Spring.

The girl who was missing was...and I don't appreciate that kind of ending for a mystery book. I was blown away by the murderer and other non-suspect who did it-incredible! I have to congratulate her on that!!! Any way, not the way I expected it to turn out, but it was a very good book."},{"Title":"The book of strangers","review":"I came across this book entirely by chance, and only picked it up because the back cover claimed that it was the &quot;Sufi Siddhartha.&quot; Being already interested in Sufism, my curiosity was piqued. And once having read it, I felt compelled to read it again and again. This is no mere introduction to either Sufism or Islam in a purely intellectual sense, as is so common in Western books on the subject. Still less is it a &quot;novel&quot; intended to amuse. Rather, it is an allegory of one postmodern, Westernized individual's journey into the Islamic Tradition. As such, I found it to be just as powerful as some of the classic allegories and poems written by the great Sufi masters of the medieval period. The plot is very simple: the story is narrated by a young man who works in a University library at some point in the near future. He is appointed to head the library after the disappearance of its former keeper. In this time, libraries are no longer merely buildings which house books, but they have been reduced to processing stations in which computers select and digest materials for scholars and students in such a manner that nothing will distract them from their area of specialization. However, the narrator becomes curious, and begins trying to solve the mystery of the previous librarian's disappearance. He soon comes across the missing man's journal, which contains the story of his growing dissatisfaction with modern life and his interest in ancient mystical writings as a more genuine form of knowledge. Finally, not content to merely read about the mystics of old, the vanished librarian ends his journal by confessing that he is journeying to the &quot;desert lands&quot; in search of living mystics from whom he can learn. The narrator very soon decides to travel in his footsteps, and departs for an unnamed location (most likely North Africa) to see what he can find out. The rest of the story details his gradual journey, first into Islam, and then into Sufism (Islam's mystical heart), after which he changes irrevocably. The book is interesting not so much for its plot but, as in any good allegory, for the record of a man's thoughts as he undergoes an inner transformation.While I have read many books on Islam and Sufism, I have not encountered another work quite like this one. Most books on Islam intended for Westerners pander to modern beliefs and prejudices, treating it either as a relic of the past requiring modernization or as a threatening political force. This book treats Islam not as an intellectual or historical abstraction, but rather details the thoughts of a man, initially utterly submerged in the lies and half-truths upon which modern Western society is based, as he abandons his prejudices and comes into contact with the genuine reality offered by spirituality.A brief, biographical note on the author is warranted. Ian Dallas was a Scotsman who travelled to Morocco during the 1960s and became involved with the Shadhili Sufi Order of the highly respected Shaykh Al-'Arabi Ad-Darqawi. After reverting to Islam and studying with the Shaykh for several years (the same period during which he wrote &quot;The Book of Strangers&quot;), the Shaykh appointed Ian Dallas as his successor. To this day, Dallas continues to lead his Order as Shaykh Abdalqadir, and has written many books on the subject of Islam under this name (although he has written a few other works under his original name). Thus, Dallas was uniquely qualified to write this book as a record of how a Westerner can come to understand Islam from within, rather than as an outsider. As such, it is a unique bridge between the modern world of deceit and the timeless, Traditional world of the spirit. If you have any interest at all in Islam, Sufism or any spiritual Tradition as something to be experienced rather than as a mere intellectual abstraction, I highly recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"The book of strangers","review":"I read the Turkish translation of The Book of Strangers twenty years ago. It was translated by the prominent poet smet Ozel and it was a great chance for the Turkish readers.It was an exciting experience for the westernised Turkish intelligentia to read this marvellous story of spritual as well as cultural oddysey written by a westerner. I think it would be as much interesting for all eastern and middle eastern readers living in the western countries or studying in American/British/German/French universities."},{"Title":"The book of strangers","review":"This work is a Sufi version of Hesse's Siddhartha. It's also a good story, and would hold the reader's interest even if he or she had no prior knowledge of Sufism. It's obviously a fictionalized version of the author's discovery of Sufism and Islam, and Dallas has written in such a way that the reader gets a true feeling of the seeker's contact with the mystical tradition of Sufism.

This book is obviously written a few years back since two of the stories in the book talk about kids smoking, but the storyline still keeps them reading.

Each story has a mystery to solve and then at the back of the book it shows why Encyclopedia Brown came to the conclusion he did. We had a great time reading them all together.I would recommend this series to anyone who has children 2nd-5th grade level.

This one is something like a hippie _Tao Te Ching_, and (as another reviewer has noted) its focus is on the energy that some traditions call &quot;ch'i&quot;.Paul Williams originally published this book in 1973 and it became an underground classic in pretty short order. Its title is intended to parallel Marx's _Das Kapital_; Williams's essential thesis is that just as capital replaced land in modern economies, so &quot;energy&quot; will replace capital. (I'm putting the word &quot;energy&quot; in quotation marks so that it won't be misunderstood as having something to do with, say, solar heating or wind electric power generation.)Readers with a background in economics may find Williams unconvincing on this point if they don't see what he's really driving at.For example, at one point he declares roundly that money and property are obsolete concepts. What he really means is that we're on the verge of transcending these concepts _as_ the concepts on which the economy is founded. But he doesn't mean we just won't use money or property any more, or that we'll do away with the concepts altogether; after all, we didn't just stop using land when we started using &quot;capital,&quot; did we?The real, underlying point is that money and property can't be shared in the way that ideas and energy can be. If I give you some of my physical/material property, I have less myself; but if I share an idea with you, then we _both_ have it. (Which is, by the way, a powerful argument against legally enforceable patents, as distinguished from copyrights and other sorts of intellectual property.) Similarly, if I share my &quot;energy&quot; with you, I don't become less conscious or receive less of what I need; just the opposite.For Williams, the spiritual laws governing &quot;energy&quot; are the true foundation on which the human economy is really based. Williams states these spiritual laws and fleshes out the book with lots of spiritual advice of the hippie-wisdom variety; you can look at the book's sample pages to get an idea of where Williams is coming from in this regard.Again, Williams's essential thesis is that the role of these laws in the spiritual economy is about to become clear. Writing in 1973, he was convinced that a sea change in human consciousness was just around the corner and we were about to take the next step in planetary evolution.Was he wrong? I don't think so, but this isn't the place for an extended discussion of the point. Suffice it to say here that the growth of the Internet and the recent development of intellectual property law, prosaic though these phenomena may seem to some, are also an indication that the economy is moving in exactly the direction Williams describes in this book.At any rate, this book is a modern spiritual classic, a masterpiece of &quot;hippie spirituality,&quot; and a good exposition of perennial philosophy. It also, but less obviously, belongs to a sort of &quot;underground libertarian&quot; tradition that predates the '60s: the &quot;energy&quot; in this book is the same &quot;energy&quot; Isabel Paterson was writing about in _The God of the Machine_.Williams's approach to spirituality also goes well with Mary Ruwart's _Healing Our World_, a book I strongly recommend to any libertarian hippies (and anyone else) who may be reading this review."},{"Title":"Das Energi","review":"Das Energi by Paul Williams lives on my bookshelf between Richard Bach's Illusions and Hugh Prather's Notes to Myself. I got this book as a gift when I was in my twenties, and it changed my whole view of the world. Since then, I have given multiple copies to other people as gifts.Paul Williams wrote Das Energi originally in the early '70's as a series of journal notes. The collection of thoughts soon developed an underground following for its insight, challenge to the dominant paradigms of truth, and breezy me-decade prose. Beauty, God, fear, truth, money, good, evil--these are just some of the topics dealt with in this browsable amalgamation of brief paragraphs and good humor.Paraphrasing one thought from the book: you don't grow just from getting up and getting another beer from the refrigerator; you grow when you do things you don't know if you can do. This particular thought stuck with me and has come back to inspire me to face what is difficult from time to time.Definitely worth your time...one of the few books that I keep in my permanent collection!"},{"Title":"Das Energi","review":"\\"This is God speaking\\", says Williams at one point. Well yes, reading this book does rather feel like that much of the time. \\"Das Energi\\" is a mighty powerful and inspirational read. A dynamic (VERY dynamic) mix of Zen ideas, taoism, positive thinking and maybe a bit of Christian morality thrown in for good measure. However, some of the language does place the book firmly in the late sixties and early seventies (man!). Its still brilliant.Paul Williams presents us with quick, sharp \\"blows to the head\\" such as \\"Beware means be aware.\\", \\"Vote with your life. Vote yes.\\", \\"Stop showing off. It isn't what you do. Its what you are that matters.\\", \\"Babies see things as they really are\\" and so on. The uneven format of the book (could be a sentence on one page, a short paragraph on the next, then a short essay on the next) helps you to think more consciously in itself.Having read the book several times over, I finally realized what was missing for me. A sense of humour! An inspirational classic such as \\"Illusions\\" by Richard Bach for example, has the same enlightening quality but gives you a good chuckle too. Still, this is an extraordinary book and I thank Paul Williams for it wholeheartedly. Read this and WAKE UP! ;o)"},{"Title":"Das Energi","review":"About 20 years ago a a friend gave me copies of Illusions and Das Energi...read them she said and move forward.

Most of the authors of post-modern self help are focusing too much energy on manipulation to achieve a re-defined version of love and abundance. I personally feel it's an imitation of the \\"real thing\\", but then again I wax nostalgic over the simple hippie philosophies that came out of the 60's as notably this book attests to that. Even though I wasn't born until 1969! But a lot of things that came out from the 60's are truly classic. This being one them."},{"Title":"Das Energi","review":"I like this book. While to many the ideas seem original, I disagree. Williams has mixed Taoism, I-Ching and Buddhism with a twist of Zen in all of his thoughts in this book. The Energi he talks about it is Ch'i, the original breathe of the universe. He talks about the Receptive and Creative in terms of heaven and earth, which are I Ching trigrams. And he stresses on the Here and Now...which belongs to the Buddhists and Zen.Overall it is a nice book, modernizing the Eastern philosophies quite well."},{"Title":"Das Energi","review":"I received a copy of this book almost 10 years ago, when I was in a very dark time of my life.

This is a GOOD thing! It's the very reason I awarded it 5 stars; if your cup of tea is highbrow social critique, check out Stokes' and Hoover's City on Fire.Sex and Zen &amp; A Bullet in the Head is instead an unapologetic, unabashed celebration of Hong Kong cinema that waggles its tongue at the conventions of political correctness. The authors have also packed in fun trivia and interesting tidbits all fans ought to appreciate. (The sections on poorly translated subtitles floored me with laughter!) This is the book you want to purchase if you want a guided tour into the amazing world of Hong Kong cinema.And to address the criticism of a previous reviewer, yes, this work does contain plot breakdowns and spoilers, but if you use a bit of discretion, this ceases to be a problem. In fact, in many cases this isn't a problem to begin with. The Jackie Chan-type films in particular aren't known for plot; you're riveted by the action, definitely not the melodrama.

There's also a good glossary explaining the durian (among other things) and compilations of choice bad subtitles.

The primary focus of this book was on movies that were \\"less than ten years old\\" (1986-1996; though several older films are mentioned) that \\"encompass a wide range of settings, situations, and subject matter.\\" This does lead to some discussion of films I was not that familiar with and that have not been written about a lot in other books.You understand the essence of the book with the statement in the Introduction \\"...over-intellectualizing film denies the primary purpose of moviegoing: entertainment.\\" While they somewhat forgo this when reviewing several of the Wong Kar-wai films, you are not going to find anything from Ann Hui in here or even important dramatic fare like Center Stage (1992) or the Cantonese realist cinema from the 1950s. You are going to find action, cat-III, supernatural thrillers, HK film noir, martial arts and more action movies described here. You will also find specific chapters on John Woo, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan and Ringo Lam. There is also one chapter that combines Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and Yuen Wah together.The biggest complaint I have read on this book is the fact that many of the summaries are plot recaps that overdo discussing possible spoiler. While the reviews do offer more discussion than that and are penned by several contributing writers including Andy Klein, Chuck Stephens and others besides the two authors, the spoiler aspect can be upsetting if you do not know it is coming (the capsule reviews tend to have less of this). The best approach to reading those is to either avoid the last couple of paragraphs on the films you have not seen and want to see or just avoid reading that review all together. But there are some other bigger issues though including one of my biggest personal vexations - bad information.The Shaw Brothers chapter is definitely outdated though part of that has to due with the fact Celestial bought out library and licensed them for release in 2002. But there is a lot of data that is just plain wrong like Chang Cheh is not the director of Human Lanterns that would be Sun Chung. TVB was not founded in the 80s (it was in 1967) and Run Run Shaw has his hands in that business at least since the 70s (on the official Shaw site he states he launched TVB in 1973 which contradicts what is written on TVBs site). The Shaw Brothers did not make \\"thousands\\" of films either (the real amount appears to be near a thousand). Jimmy Wang Yu does not play in Dirty Ho, which would be Wong Yu. I do feel this chapter can and should be skipped.I did have fun with the book though. The authors and contributing writers do show a love for the cinema and it does show in their writing though sometimes they come up with hilarious statements like \\"There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like movies in which the with takes her head off and throws it at you, and those who don't.\\" and \\"...ain't no Chuck Norris-style hairy-backed sleepwalking.\\" The hex error segments, which are hilariously corrupted translated English from various films, are particularly fun and had me reminiscing of ones I have read in the past. And there is an introduction from Jackie Chan. If the book is inexpensive, you have seen at least some of the films in the book and you are not expecting \\"over-intellectualizing\\" sagacious content then pick this up. Otherwise, well there are many other books out there to choose from.There are two different paperback releases of this book (1996, 1997). I did my review from the 1996 version. I am not sure if there are any differences between the two."},{"Title":"Sex and Zen & A Bullet in the Head: The Essential Guide to Hong Kong's Mind-bending Films","review":"This book is only helpful for those with little knowledge of Hong Kong films. It's more playful than artistic, yet there are some helpful film reviews included. Some of the information is outdated: Web sites, where to buy HK films, etc..., but if your new to HK films and are interested in the pop culture gems that come out of Hong Kong, then check this book out. For those interested in a more in-depth look at Hong Kong films, I recommend City on Fire, by Lisa Stokes and Micheal Hoover."},{"Title":"Sex and Zen & A Bullet in the Head: The Essential Guide to Hong Kong's Mind-bending Films","review":"I just dont get the appeal of this book, I'm sorry. For the most part, all it contains is a bunch of detailed plot information (yes Virginia, including key plot twists and endings) and very little information as to if the movies were any good! Yes, he has some special lists (&quot;movies that rip&quot;), but just not enough. I wanted this book as a reference to all of the HK movies out there, so I could see what was good before plunking down my cash on them - after reading about a few movies, I felt I no longer needed to buy them because I had already seen them. There are much better options."},{"Title":"Sex and Zen & A Bullet in the Head: The Essential Guide to Hong Kong's Mind-bending Films","review":"This has got to be the most useless movie guide on the planet. Basically, all it is a bunch of plot synopses of HK movies. They are not reviews, just summaries of all the plots, BEGINNING TO END. Half of the them don't even tell you if they are good or not! What on earth could possibly be the use for this? If I haven't seen the movie, I don't want to know EVERY SINGLE THING that happens in it before I see it. And if I have seen it, just reading the plot over is pretty useless too. Basically, the authors watched a ton of HK movies and decided that they should get paid for it, so they whipped up a book as fast as they could, without any consideration for how useful it might be, and put it on the market. Make them earn their dough like everyone else. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Number Theory in Science and Communication: With Applications in Cryptography, Physics, Digital Information, Computing, and Self-Similarity (Springer Series in Information Sciences)","review":"It is possible when teaching number theory to drown the reader in theorems, lemmas and corrolaries. So much so that she can get lost in the thickets and fail to appreciate the broad motivating ideas. Schroeder refrains from such a presentation. He is certainly rigorous enough, when needed. But the book is a graceful exposition. Explaining key concepts and proving enough along the way to satisfy most readers.So Euler, Fermat, Gauss and other luminaries make their appearance at numerous points. Along with the classic and still unproven Goldbach Conjecture. Many readers will probably turn to the sections on modern applications, notably in cryptography. The explanation of the public key algorithm is elegant.Other applications include making random numbers. Something quite subtle and difficult to do well. And vitally necessary for cryptography.The last chapter on fractals and self similar transformations is accompanied by a few pretty pictures of fractals and Julia sets in the plane. Though by now most readers must be familiar with fractal art.The only drawback of the book is the lack of problems. Pity, as it reduces the book's suitability as an undergrad text."},{"Title":"Number Theory in Science and Communication: With Applications in Cryptography, Physics, Digital Information, Computing, and Self-Similarity (Springer Series in Information Sciences)","review":"This book provides good examples and has a good mix of number theory and the associated mathematics. Very useful for people interested in cryptography and number theory in general.However, this book is not easy to read and requires some effort to digest the given information."},{"Title":"Survival;: 23 true sportsmen's adventures","review":"These are good old fashioned hunting and fishing outdoor survival stories that are pleasant, light reading. Most of them are short stories, that are about the right length to finish each story in a sitting. I have three Ben East books (published by Outdoor Life) Danger, Explosive True Survival Stories, Narrow Escapes and Wilderness Adventures and this book. I have read each book several times and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys the outdoors."},{"Title":"Survival;: 23 true sportsmen's adventures","review":"Fabulous book of true incidents. A great book about real outoddorsman and their experiences. Nothing is better than a true story."},{"Title":"Clarence the TV Dog.","review":"I read this story over and over as a young girl and I saved my well-worn copy to pass along to my kids. I just recently read Clarence The TV Dog to my 8 year-old son and he enjoyed it just as much as I had. Clarence was a real dog and the book is about the fun little adventures he had in his home and neighborhood with his owners, a young boy and girl and their mother. The author wrote on the back, \\"All the adventures in the book are ones that either have happened to Clarence or might very well happen to him tomorrow.\\" A sequel called \\"Clarence Goes to Town\\" is also very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Clarence the TV Dog.","review":"I had a good memory of this book and now I'm sharing it with my son. It's even better than I remember! The chapters usually end witty and the book ties together nicely at the end. My son has read it many times himself and still asks for it as a read aloud.
